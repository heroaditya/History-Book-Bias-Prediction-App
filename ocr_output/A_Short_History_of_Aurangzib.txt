A SHORT HISTORY OF

BOOK I.
CHAPTER I.

EARLY LIFE, 1618—1659.

81. Significance of fis reign,

The history of Aurangzib is practically the history of India
for sixty years, His own reign (1658-—-1707) covers the second
half of the seventeenth century and stands forth as a most
important epoch in the annals of our country. Under him the
Mughal empire reached its greatest extent, and the largest
single State ever known in India from the dawn of history to
the rise of the British power was formed. From Ghazni to
Chatgaon, from Kashmir to the Karnatak, the continent of India
obeyed one seeptre. Islam made its last onward movement
in India in this reign. The empire thus formed, while un-
precedented in size, was also one political unit. Its provinces
were governed not by the mecliation of sub-kings, but directly
by servants of the Crown. Herein Aurangzib’s Indian empire
was vastec than that of Asoka, or Samudra-gupta or Harsha-
vardhan’,

But the rei that saw the formation of the greatest Indian
etopire of pre-British days, witnessed also unmistakable signs
of iis commencing decline and disruption. Long before Nadie
Shah the Persian or Ahmad Shah the Afghan proved the
dadishah fo be an impotent shadow of royally and Delhi the

mere memory of past greatness, long before the Maratha con-
federacy hid beneath its super-imposed sway the regular
monarchy of the land—~even before Aurangzib closed his eyes
the Mughal empire had turned bankrupt in finance and prestige,
the administration had broken down, the imperial power had
confessed its failure to maintain order and hold this vast
realm together.

The reign of Aurangzib is also marked by the upspringing
of the Maratha nationality out of the ashes of their short-lived
kingship, and by the appearance of the Sikh sect in the role
of warriors and armed opponents of the ruling power. Thus
the supreme factors of Indian history in the [8th and early
19th centuries owe their origin to Aurangzib’s reion and policy.

In the very reign in which the Mughal crescent rounded to
fulness and then began to wane visibly, the first glow of a
new dawn was distinctly secn in our political sky. The future
lords of our country’s destiny gained a firm and safe footing
on its soil, Madras and Bombay became presidencies of the
English East India ‘Company in 1653 and 1687 respectively ;
Caleutia was founded in 1690. The places of shelter thus
gained by the Europeans soon formed a dominion within a
dominion. .

The end of the seventeenth century reveals the Mughal empire
as rotten at the core. The treasury was empty. The imperial
army knew itself beaten and recoiled from its foes. The
centrifugal forces were asserting themselves successfully, and
the empire was reacy for disruption. The moral weakness of
the empire was even greater than the material: the Govern-
ment no longer commanded the awe of fis subjects ; the public
servants had lost honesty and efficiency ; ministers and princes
alike lacked statesmanship and ability; the army broke down
as an instrament of force.

Why was itso? The ruler was free from vice, stupidity, and
sloth. His intellectual keenness was proverbial, and at the same

HIS TRAGIC FAILURE 3

time he took te the business of governing with all the ardour
which men usually display in the pursuit of pleasure in
industry and attention to public affairs he could not be
sutpassed by any clerk. His patience and perseverance were as
remarkable as his love of discipline and order. In privaie
life he was simple and abstemious like a hermit. He faced the
privations of a campaign or a forced march as uncomplainingly
as the most seasoned private. No terror could daunt his heart,
no weakness or pity melt it, Of the wisdom of the ancients
which can be gathered from ethical books, he was a master.
He had, besides, undergone a long and successtul probation in
war and diplomacy in his father’s reign.

And yet the result of fifty years’ rule by such a sovereign
was failure and chaos! This political paradox makes his reign
an object of supreme interest to the slident of political
philosophy no less than to the student of Indian history.

8 2. The tragedy of Aurangsth’s life, how developed.

The life of Aurangzib was one long tragedy,—~a story of:
man battling in vain against an invisible but inexorable Fate, a
tale of how the strongest human enceavour was baffled by the .
forces of the age. A strenuous reign of fifty years ends in
colossal failure. And yet this king was one of the greatest ,
rulers of Asia in intelligence, character, and enterprise. This rr
tragedy in history was developed with all the regularity of a
perfect drama.

The first forty years of his life were spent in steady and
" arduous self-lraining and preparation for the supreme office in
the realm (Book I), This seed-time was followed by a year of
sharp contest for the throne (Book ID, which put ail his powers :
to the test and rewarded his energy, courage and sagacity with
the golden crown of Delhi. Then came twenty-three years of
peaceful and prosperous reign and settled residence in the great
eapitals of Northern India (Book II). With every enemy

removed from his path, the whole empire of India obeying his
command, and wealth and cullure increasing from the peace
and order that his firm and vigilant rule had ensured to the
country,—Aurangzib seemed now to have attained to the
summit ot human happiness and glory. This was the third Act
of his life, and after it began his decline. A pitiles Nemesis,
like that of the Greek tragedy, raised against him an enemy in
the very bosom of his family The rebel son of Shah Jahan
cannot long enjoy his triumph because he is confronted by the
rebellion of his own son Muhammad Akbar (1681),
+ The flight of the deteated rebel to the Maratha king drew
Aurangzib to Southern India, where he was destined to spend
the last 96 years of his life ii tents and wear oul the empire’s
revenue, army, and organized administration as well as his own
health in an unending and fruitless struggle. But the irony of
Fate at first veiled from his eyes and from the eyes ot his
contemporaries the futility of his efforts and the impencling tragic
close of his career. In the fourth Act of his life, which is
comprehended in the tourth Book of this History, ail seemed
to go well with him ;-~Bijapur and Golkonda were annexed,
the Berad chieftain of Sagar was forced to submit, and the
troublesome Maratha ling was brought to the block and his
capital and entire tamily captured (1689). In this result nothing
seemed fo be wanting to complete the triumph of Aurangzib.
But a few thoughtful observers could already discern ominous
signs of the coming doom, peeping oul here and there, while
others were still blinded as to the future by the  brilliancy of
the empire. The seeds that had been sown in the third stage
of his life, unnoticed and in ignorance of their fruits, began to
sprout up in the fourth and he had to gather their baneful
harvest in the fifth and closing period of his life,
Therefore, the tragedy of Aurangzib is concentrated in the
last cighteen years of his life (1689-1707), which form the theme
of Book V. Slowly but with increasing clearness does the

ORIGINAL HISTORICAL SOURCES

A

tragic plot unfold itself, till Aurangzib realizes the true nature of
the forces arrayed against him and the real trend of affairs,
But he does not abandon the struggle; even when the hopeless-
ness of the contest forces itself on him and his Court, his
endeavour is as strenuous as before. He tries new remedies -
he changes his tactics with changes in the political situation and
in the distribution of the enemy forces. At first he sends out
his generals, while himself occupying a central position for their
control and guidance. His generals fail to achieve a decision;
very well, then this old man of eighty-two must go out to
conduct the war in person for six years (1699-1705); and he
retires to Ahmadnagar only when the first summons of death
teaches him. Then, and then anly does he mournfully
recognize Ahmadnagar as destined to be his “journey’s end”
(Khatam~tts~satac).

§ 3. Matecials for fis féstocs.

Happily, the materials for a study of his life are abundant
in Persian, the literary language of Mughal India. First, we
have the official annals—the Padishafnaiafi (in three sections
by three writers) and the Alamgirnamaf--which cover the
41 years lying between the accession of Shah Jahan and the
eleventh year of Aurangzib’s reign. These works were written
by order, on ithe basis of the State papers preserved in the
imperial archives, such as official correspondence, despatches,
news-letters, treaties and revenue returns. They are rich fo
dates and topographical details of the utmost value and accuracy.
For the last forty years of Aurangzib’s reign we have the
concise Masir-i-Alamgité, compiled from the same class of
official records, bat after his death.

Next come a class of private histories, like those of Masum,
Aqil Khan, a Rozbhani soldier in Bengal (metrical), and Khafi
Khan. These were written by officials, but, not having been
meant for the Emperor's eyes, they supply us with many of the


--- Page 13 ---
6 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [er I

facts suppressed in the Couri annals, though — their dates and
names are sometimes inaccurate and their descriptions
meagre,

There are even two histories of Aurangzib’s reign written
by Hindus in the Persian tongue. One is the Nuskha~t~
Dilkasha by Bhimsen Buthanpuri, the business man of Aurangzib’s
general Dalpat Rao Bundela. This author was an active
traveller, with a good eye for topographical details, and a
careful recorder of all he saw from Mathura to Malabar. His
work is of special value for Deccan affairs, because he was
brought up and spent nearly afl his life there. The other is
the Fatufiat-i-Alamgiri of Ishwardas Nagar, who long served
the Shaikh-ultslam and lived at Pattan in Gujrat. This work is
of great importance for Rajput affairs.

Besides these general histories of the reign, we have mono-
graphs in Persian touching only particular episodes or personages
of the time,-such as Niamat Khan Ali's account of the siege of
Golkonda. Shihab-ud-din Talish's diary of the conquesl of Kuch
Bihar, Assam, and Chateaon, the memoirs of Iradal Khan and
of some other servants of Bahadur Shah I which start from
the closing years of Aurangzib’s reign. Of the two Deccan
kingdoms, Golkonda and Bijapur, we have separate _ histories,
which throw light on the dealings of the Mughal Government
with them. For Assam affairs we have the extremely valuable
indigenous annals called Buranjis.

Most fortunately, for several portions of Aurangzib's reign
1 have been able to secure the very raw materials of history,—a
source of information even more valuable than contemporary official
annals described above. These are the manuscript news-leiters
of the imperial Court (a€Aéarat-1-darbar~i~muala) preserved at
jaipur and in the Royal Asiatic Society's library (London) and
the Letters of the actors in the political drama of the {7th
century, of which nearly six thousand, ineluding more than a

them we see events as they happened day by day, and not as
they were dressed up afterwarcls by writers with a purpose.
in them we see the actual hopes and fears, plans and opinions
of those who made Indian history.

The European travellers, Tavernier, Bernier, Careri, and
Manucci, who visited India in this reign, have left long accounts
of the couniry. Their works are of undoubted value as
throwing light on the condition of the people, the state of
trade and industry, and the history of the Christian churches
in India. Moreover, the criticism of Indian manners and
institutions by foreign observers has. a freshness and weight all
itis own. But of the political history of India, apart from the
few events in which they took part or which they personally
witnessed, their report merely reproduced the bazar rumours
and the stories current among the populace, and cannot be
set against the evidence of contemporary histories and letters
in Persian.

& 4 CBildfood and education.

Muhi-ud-din Muhammad Aurangzib, who ascended the throne
of Delhi as Alamgir L, was the sixth child of Shah Jahan and
Mumtaz Mahal. He was born at Dofad’ in the night of 15th
Zigada, 1027 an. (24th October, 1618 av., Old Style).

From 1622 till the end of his father’s reign, Shah Jahan
was under the old Emperor’s disfavour and was driven into
rebellion in self-defence. But the prince’s efforts were
unsuccessful, and he had at last to submit to his father and give
up his young sons, Dara and Aurangezib, as hostages, These
two reached Jahangir’s Court at Lahor in June 1626. Shortly
afterwards Jahangir died, Shah Jahan ascended the throne, and
the two boys were brought fo him at Agra by Asaf Khan (26
February, 1628).

Thus, at the ave of ten he came to a_ settled life; and
arrangements were evidently now made for his regular educa-
tion. Mic Muhammad Hashim of Gilan is recorded as his
teacher. Bernier speaks of Mulla Salih as his old teacher, but
the Persian histories do not bear this statement out

That Aurangzib had a natural keenness of mind and quickly
learnt what he read, we can readily believe. His correspondence
proves that he had thoroughly mastered the Quran and the
Traditional Sayings of Muhammad (fadis), and was ever
ready with apt quotations from them. He spoke and wrote
Arabic and Persian like a scholar. Hindustani was his mother
tongue, the language used by the Mughal Court in private life.
He had some knowledge of Hindi, too, and could talk and
recite popular sayings in that language,

Aurangzib wrote Arabic ina vigorous ahd masterly naskf
hand. In this he used to copy the Quran. Two such
manuscripts of his transcription he presented to Mecca and
Medina, after richly binding and illuminating them. “His
nasialig and sfikasta styles of writing were also excellent,’
says Saqi Mustad Khan, and this we can readily believe, for
Aurangzib was the author of a vast number of jetters, and
made it a point to write orders across all pelitions in his own
hand. He did not like to hear useless poetry, still less fauda-
fory verses. But he made an exception in favour of poems
containing good counsels. “His favourite study was theological
works,—Commeniaries on the Quran, the Traditions of
Muhammad, Canon Law, the works of Imam Muhammad Ghazzali,
selections from the letters of Shaikh Sharf Yahia of Munir, and
Shaikh Zain-ud-din Qutb Muhi Shirazi, and other works of
that class.””

Painting he never appreciated. Music he banished from
his Court, in the outburst of devotion which marked the
completion of the tenth year of his reign. Fine china-ware
he liked) But he had none of his father’s passion for

building. No masterpiece of architecture, no superb or
exquisite mosque,’ hall, or tomb marks his reien. All that he
built were commonplace necessary things, such as the mosques
which marked the scenes of his victories, and the numberless
‘sacais which he built along the imperial highways running fo the
south and the west.

§ 5. Fights an elephant.

One incident of his boyhood made his fame ring through-
out India. On 28th May, 1633, Shah Jahan set two huge
elephants, Sudhakar and Surai-sundar by name, to fight a
combat on the level bank of the Jamuna at Agra. They ran for
some distance and then grappled together just below the balcony
of the morning salute in the fort. The Emperor hastened there
to see the fight, his éldest three sons riding a few paces before
him. Auranozib, intent on seeing the fight, edged his way very
close to the elephants,

The brutes after a while let go their grip and each stepped
back a little. Sudhakar’s spirit was fully roused. Losing sight
of his opponent he turned and charged Aurangzib who was
standing by. The prince, then only fourteen years old, calmly
stood his ground, kept his horse from turning back, and flung
his spear at the elephant’s head. All was now confusion and alarm.
The nobles and the servants ran about shouting, fireworks were
Iet off to scare away the elephant, but all to no effect. The
animal came on and felled Aurangzib’s horse with a sweep
of his long tusk. But the prince fumped up from the ground
drew his sword, and faced the raging beast. Just then his
elder brolher Shuja forced his way through the crowd and

smoke, galloped up to the elephant, and wounded it with his
spear. Rajah Jai Singh, teo, came up and atiacked the elephant.
And now an unlooked for diversion came to the princes’ aid.
The other elephant, Surat-sundar, ran up to renew the combat,
and Sudhakar, daunted by the spear-thrusts and fireworks
discharged at him, fled from the field with his rival thundering
at his heels. The princes were saved. Shah Jahan clasped
Aurangzib to his bosom, praised his courage, and gave him the
tile of Bofhadur or ‘hero’ The courtiers cried out that the
boy had inherited his father’s reckless courage, and reminded
each other how Shah Jahan in his youth had attacked a wild
tiger sword in hand before the eyes of Jahangir.

On this occasion Aurangzib gave a foretaste of his lofty
spirit. When his father lovingly chid him for his rash courage,
he replied, “If the fight had ended fatally for me if would not
have been a matter of shame. Death drops the curtain even
on Emperors ; if is no dishonour.”

On 13th December, 1634, he got his first post in the
Mughal peerage, with the rank of a Commander of Ten
Thousand Horse. Next September he was sent to the Bundela
expedition in order to learn the art of war and the control of
men by actual experience.

§ 6 Fée Bundela War, 1638. ;

Bir Singh Dev, the Bundela Rajah of Urchha, had risen to
great wealth and power through the favour of Jahangir, at whose
bidding he had murdered Abul Fazl. His son Jhujhar Singh,
who succeeded him in 1627, proved refractory in Shah Jahan’s
reign. He seized the old Gond capital of Chauragarh, slew ifs
Rajah Prem Narayan, and seized his treasure amounling {o ten
lakhs of Rupees. The victim’s son appealed to Shah Jahan (1635,)

The Emperor sent three armies to converge upon and invade
Bundelkhand, with the help of Devi Singh, a descendant of
another branch of the Bundela royal family, to whom the throne

whose high position would enforce discipline and ensur weg
of plan and co-operation among the three Mughal ines ae
who were of equal rank. For this purpose Aurangzib was

appointed as the nominal head of the expedition. He was to
slay in the rear, but the generals were noi to act without
consulting him.

On @nd October, 1635 a hillock near Urchha was stormed
by Devi Singh’s men, and on the 4th the Mughals took Urchha
jiself. Jhujhar had lost heart and fled to Dhamuni and thence,
across the Narmada, to Chauragarh. The Mughals, after captur-
ing Dhamuni (18th Oct), took up the chase of Jhujhar, who
was hunted through the Gond countries of Deogarh and Chanda,
undergoing terrible privations and fatigue and abandoning his
men and property at every sfep. At last, when sleeping in the
heart of the jungle, the fugitive princes were surprised by the
Gonds and done io death (Dec.) Such of their wives and
daughters as had survived the jaufiar rite (self-immolation)
were dragged into the Mughal harem. Two sons and one
grandson of Jhujhar, being of tender age, were made
Musalmans ; another son and the minister of the late Rajah refused
to apostatize and were executed in cold blood. The Jofiy temple
of Bir Singh at Urchha was demolished and a mosque was
erected on its site. The fort of Jhansi was taken (end of
October) and the spoils of war, including the buried treasure
of Bir Singh, amounted to one krore of Rupees,

“Towards the close of Akbar’s reign, the Mughal empire began
fo expand southwards beyond the Narmada river. Khandesh
was annexed in 1599, then Berar and finally in 1600 the city
of Ahmadnagar. His boy Sultan Nizar Shah was deposed and
his kingdom annexed ta the Mughal empfre. But the annexation

was in name only, as the Mughals could not eftectively occupy
the new conquest. During Jahangir’s feeble reign there was a
revival of the Nigam-shahi dynasty and power under the wise
and vigorous regency of Malik Ambar, an Abyssinian slave of
rare genius and capacity. His wise revenue system made the
peasantry happy, while enriching the Slate. A born leader of
men, he conciliated all parties, maintained order, and ‘eft a
name for justice, vigour and public benefit which has not been
yet forgotten. Building up a grand alliance of the Deccani
Powers and fully using the Maratha light cavalry, he drove the
Mughals back.

Shah Jahan, on his accession in 1627, which just followed
Malik Ambar’s death, began a vigorous policy in the Decean.
The new Nigzam-shahi capital Daulaiabad was captured with
Husain Shah, the last king of the dynasty (1633) But a fresh
complication now arose. The Sultans of Bijapur (Adil Shah)
and Golkonda (Qutb Shah) tried to seize the adjoining parts
of the fallen kingdom of Ahmadnagar. Shahji, the father
of the famous Shivaji, with Bijapuri help, set up a puppel Nizam
Shah and ruled a portion of the country in his name,

Shah Jahan made heroic exertions to establish his rights. Por
more efficient administration, Daulalabad and Ahmadnagar were
now sepatated from the province of Khandesh and placed
under another viceroy (Nov. 1634). In February 1636 the
Emperor himself arrived in the Deccan to direct the operations,
Three Mughal armies, totalling 50,000 men, were held ready
to be launched upon Bijapur and Golkonda, while a fourth
(8,000 strong) invaded Maharashtra. Qutb Shah immediately
submitted in terror, promised an annual tribute of two lakhs
of fun, and proclaimed the Mughal Emperor as his suzerain,

The king of Bijapur made a stand for his independence,
But the three Mughal armies at once entered his kingdom,
utterly desolating the fields and villages and enslaving the
population. At last in May 1636 a compromise was made. By this


--- Page 20 ---
1636] MUGHAL CONQUESTS IX DECCAN 13

treaty, the late Nigam-shahi kingdom was divided between the
two Powers, the Bijapur Sultan getting Sholapur and Wang
(between the Bhima and the Sina rivers), Bhalki and Chidgupa
(in the north-east), the Puna district and North Konkan,—in all
yielding a revenue of 90 lakhs of fun (or 80 lakhs of Rupees).
The rest of the Ahmadnagar State was annexed to the Mughal
empire. In addition, Adil Shah recognized the overlordship of
{he Mughal Emperor, promised to be friendly to his fellow-
vassal the Sultan of Golkonda (whose boundary was fixed at
the Manjera river), and bound himself to pay an indemnity of 20
lakhs of Rupees, but no annual tribute. 3

The affairs of the Deccan having been at last settled and the
Mughal boundary clearly marked and publicly recognized by
the local princes, Shah Jahan returned to Northern India, leaving
Aurangzib (14th July, 1636) as viceroy of the Deccan, with his
seat al Aurangabad. This town, founded by Mali Ambar, at
the village of Khirki, was allowed by Shah Jahan to be named
Aurangabad atter his third son.

The Mughal conquesis in the Deccan were completed by the
capture of the forls of Udgir @8th Sep.) and Ausa (19th Oct),
and the crushing defeat of Shahji Bhonsle, who, after a long
chase by the Mughal general Khan-i-Zaman and his Bijapuri
auxiliary Randaula Khan, had to make a complete surrender
at Mahuli (in North Konkan) at the end of October. He gave
up to the Mughals his puppet Nigam Shah with his royal
property, seven forts, and all bis territories in Maharashtra
except his small jagirs in the Puna district, which were to be
held as a vassal of Bijapur.

Another Mughal general, Khan-i-Dauran, levied heavy
emuribulions from the Gond Rajah of Deogarh and other
chiefs. In January 1638, Aurangzib sent an army ito conquer
Baglana, a small kingdom north of the Chandor range lying on
the main route from the Deccan to Gujrat and containing the
famous hill-forts of Salhir and Mulhir. Mulhir and Pipla were

gained and the entire kingdom annexed by the end of June.
Next year (1639), in October, Aurangzib caused the Maratha
freebooter Kheloji Bhonsle, a son of Shabji’s paternal uncle, to

be seized and put to death.

$8, Aurangzib's Family.

Aurangzib had four wives, namely :

{. Ditras Banu Begam, a daughter of Shah Nawaz Khan
(whose greai-grandlather was a younger son of the Persian
king Shah Ismail [ Safavi). She was married to Aurangzib at
Agra on 8th May 1657 with the most gorgeous ceremonies.
She died at Aurangabad on 8th October 1657 from illness
following the birth of her son Muhammad Akbar, and was
buried outside that city, with the title of Rabia~ud-daurani or
the modern Saint Rabia. Her tomb, popularly called the
Deccani Taj Mahal, was repaired by her son Azam under
order of Aurangzib. She seems to have been an imperious
lady, proud of bearing the ‘Royal blood of Persia,’ and her
husband stood in awe of her. [Anecdotes of Aurangzib,
No. 27.]

9, Rahmat-un-nisa, surnamed Nawab Bat, was the daughter
of Rajah Raju of the Rajauri State in Kashmir, and came of
the hili-Rajput blood. But on her son Bahadur Shah's
accession to the throne of Delhi, a false pedigree was
invented for her in order to give that Emperor the right to
call himself a Sayyid. She built a sara/ at Fardapur, at the
foot of the pass, and also founded Baijipura, a suburb of
Aurangabad. The misconduct of her sons, Muhammad Sultan
and Muazzam, who disobeyed the Emperor under the influence
of evil counsellors, embittered her latter life. Her advice and
eveh personal entreaty had no effect on Muagzam, who was
at last placed under arrest. Nawab Bai seems to have lost
her charms and with them her husband's favour rather early

plague carried her off at the city of Bijapur in October or
November 1688.

cofitemporary Venetian traveller Manucci speaks of her as a
Georgian slave-girl of Dara Shukoh’s harem, who, on the
downfall of her first master, became the concubine of _ his
victorious rival. She secms to have been a very young
woman at the time, as she first became a mother in 1667.
She retained her charms and influence over the Emperor
till his death, and. was the darling of his old age, Under
the spell of her beauty he pardoned the many faults of Kam
Bakhsh and overlooked her freales of drunkenness which
must have shocked so pious a Muslim.

Besides the above four there was another woman whose
supple grace, musical skill, and mastery of blancdishments,
made her the heroine of the only romance in the puritan
Emperor’s life. Hira Bai surnamed Zainabad? was a young
slave-girl in the keeping of Mir Khalil, who had married a
sister of Aurangzib’s mother. During his viceroyalty of the
Deccan, the prince paid a visit to his aunt af Burhanpur.
There, while strolling in the park of Zainabad on the other
side of the Tapti, he beheld Hira Bai unveiled among his
aunt’s train. The artful beauty “on seeing a mango-tree laden
wilh fruits, advanced in mirth and amorous play, jumped
up, and plucked a mango, as if unconscious of the prince's
presence.” The vision of her matchless charms stormed
Aurangzib’s heart ina moment; “with shameless importunity

infatuated wilh her.” So much 50, that one day she offered

entreaties and excuses were disregarded, and the helpless
lover wag about to taste the forbidden drink when the sly
enchantress snatched away the cup from his lips and said,
“My object was only to test your Jove for me, and not to
make you fall into the sin of drinking!’ Death cut the story
short when she was still in the bloom of youth. Aurangzib—

§ 9. Aurangszib in disgrace.
Aurangzib’s first viceroyalty of the Deccan ended strangely
in his disgrace and dismissal, in 1644.

the passage, and she was so severely burnt that for four
manths she hovered between life and death.

The Physician Royal of Delhi laboured in vain to heal
her burns, but a slave named Arif prepared an ointment which
entirely healed her sores. On 25th November began a most
splendid and costly festivity in celebration of her complete
recovery. At her request Aurangzib was restored to his
father’s favour and his former rank and office, which he had
jest in the meantime.

Aurangzib had arrived at Agra on 2nd May to see his
sister. Here three weeks afterwards he had been suddenly
dismissed from his post, and deprived of his rank and allowance.
From one of his letters we gather that he resigned his post as
a protest against Dara’s persistent hostility and Shah Jahan’s
partiality to his eldest son which robbed Aurangzib of the
Emperor's confidence and support. He felt that his prestige
was lowered in the public eye and he could not govern the
Deccan consistently with self-respect or with any chance of
doing good service.*

At Jahanara’s intercession the Emperor restored Aurangzib
to his favour, and on 16th February, 1645, seni him off to
Gujrat as Governor. His viceroyalty of this province ended
in January, 1647, when he was appointed to Balkh,
But even in this brief period of fess than fvo years he showed
his administrative capacity and firmness. ‘

Aurangzib followed an active and firm policy towards the
reober tribes and rebels of Gujrat. In order to check them
effectually he engaged soldiers in excess of the men whom he

was bound by his present rank as a mansabdar fo keep.
He thus established in his father’s eyes a repulation for capa-
ey and courage, and if wasnot long before he was called
away fo a far off scene where there was supreme need of
ihese qualities, by being created Governor and Commander-in-
Chief of Balkh and Badalehshan (21 Jan. 1647)

S10. Aurangeib’s campaigns in Balkh, (647.

The provinces of Balkh and Badakhshan, lying immediately
beyond the Hindu Kush range north of Kabul, were dependencies
of the Ringcdom of Bukhara. Their king, Nazar Muhammad
Khan, was a weak and incompetent ruler, who alienated all
classes of his subjects. Within three years of his accession fo
the throne, rebellions broke out in many patts of his vast
kingdom (1645). Shah Jahan seized the opportunity by sending
an expedition to conquer Balkh and Badakhshan, “because these
two provinces were the heritage of Babar and also lay in the
way fo Samargqand, the capital of Timur, who had founded the
Mughal dynasty.”

In 1646, Prince Murad Bakhsh with a vast army easily
occupied Badakhshan and Balkh, in the month of June. But the
prince and his officers alike detested service in the poor, cul
and uncongenial tancl of Central Asia and dreaded any contest
with the flerce Uzbaks from beyond the Oxus. Soon (Aucust)
Murad returned from Balkh, against the Emperor’s wishes,
leaving his army without a leader |! Aurangzib was then sent
to relrieve the situation. Leaving Kabul on 7th April 1647,
with Ali Mardan Khan as his right-hand man, he fought his
way through the Uzbak hordes step by siep anc reached the
city of Balkh on 25th May.

Aziz Khan, the able and and heroic eldest son of Nazar
Muhammad. Under his directions the Uzbak hordes assembled

at different places in Balkh and threatened to isolate and invest
the Mughal troops. When Aurangzib marched out of the city
of Balkh to break up the enemy gathering at Aqcha (40 miles
to the north-west), he was daily opposed by the Uezbaks on
the way, while another body of them arrived from Bukhara to
attack the city of Balkh. The news of it forced Aurangzib to
fall back on his capital, fighting every inch of the ground.
This march and retreat took up ten days during which the
Mughal army was a sfranger fo repose. Day after day a
strenuous fight had io be mainfained against the tireless and
mobile enemy, while hunger raged in the imperial ranks. The
soldiers were ever on the move, and food could be cooked
only on the backs of the marching elephants | Bread sold at
one Rupee or even two Rupees a piece and water was equally
dear, and there was not cnough for all. But in the midst of
all this hardship and danger, Aurangzib’s firmness and control
prevented any slackness or disorder; his watchful eye and
active body hastened to the suecour of every weak spot, and
his wisdom and courage brought the army back to safety.
Aurangzib’s grim tenacity had gained its object Abdul Aziz
now desired to make peace. His hope of crushing Auranezib
had failed. He had personally witnessed a striking proof of
the prince’s cool courage ; for, one day the hour of evening
prayer arrived when the battle was at its hottest; Aurangzib
spread his catpet on the field, knelt down and calmly said his
prayers, regardless of the strife and din around him. He was
then, as during the rest of the campaign, without armour and
shield. The Bukhara army gaged on the scene with wonder,
and Abdul Aziz, in generous admiration, stopped the fight,
erging: “To fight with such man is to court one’s own ruin.”
Abdul Aziz proposed that Balkh should be delivered to his
younger brother Suban Quli, as Shah Jahan had publicly
offered to restore the country to their father. Aurangzib
referred the question to the Emperor, who decided to restore

the country to Nazar Muhammad, if the latter saved imperial
prestige by begging the Emperor’s pardon !

This was done. On ist October the fort of Balkh was
delivered to Nazar Muhammad's agents, and the Mughal army
began its retreat to Kabul, undergoing terrible privations and
loss of life and treasure in crossing the Hindu Kush passes, in
the teeth of attacks from the rear and front by Uzbaks and
Hazaras. The imperialists lost 5,000 men in this region,
besides an equally large number of transport animals. The
grain and other provisions and military stores which the
Mughals had to abandon were worth several lakhs of Rupees.
The war cost the Indian treasury four «rores of Rupees, while
nol an inch of territory was gained as the result of it

After the Balkh expedition, Aurangzib acted as governor
of Multan and Sindh from March 1648 to July 1652. During
this period he was twice called away from his province fo
lay siege to Qandahar and to try to wrest that fort from the
Persians, January to December 1649 and March to July 1659),
His new province contained the wildest and most untractable
Afghan and Baluch clans. What Aurangzib could do in that
short time was to strike down the most notorious brigand
chieftains and secure a nominal profession of allegiance to the
Emperor from the border clans.

He also set himself to revive the commerce of the province
by affording facilities to the maritime trade. Taita having
ceased to be a port by the accumulation of sand at the river
mouth, Aurangzib opened a new port further down the Indus
and built there a fort and a dock.

§ 11. Aurangzib besieges Qandabat, 1649-1662.

The fort of Qandahar guatds the road to India from the
west and to Kabul from the south. Its strategie importance
lies in the fact that only 360 miles of level country separate
it from Herat, near which the lofly Hindu Kush range sinks

down to afford an easy passage to an invading host from
Central Asia or Persia. Such an army must pass through
Qandahar and must be turned back there, it ever at all. In
an age when Kabul was a part of the Delhi empire, Qandahar
was our inclispensable first line of defence.

In the seventeenth century, when the Portuguese navy
dominate the Indian Ocean and nearly closed the sea-route
from India to the Persian Gul, the commercial importance of
Qandahar was no less than its strategic. All westward-bound
merchandise from [ndia and even the Spice Islands had to
follow the land route through Multan, Pishin and Qandahar
lo Persia and thence to Europe. In 16{5 fourteen thousand
loaded camels annually passed into Persia by this route, and
the city of Qandahar grew rapidly in wealth and size as a
most convenient centre for the exchange of commodities.

From its position Qandahar was naturally a bone of
coniention between the rulers of Persia and India. In 1522
Babar gained it trom its Arshun ruler, but the Persian king
conquered it in 1558. Then Akbar bought it from ils Persian
prince-governor in 1594; but in Jahangir’s olf age, Shah
Abbas the Great took it aller a siege of 45 days (1693.) In
1638 its Persian governor Ali Mardan Khan, afraid of his
master's wrath, delivered the fort to Shah Jahan. But the
Persians were not to be denied: in February 1649 they fnally
wrested it from the Mughals, after a siege of 37 days, while
Shah Jahan delayed sending a relieving force.

Imperial prestige required thal Qandahar should be won
back from the Persians, and ihree costly sieges were under-
taken by Shah Jahan’s sons, but all to no avail. The first
expedition, under Aurangzib and the wazir Sadullah Khan,
30,000 strong, arrived before Qandahar on Idth May [649
and completely invested the fort: but their lack of large
cannon made it impossible for them fo assault the fort, which
was far superior in the calibre and range of its arlillery. As

the Delhi Court historian frankly admits, “The Persians had
grown expert in the capture and defence of forts, by their
long wars with the Turks. They were masters of fire-arms
and artillery. They held such a strong and well-provisioned
fort, with big guns and skilful gunners ...,. So the imperialists
failed with all their efforts.” On Sth September, Aurangzib
began his retreat from Qandahar, after having — wastecl
3 months and 90 days before it, though in a piiched battle
on the bank of the Arghandab, some 24 miles south-west of
Qandahar, his generals Qalich Khan and Rustam Khaa
Deccani signally defeated a large Persian army and pursued
it beyond Kushk-i-Nakhud.

Preparations were made ona grander scale for a second
attempt fo recover Qandahar. Again Autangzib and  Sadullab
Khan appeared before the fort and laid siege to it (Qnd May
1652). Batteries were raised for breaching the walls, and
renches were run towards the ditch of the fort; an aftemp}
was made to drain the ditch dry, and a night allack on the
peak of the ridge behind the Forty Steps (CA‘sit Zina) tovrers
was cleliverecl. But all the efforts of the Mughals failed. “The
trenches could not be carried any nearer in face of ihe severe
fire showered from the fort walls... The enemy issued on
three sides, and from sunset fo dawn fired their muskets
incessantly from loopholes in the fort-walls, so as to give no
opportunity to Aurangzib’s workmen to make progress.” In
fact, the Persian artillery was as excellent as the Mughal was
inefficient. The Indian gunners were proverbially bad marks-
men and their fire produced no effect on the fort-walls.

Within a month of opening the siege, the work of draining
the ditch and running mines had to be suspended for lack
of materials. The Persians made repeated sorties killing and
wounding the Mughals in the trenches and damaging their
guns. Even afler two months of bombardment the fort-walfs
were unbreached, and it would have been madness to deliver


--- Page 31 ---
24 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cu. I

an assault on such a fort. Finally, by Shah Jahan’s order
the Mughal army raisecdl the siege and began ifs retreat from
Qandahar on 9th July.

Shah Jahan was very angry with Aurangzib for this ill-
success, which he wrongly ascribed to the prince’s incapacity.
But in truth it is unjust to blame Aurangzib for the failure to
fake Qandahar. Throughout the siege he was really second
in command. The Emperor from Kabul directed every move-
ment through Sadullah Khan. His sanction had to be taken
for every important step.

Aurangzib’s best justification was afforded next year, when
a still vaster and costlier expedition against Qandahar led by
Dara Shukoh met with an even more humiliating defeat.
These three futile sieges cost the Indian treasury over ten
Xrores of Rupees, and ruined Mughal prestige in the eyes of
all Asia. The Persian king could rightly boast that the rulers of
Delhi knew how to steal a fort by means of gold, but not
how to conquer it by strength of arm. Naturally the military
fame of Persia rose very high. Throughout the rest of the
century the rumour of a projected invasion from Persia used
to throw the Court of Delhi into the greatest alarm. For
years afterwards the Persian peril hung like a dark cloud on
the western frontier of India, and the Emperor Aurangzib and
his ministers drew their breath more easily when any warlike
Shah of Bersia died.

CHAPTER I

SECOND VICEROVALTY OF THE DECCAN
1652—1658.

8 1. Decay and misery of Mughal Deccan ;
financial difficulties.

On his return from Qandahar to Kabul, Aurangzib was
appointed subahdar of the Deccan for the second time (1659).
After nine months’ halt af Burhanpur on the way, he arrived
at his capital, Aurangabad in November 1653 and there spent
the next four years, leaving it only to invade Golkonda and
Bijapur and finally departing on Sth February 1658 to contest
the throne of Delhi.

Since Aurangzib had laid down the viceroyalty of the
Deccan in May 1644, the Mughal administration there had not
prospered, True, the country enjoyed unwanted repose, but
much cultivated soil had lapsed into jungle, the cultivators
had declined {fn number and resources, and the revenue had
failen off greatly, This wretched state of things was the natural
result of a succession of short viceroyalties and incompetent
viceroys. ¢

The Deccan had long caused a heavy drain on the
imperial treasury. The province was large, the country broken,
with plenty of jungles, and imperfectly settled and organized,
and there were two powerful States across the frontier.
Therefore, a very large force had ta be stationed there, But
as the soil was sterile, bad harvests and scarcities were too
frequent, and the standard revenue was never collected. For
the four provinces which then constituted Mughal Deccan, it
stood at three £rores and 62 /akfs of Rupees a year; but the
actual collection in 1652 was only one &rore or less than


--- Page 33 ---
26 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cH. I

one-third. Hienee, the public income of the Deccan did not
balance the expenditure, and the deficit had fo be made
good by sending money from the older and richer provinces
of the empire to support the administration of the South.

On his arrival in the Deccan, Aurangzib was faced with a
serious financial difficulty. The actual yield of the /agirs was
only a fraction of their nominal revenue. The Mughal officers
posted in the Deecan would have starved if they had to
depend solely on their jagirs in that province. Everywhere
Aurangzib found signs of maladministration, the work of his
predecessors. The actual collection was sometimes only
one-tenth of the normal assessment. The new viceroy found
it impossible to make both ends meet At this time the civil
and military expenditure of the Deccan, exclusive of the salary
derived by the officers from their jagirs, produced an annual
deficit of Rs. 20,356,000, which was made good by drawing on
the reserve stored in the treasuries of the Deccan,

Aurangzib shared the difficulty of other jagirdars in the
Deccan in having to keep up his normal contingent of troops
on an income reduced to a fraction of his normal pay. The
financial wrangle between father and son dragged on for years.
Shah Jahan wished to put a stop to the drain of money to
the Deccan, and here was Aurangzib askine for cash from
other provinces in the place of jagfrs in the Deccan !

When appointing him to the Deccan, Shah Jahan had urged
Aurangeib to pay special attention {fo the improvement of the
peasaniry and the extension of cultivation. Aurangzib had
promised to do hi» best for these objects. He only pleaded
for a suificiently long tenure and the men and money necessary
for his purpose, as the depopulation and ravage caused by
a generation of warfare, followed by ten years of maladminis-
tration, could not be undone in tvo or three years,
Very soon his viceroyalty was destined to become memorable
for ever in the history of land-seitlement in the Deccan.

1653} REVECNUL REFORMS IN MUGHIL precay Q7

$2. Muishid Quit Khan; fis characte and revenue system.

Mursyip Qutr Kuan was a native of Khurasan who had
migrated to India in the train of Ali Mardan Khan, the
fugitive Persian governor of Qandahar. He “combined the
valour of a soldier with the administrative capacity of a civil
servant.” As diwan ot Aurangsib in the Deccan, Murshid
Quli effected revenue reforms and first achieved success for
his new system.

The Deccan hitherto had no revenue system at all,
Here the marking out of plots, the measurement of
land by chain survey, the assessment of revenue at so much
per digfa, or the sharing of the actual produce between the
State landlord and the cultivator, were unknown. The peasant
in the Deccan cultivated as much land as he could with a
plough and a pair of oxen, grew whalever crop he liked,
and paid to the State a small amount per plough,—the rate of
revenue varying in different places and being fixed arbitrarily.
Thus the peasantry lay open to the caprice and extortion of
the petty collectors, The long wars of Mughal aggression and
a succession of rainless years completed their ruin. The
oppressed ryots fled from their homes, the deserted fields
lapsed into junele ; many once flourishing villages became
manless wildernesses.

The new diwen’s reform consisted in extending Todar Mal’s
system to the Deccan. First, he worked hard to gather the
scatiered ryots together and restore the normal fife of the
villages by giving them their full population and proper chain
of officers. Everywhere wise amins and honest surveyors
were depuled to measure the land, to prepare the record of
well marked out holdings (ragba), and to distinguish arable
land from rocky soils and water-courses. Where a village had
Jost its headman (mugaddam) he took care to appoint a new
headman from the persons whose character gave the best


--- Page 35 ---
28 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZID [cm Il

promise of their readiness to promote cultivation and take
sympathetic care of the peasantry. The poorer ryofs were
granted foans (fagavvi) from the public treasury, for the pur-
chase of cattle, seeds and other needful materials of agriculture,
and the advance was recovered at harvest by instalments.

He had the wisdom fo modify his system according to
differences of local conditions. Where the peasantry were
backward and the population scanty, or where the villages
situated in obscure nooks, he left the old usage of a

places he introduced the system of metayership or sharing of
the actual produce.

His third method of revenue setilement was the elaborate
of Northern India. Here the standard or

and complex one
share was one-fourth of the total pro-

maximum Government
duce, whether grain or pot-herb, fruit or seed. The revenue at
the fixed rate of so many Rupees per bigha was assessecl and
collected affer considering the quantity and quality of the crop
from seec-time to harvest and its market-price, and actually
measuring the sown area, This became the prevalent
system in the subafs of Mughal Deccan and was known for
centuries afterwards as “the dfara of Murshid Quli Khan.”
His excellent system, backed by his constant vigilance and
personal supervision, [ed to the improvement of agriculture
and increase of the revenue in a few years.

§ 3. Jmprovemenis made in the Deccan administration by
Aurangzib.

Immediately on assuming the viceroyalty, Aurangzib tried
his best to make the administration efficient. Old and incom~
pelent men were dismissed or removed to minor posts; a
number of officers of proved ability were selected by the
prince, and fo them all situations of trust and importance were
given. Keen on securing military efficiency, Aurangzib first of


--- Page 36 ---
1654] DIFFICULTIES DURING VICEROYALTY OF DECCAN 29

all assured that financial support without which an army cannot
be kept up to the mark.

A very able and — energetic Inspector-General of
Ordnance soon made a clean sweep of the old abuses. He
visited every forl, inspected everything, great and small, and
stipplied every place with the requisite store of food and
munitions, Old and useless men who were being borne on
the establishment of the artillery were made to undergo an
examination in musketry. Those who could not hit the mark
even once were dismissed. Old and disabled soldiers were
put on pension in consideration of their past services. Thus
this officer effected a saving of Rs, 50,000 a year, while
actually improving the efficiency of the arm.

8 4. Causes of Aurangzib's differences with the Emperoe.

Aurangzib’s second viceroyalty of the Deccan was marked
by a series of wrangles with his father. Either Aurangzib’s enemies
had got hold of the Emperor’s ears, or the later failed to
appreciate the prince’s difficulties in the South. Aurangzib was
misunderstood, suspected, and unjustly reprimanded from the very
beginning of his term of office. And the bitterness of feeling
thus aroused was one of the reasons why the War of Succession
was conducted so heartlessly and unscrupulously.

At the very time of his appointment to the Deccan Aurangzib
objected fo it as bis jagits there would yield 17 lakhs of
Rupees fess thanthe fertile fiefs he was ‘holding in Sindh.

His proposal to be given more productive fagirs in exchange
for the existing ones, was the cause of prolonged and acrimonious
correspondence with the Emperor,

In some cases the viceroy’s recommendations for postings
and promoiions among his subordinates were not accepled by
the Emperor, and the prince wrote indignantly to his father,
“tT have been a stibahdar since the age of 18 years, and J have


--- Page 37 ---
30 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cn Il

never recommended a single man who has proved unfit for
his post.” On many other minor poinis there were differences
between father and son.

Another cause of friction was the charge of diplomatic
relations with Bijapur and  Golkonda. Aurangzib justly
contended that the Mughal envoys at these Courts should
fake their orders from the viceroy of the Deccan and imperial
correspondence with them should pass through his hands. But
this power was conceded to him only towards the close of
his administration, and even then not fully.

At one time Aurangzib was so disousted with being con-
stantly misunderstood, censured, and hampered by the Emperor,
that he refused to fake a most necessary step on his own
initiative, but justified his inaction with the bitter remark, “No
wonder that I did not take the responsibility of doing it, seeing
that I have been taken to task for acts which I never did. J
have now grown more cautious !”

In 1637 Khan-i-Dauran had invaded Deogarh and foreed the
Rajah to promise an annual tribute of 14/5 lakhs of Rupees
fo the Emperor. But the tribute fell into arrears, and repeated
demands for it produced no effect. So, in 1655, Shah Jahan
ordered the country to be invaded. The Gond Rajah, Kesari
Singh, made a prompt submission and promised to pay up his
arrears.

The Httle Stale of Jawhar, lying on a plateau north of

known under the name of Gondwana. The great Gond
kingdom of Garh-Mandla had been crippled by a Mughal
invasion and sack of the capital in Akbar’s reign, and, later
by Bundela encroachments from the north. Bul about the
middle of the 17th century another Gond kinedom, with ifs
capiial at Deogarh, rose fo greatness, and extended its sway
over the districts of Betul, Chindwara and Nagpur, and portions
of Seoni, Bhancdara and Balaghat, In the southern part of
Gondwana stood the town of Chanda, the seat of a third
Gond dynasty, the hereditary foe and rival of the Rajah of
Deogarh.

8 6. Golkonda : wealtfi of the Kingdom ; causes of quarrel
with the Mughals.

GoLkonpA was a very fertile and carefully irrigated
country, with a large and industrious population. The capital,
Haidarabad, was at this time the centre of the diamond trade,
not of Asia alone, but of the whole world. Numbers of
foreign tracers assembled here and transacted business. The
kingdom was famous for several industries and also possessed
in Masulipatam the best anchorage in the Bay of Bengal. The
forests of the kingdom sheltered large herds of highly prizect
elephants, which added to the wealth of the Ring. Tobacco
and the palin flourished exceedingly, and the excise on tobacco
and toddy juice yielded a large revenue.

Aurangzib had frequent cause fo quarrel with the king of
Golkonda. The annual tribute of two lakhs of Aun was
always in arrears, and frequent dunning on the part of the
Mughal viceroy only met with excuses and petitions for delay.

Next, the exchange value of the fun rose from Rs. 4 in
1636 to Rs. 4!/2 and finally in 1654 to Rs. 5 each. Qutb
Shah had been paying his tribute at the old rate of eight
lakhs of Rupees a year. The Mughals now demanded that


--- Page 39 ---
32 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cen I

the difference due to exchange for al/ lhe past years
should be paid at once, this forming a new burden of 20
lakhs of Rupees.

Then he was rebuked for not having taken his overlord’s
sanction before conquering the Karnatak. Lastly there was
the affair of Mir Jumla which precipitated war.

87. Mie jumla: fis history and position.

The treaties of 1656 had clearly marked out the boundary
between the Mughal empire and the two Deccani monarchies.
Barred in the north by the strong’ arm of the Mughals, these
two States began to give employment to their troops and a
free vent to their ambition by engaging in a career of conquest
in other directions. The whole of the Karnatak, from the
fiver Krishna fo Tanjore beyond the Kaveri, was covered
with a number of petty Hindu principalities, the jarring frag-
ments of the ruined empire of Vijaynagar. These now rapidly
fella prey to Muslim arms. The Golkonda troaps advanced
conquering to the Bay of Bengal, and occupied the country
from the Chilka lake to the Penner tiver.

Bijapur advanced conquering southwards and then turned
east till it occupied the coast between finji and Tanjore.
Hemmed in in the north and south by the conquests of the two
Sultans, as between the two jaws of a monster, lay the king-
dom of Chandragiri, the last remnant of the Vijaynagar
empire, with ils territory contracted to the region from Nellore
fo Pondicherry on the east and the Mysore frontier on the
west. There was now a race between the Gnolkonda and
Bijapur kings for the absorption of this kingdom ; the two
jaws began rapidly to close from the north and the south
upon the doomed Karnatak. In this work of conquest a
roost conspicuous part was played by Mir Jumta, the waxir
of Golkonda.

1650] MIR JUMLA CONQUERS KARNATAK 33

Muhammad Said, known to history as Mir Jumia, was a
Sayyid of Ardistan in Persia, and the son of an oil-merchant
of Isfahan. Leaving his native country in youth, he like
other Shia adventurers, sought his fortune at the Courts of
the Deccani Sultans who belonged fo his sect, (14630), As
a diamond merchant he rose to great wealth by his shrewd-
ness and business capacity. His wonderful talents gained him
the favour of Abdullah Qutb Shah, who made him his
prime minister, Mir Jumla’s industry, rapid despatch of business,
administrative capacity, military genius, and inborn power of
leadership ensured his success in all that he undertook. Great
alike in civil government and in war, he soon became the
virtual ruler of Golkonda: nothing could reach the Sultan
save with his approval. Sent by his master to the Karnatak,
he soon effected a complete transformation there. Mir Jumla
strengthened himself by securing a number of European
gunners and cannon-founders, raised his army to a high state
of discipline and efficiency, anc soon wrested the Cuddapa
district. His crowning feat was the capture of the rock-fortress
of Gandikota, hitherto deemed impregnable. Sidhout,” east
of Cuddapa, was also conquered, and his captains penetrated
as far as Chandragiri and Titupati in the North Arcot district.
By looting the rich old temples of the South and hunting out
buried treasure, Mir Jumia amassed a vast fortune, till he
came to be known as the tichest private man in the South
and the owner of twenty maunds of diamonds, By _ his
conquesis he raised his fagir in the Karnatak into a kingdom
300 miles long and 50 miles broad, yielding a revenue of 40
lakhs a year, and possessing several diamond mines. Thus
he had made himself fully independent of his master and the
virtual king of the Karnatak. Envious courtiers were nol
wanting to whisper to the, Sultan of Golkonda that the absent

wastr’s armed strength was a menace to his own security,
and that the servant's wealth overshadowed the grandeur of
the master's Court. Qutb Shah, too, naturally wished to have
a share of his waxie's gains in the Karnatak. Mir Jumla, on
the other hand, knowing how weak and worthless his master
was, regarded the conquest as entirely his own work and
was loth to return to the life of a courtier. Qutb Shah at
last openly undertook to crush his disobedient servant.

§8 8 Qutb Shaf’s rupture with the Mughals, 1655.

Mir Jumla now looked around for a protector. In addition
to making offers of his services to Bijapur, he began to
coquet with the Mughal power. Aurangzib secretly nursing
his passionate ambition of conquering the rich State of
Golkonda, was eager fo secure such an able helper and
counsellar as the prime minister of that kingdom. Through
the Mughal envoy at Golkonda the prince opened a_ secret
correspondence with Mir Jumla, promising him boundless
favours from the Emperor, if he joined the Mughal service,
But Mir Jumla wasin no haste fo accept the offer ; he asked
for a year’s time, and Aurangeib was discusted with his
duplicity.

Before Qutb Shah could muster either his courage or his
forces for the purpose of chastising Mir Jumla, a crisis was
precipitated by the conduct of Muhammad Amin, the wazir's
son. This young man, haughty and reckless, was acting all
these years as Mir Jumla’s deputy at the Court of Golkonda,
and used fo treat the Sulfan with scant courtesy in open
Court. Al last, one day Muhammad Amin came to Court
reeling with drunkenness, fell asleep on the Ring’s own carpel,
and soiled it in crop sickness. The long-suffering king’s anger
boiled over, and he threw Muhammad Amin and his family
info prison and attached their property (@ist November 1655).

1655] QUTB SHAH ARRESTS MIR JUMLA’S SON 35

This was the opportunity for which Aurangzib had so long
been waiting.

Aurangzib had received on [8th December the Emperor's
letiers appointing Mir Jumla and his son to the Mughal service
and bidding Qutb Shah not to hinder them in coming to the
imperial Court nor to detain their property, Ue immediately
sent the order to Quib Shah threatening him with war if he
delayed or disobeyed. In the meantime he mobilized his troops
on the Golkonda frontier. Qutb Shah seemed to have been
blind to the coming storm, he disregarded these Mughal letters.

On hearing (4th December) of Muhammad Amin’s captivity,
Shah Jahan wrote a letter to Qutb Shah to release Mir Jumla’s
family. He felt sure that his letter alone would effect the
purpose, But “in order to gratify Auranezib,” he rather
reluctantly sanctioned (29th Dec.) the invasion of Golkonda, in
case Muhammad Amin was still detained. Both these letters
reached Aurangzib on 7th January, 1656. He now employed
finesse to ruin Goikonda. Without giving Qutb Shah time to
receive and follow Shah Jahan’s letter of 24th December, which
explicitly ordered the release of the captives, he declared that
the king’s refusal to set them free in spite of the Emperor's
letter of Srd December amounted to that flat disobeclience of
imperial orders which had been laid down as a necessary
condition for the invasion of Golkonda,

At once, by order of Aurangzib, his eldest son Muhammad
‘Sultan crossed the frontier at Nander (40th January, 1656) and
made a dash on Haidarabad with his cavalry. On the 20th
of the month, Aurangzib himself started from Aurangabad and
hastened to join his son.

Meantime, after Muhammad Sultan had entered his territory,
Abdullah got Shah Jahan’s stern letter of 24th December and

at once sent Muhammad Amin with his family and servants

56 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB {cH II

to that prince, together with a humble letter of submission to
the Emperor. But Aurangzib had so contrived it that his  sub-
mission should come too late io save him. Muhammad Amin
waited on the prince, 24 miles from Haidarabad (probably on
Qist Jan), but the prince refused to stop hostilities and pressed
on to the capital on the plea that Abduflah had not yet
restored the property of the captives. Qutb Shah’s last hope
was gone; the Mughal cavalry had arrived so fast that he
had been completely taken by surprise. Confronted with utter
ruin, he fled from Haidarabad to the forl of Golkonda in the
night of 22nd January, abandoning his capital.

This Sight saved his life because Aurangzib’s secret insiruc~
tions to M. Sultan breathed deadly animosity :

“QOutb-ul-mulk is a coward and will probably offer no resistance Immediately on
delivering this message, altack him impetuously and, if you can manage it, MgAlen
Kis neck of tie burden of Ais Read, The best means of achieving this plan are
cleverness, promptitude, and lightness of hand.”

On 23rd January the invaders arrived at the Husain Sagar
tank, two miles north of Haidarabad. Confusion reigned in
the counsels of Golkonda. Next day the young prince entered
Haidarabad. A strong party was posted in the city uncer
Muhammad Beg to prevent plunder and violence. *Haidarabad
was one of the richest cities of India. This looting of Haidara-
bad by the Mughal army was the talk of all India in that age.
As Aurangzib's equerry, Agil Khan Razi, wrote in his history,
“Most of the stores and property of Qutb-ul-mulk, such as
precious books and other costly things beyond computation,
were plundered by Prince M. Sultan...Much of Qutb-ul-mulk’s
property,—among the rarities of the age,-was confiscated by
Aurangzib.”

Aurangzib arrived on the scene on Gth February with the
bulk of his army. With the vigour and promptitude that
marked all his actions, he first made a reconnaissance
of the fort of Golkonda and its environs.

1656] BURANGZIB INVADES GOLKONDA 37

Next day the siege of Golkonda began. The west side
was unoccupied, but Mughal officers entrenched on the other
three sides. The Jeaguer of Golkonda fasted from 7th
February fo 30th March, and was conducted very languidly,
because, with the materials at his disposal, he could do no
injury fo such an impregnable fortress. Battles took place
with the Golkonda troops hovering round, These skirmishes
were varied by the almost daily arrival of presents and offers
of peace from the beleaguered king to the invader’s camp !
But Aurangzib steadily refused to make terms. He coveted
the whole kingdom and nothing less. He plied his father
with all sorts of arguments {fo secure his consent to its
annexation. But Shah Jahan was Joth to ruin a brother king
for merely trying to bring his disloyal wosir under discipline.
Dara, who had been bribed and implored by the Golkonda
envoy at Delhi,—to the intense disgust and anger of Aurangzib,—
pleaded hard for Qutb-ul-mulk, and secured peace for him
on the payment of an indemnity. The Emperor's letter accept-
ing this settlement reached Aurangzib on 24th February.
Aurangzib suppressed the Emperor’s letter of pardon fo
QOuib-ul-mulk (dated 8th February), lest il should embolden the
latter and make him abate his terms.

In the meantime, Abdullah’s agent at the Court of Delhi
had bought the intercession of Dara Shukoh and of the
Princess Imperial Jahanara, [Guidasftal. Through them he
unfolded to the Emperor the fruc story of Aurangzib’s
manceuvring—how Abdullah had been tricked and almost
slain by treachery, how he had not been given a fair chance
of carrying out the Emperor's orders, how the imperial
farmang had been withheld from him, how Shah Jahan’s
kind intentions fowards the suppliant ruler had been thwarted.
At this Shah Jahan’s righteous indignation boiled over. He
wrote a sharp letter of censure to Aurangzib, with orders to
raise the siege and quit Golkonda territory a? once.

38 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cu Ff

So, on 30th March, in obedience to the Emperot’s peremp-
fory orders, Aurangzib raised the siege and withdrew from
the environs of Golkonda. Four days afterwards Muhammad
Sultan was married by proxy to the second daughter of
Abdullah Qutb Shah. The king of Golkonda, besides paying
a war indemnity and arrears of tribute amounting to one
krore of Rupees, had to cede the district of Ramgir (modern
Manikdrug anc Chinoor). The Mughal army set out on its
retreat on Qist April.

Mir Jumla had come to Aurangzib’s camp at Golkonda
on 90th March more as a prince than as a noble. Six thou-
sand. cavalry, 15,000 infantry, 1350 elephants, and a very good
train of artillery .accompanied him. Summoned immediately
fo the imperial Court, he arrived at Delhi on 7th July and
presented the Emperor with articles worth 15  /akés, including
a big diamond weighing 216 ratis. He was at. once created
a Commander of Six Thousand and appointed’ prime minister
in the place’ of Sadullah Khan lately deceased.

presents received from Golkonda had, he said, been
exagegeraled into “chest-loads of jewels” by malicious reporters
at the imperial Court.

Deace had been made with Golkonda, but one subject of
discord remained open. Qutb Shah wanted to keep the
Karnatak, and with justice ; it had been won by his servant
and formed part of his kingdom. But Aurangzib objected,
saying that it was Mir Jumla’s personal jagie and referred
the matier to the Emperor, who decided to hold the Karnatak
in his own hands as Mir Jumla’s jagir, and Qutb Shah was
ordered to recall his officers from that province. But the
Golkonda officers were loth to yield the rich prey. They
lingered there and threw every difficulty in the path of the
Mughals in occupying and settling the country,

§ it. . Autangzié invades Bijapur, 1657.

In the “feign of Muhammad Adil Shah (1696—46) the
kingdom of Bijapur attained to its highest extent, power, and
magnificence. His dominion stretched from the Arabian Sea
to the Bay of Bengal, across the entire Indian Peninsula.
Bver since 1636, Muhammad Adil Shah had lived at peace
with the Emperor of Delhi, and we read of friendly exchanges
of presents between: the two Courts. ‘his Sultan’s good
name for piety, love of justice, and care for his subjects,—
which was heightened by a certain simplicity of understanding
and ignorance of the world—gsreatly pleased Shah Jahan.
Mir Jumla’s arrival at Delhi (7ih July, 1656) secured the
triumph of Aurangzib’s policy of aggression in the Emperor's
council, With Mir Jumla dominating the Emperor's counsels
Aurangzib confidently matured the plan of invading Bijapur
on the expecied death of its reigning king.

On 4th November, 1656, Muhammad Adil Shah, the
seventh of the royal line of Bijapur, died. Through the efforts of
his chief minister Shan Muhammad and the Queen Bari Sahiba,

the crown was placed on the head of Ali Adil Shah I, a
youth of 18 years, and the only son of the late king.
Auranyzib immediately wrote to Shah Jahan, urging an invasion
on the plea that Ali was not really a son of ihe deceased
Sultan, but a boy of obscure parentage whom Muhammad
Adil Shah had brought up in the harem. The death of
Muhammad Adil Shah was followed by disorder in the
Karnatak ; the samindars recovered much to their former
lands. At the capital things were even worse. The Bijaputi
nobles quarrelled with one another and with the prime
minister Khan Muhammad for the division of power. To
aggravate the evil, Aurangzib intrigued with them, and
succeeded in corrupting several leading men of the Court
who promised their adhesion and prepared to desert to the
Mughal territory with their troops. Aurangzib hoped to
seduce the ofhers with the aid of Mir Jumla.

On 26th November, Shah Jahan sanctioned the invasion
and gave Aurangzib a free hand to “settle the affair of
Bijapur in any way he thought fit” A force of 20,000
iroopers, partly from the Court and partly from the jagitrs,
with a large staff of officers and Mir Jumla himself was
despatched to reinforce the army of Aurangzib. The war
thus sanctioned was wholly unrighteous. Bijapur was not a
vassal State, but an independent and equal ally of the
Mughal Emperor, and the fatler had no fawful right to confirm
or question the succession at Bijapur. Mir Jumla  arrivect at
Aurangabad on 18th January, and that very day at the
auspicious hour chosen by the astrologers, the prince sel out
with him to invade Bijapur. On 28th February, he reached
the environs of Bidar, and laid siege fo the fort on @nd
March. Siddi Marjan offered a stout defence: he made
several sorties, and falling on the trenches tried to arrest the
progress of the siege. But the superior numbers of the
Maghals told in the end, and Mir Jumla’s fine train of artillery

dic great damage to the fort walls; two towers were demo-
lished and the battlements of the lower-most wall as well as
ihe outer breast-works were levelled to the ground.

The ditch having been filled up, the assault was delivered
on 29th March. A spark from a rocket fired by the
Mughals fell into a chamber of sunpowder and grenades
behind the tower. There was a terrific explosion. Marjan
was mortally wounded with two of his sons and many of
his followers ; the exulting Mughals swarmed out of their
trenches and rushed into the city, driving the remnant of the
defenders back with fearful slaughter. Siddi Marjan from his
death-bed sent his seven sons to Aurangzib with the keys of
the fort..Thus, the stronghold of Bidar fell after a siege of 97
days only. Among the spoils of victory were 12 /eéAs of
Rupees in cash, 8 lakhs worth of powder, shot, grain and
other stores, besides 230 pieces of cannon.

Aurangzib next sent a force of 15,000 well mounted and
experienced troopers under Mahabat Khan, {1o punish the
assembled enemy and ravage the Bijapur territory up to
Kaliani in the west and Kulbarga in the south. This Mughal
detachment encountered the enemy on {2th April. The
Bijapuris, numbering some 20,000, under their famous chiefs
Khan Muhammad, Afeal Khan, anc the sons of Randaulah
and Raihan, began the attack. Mahbabat Khan Sike a good
general kept his men well in hand, amidst the ring of his
enemies and their distracting mode of attack; finally he
charged and the Bijapuris fled.

Forty miles west of Bidar, on the old road from the holy
shrine of Tuljapur to Golkonda, stands the city of Katiani,
the ancient capital of the Chalukya kings anc of the Kanarese
country. Aurangziob on @7ih April set out with light bit and
arrived before Kaliani in a week’s time. The place was
immediately invested. Day and night the garrison kept up a
ceaseless fire from ihe walls ; they made flerce onslaughts on

Mir Jumla’s trenches, but to no purpose, Once Mahabat
Khan himself on escort duty was hemmed round by the
enemy at a place 1/0 miles north-east of Kaliani. The battle
raged long and fiercely, The brunt of the battle feil on the
Rajputs. The horsemen of Khan Muhammad burst in vain upon
the granite wall of Rao Chhatra Sal and his Hada clansmen.
Rajah Rai Singh Sisodia, assaulted by the sons of Bahlol
Khan of Bijapur, was wounded and unhorsed in the press
of the enemy. Just then relief arrived: a charge by
Mahabat Khan broke the enemy’s ranks and they fled.

While Aurangzib concentrated his efforts on pressing the
siege hard, a Bijapuri army 30,000 strong assembled only
four miles from his camp. On 28th May, leaving a screen
of tents round the fort, the prince marched with the main
body of his troops upon the enemy's position. All divisions
of the two armies were engaged with their respective opponents.
The fight raged for six hours, The Deccanis kept up a
running fight; four times in succession were they broken
and as often did they form again and face the advancing
Mughals. But at last the repeated charges of the heavily
armed northern horsemen prevailed in the close fight; the
Mughal army crowded upon the enemy from left and right
and scatiered them finally; the imperialists pursued them pell-
mell to their camp, slaying and capturing ali that they could.
Everything found in the Bijapuri camp,—arnis,  slave-girls,
horses, iransport-catfle, and al! kinds of property,—~vas
plundered. The siese was pressed with vigour, but the
defence by the Abyssinian Dilawwar was equally heroic. The
Bijapuris began to assemble again in order to oppose the
Mughals. So, on 22nd July, Aurangsib sent a large division
under his eldest son and Mir Jumia to break up their forces. This
Mughal corps advanced forty-eight miles, charged and broke
their formation, and pursued them for four miles. The victors
proceeded, laying the Bijapuri villages waste, up to Kulbarga,

1657] PEACE WITH ADIL SHAUL 43

On 29th July, the imperialists scaled a tower on the other
side of the moat of Kaliani. The strugele here was most
obstinate. But the assailants swarmed inio the fort and held
this portion of the defences. On ist August the keys of the
fort were delivered up by Dilawwar, who was given a
robe of honour with permission to go to Bijapur.

After the fall of Kaliani, the king of Bijapur opened
negotiations for peace. Bijapuri agents intrigued at Delhi and
secured the intercession of Dara with the Emperor. It was
agreed that Adil Shah would cede to the Mughals the forts
of Bidar, Kaliant and Parenda with their dependent territories,
as well as a war-indemnity of one f&rote of Rupees. On
these terms Shah Jahan ordered Aurangzib to make peace
and to return with his avmy to Bidar, while the reinforcements
sent to the Deccan from Malwa and Northern India were
recalled io their former posts. Thus Awurangzib received a
sharp check in the hour of his triumph ; he had gained only
the northern fringe of the vast Bijapur kingdom when his
father cried halt to him. The Bijapuris profited by his distrac-
tion and weakened power and delayed and finally refused
to surrender Parenda.

To complete the misfortunes of the Mughal cause in the
Deccan, Shah Jahan fell iif on Gth September and rumours
of his death spread through the empire. Aurangzib, harassed
by anxiety and distracted by conflicting plans, began his
retreat from Kaliani on 4th October, 1657.

CHAPTER I

ILLNESS OF SHAH JAHAN AND REBELLION
OF HIS SONS.

8 1. Sfaf jJahan’s eldest son Dara Shukoh,

‘ On 7th March, 1657, Shah Jahan completed three decades
of his reign and began the Sist year. The reign had been
as prosperous as it had been Jong. The ‘wealth of Ind’:
under this Great Mughal dazzled the eves of foreign visitors,
and on gala days ambassadors from Bukhara and Dersia,
Turkey and Arabia, as well as travellers from France and
aly, gazed with wonder at the Peacock Throne and the
Kohinur and other jewels. The white marble edifices which
he loved to build were “as costly as they were chaste in
design. The nobles of the empire eclipsed the kings of
other Jands in wealth and pomp. The bounds - of the “pro-
fected empire” had been stretched farther than in any
preceding reign. Within the country itself a profound peace
reigned. The peasantry were carefully cherished ; harsh and
exacting governors were in many cases dismissed on the
complaint of the people. Wealth and prosperity increased
on all hands. A kind and yet wise master, Shah Jahan had
gathered round himself a band of very able officers, and
made his Court the centre of the wit and wisdom of the
land. But one by one the great ministers and generals who
had contribuied io the glory of fhe reign were being removed
by the pitiless hand of Death. And, as the gianfs of old
passed avay, the Emperor found no worthy successors to

What would happen after him 9

Shah Jahan had four sons. All of them were past youth,
and all had gained experience as governors of provinces and
commanders of armies. But there was no brotherly love
among them. The _ ill-feeling between Dara and Aurangzib
in particular was so bitter and had continued growing  bitlerer
for so many years past, that it was the talk of the whole
empire, and peace had been maintained between them only
by keeping Aurangzib far away from the Court and his
eldest brother. Shah Jahan had given clear indications that
he wished to leave the crown to Dara, the eldest of his four
sons by the same mother. In order fo train him in the
administration of the empire and to smooth the transfer of
the supreme authority to him, the Emperor had kept Dara
by his side for many years past, and allowed him to
govern his vicerovalties by deputies. At the same time the
Emperor bestowed on him rank and privileges which raised him
to an almost royal position. All had to buy or beg Dara’s
mediation before they could approach the Emperor.

Dara was just turned of forty-two years. He had taken
affer his great-grandfather Akbar. In his thirst for pantheistic
philosophy he had studied the Talmud and the New Testament,
the writings of the Muslim Sufis, and the Hindu Vedanta.
lis aim was to find a meeting-point tor Hinduism and kblam
in those universal truths which form the common basis of all
true religions and which fanatics are too apt to ignore in
their geal for the mere externals of faith. Alike from the
Hindu yogi Lal-dds and the Muslim fogir Sarmad, he had im-
bibed his eclectic philosophy, and at the feet of both he had
sat as an attentive pupil, But he was no apostate from
Islam. He had compiled a biography of Muslim saints, and
he had been initiated as a disciple of (he Muslim saint Mian

Mir, which no gafir could have been. The saintly Jahanara
also speaks of Dara as her spiritual preceptor. Dara’s own
words in introducing to the reader his theological works
clearly prove that he never discarded the essential dogmas of
Islam; he only displayed the eclecticism of the Sufis, a
recognized school of Islamic believers. However, his coquetry
«vith Hindu philosophy made it imvossible for him, even if he
had the inclination, to pose as the champion of orthodox and
exclusive Islam, or lo summon all Muslims to his banners
by proclaiming a holy war against the people beyond the
fold of the faith.

His father’s excessive love did him a distinct harm. He
was always kept at Court and never, except at the third
siege ot Qandahar, sent to conducl campaigns or administer
proyinees. Thus, be never acquired experience in the arts of
war and government ; he never learnt to judge men by the
crucial test of danger and difficulty ; and he lost touch with
the active army. Hence, he was rendered unfit for that war of
uecession which among the Mughals served as a practical test

eit of war was destined to meet a practised veteran as his
rival for the throne.

8 2. lilness cf Shab jahan, 1657, and consequent
disorder in tfe empttre,

On 6th September, Shah Jahan suddenly fell ill of stransury
and constipation at Delhi. For one week the royal physicians
toiled in vain. The malady went on increasing, The daily
darbat was stopped ; the Emperor even ceased to show his
face to the public from the balcony. Aflerf a week the
doctors ai last got control over the malady. But the improye-
ment in the Emperor’s condition was slight, and so he decided
io go to Agra and die there quietly in sight of the tomb of
ihe wife he had loved so well. He enterecdl Agra city on
%6lh October.

During Shah Jahan’s illness Dara conslantly watched by his
bed-side, and tended and nursed him most carefully, and
showed no indecent haste to secure the crown for himself.
Early in the course of his illness, when Shah Jahan despaired
of recovery, he set himself to prepare for the next world.
Calling to his presence some confidential ‘courtiers and the
chief officers of ithe State, he made his last will before them
and ordered them to obey Dara henceforth as their sovereign.
Dara, however, did not assume the crown, but continued to
issue orders in his father’s name, while attempting to strengthen
his own position. lle removed Mir Jumla, the confidant and
partisan of Aurangzib, from the wazir-ship (end of September)
and sent orders to Mir Jumla, Mahabat Khan and other
imperial officers to return fram the Deccan to the Court with
iheir contingents.

48 SHOR’ HISTORY OF AURANGZIB lca. JH

By the middle of November Shah Jahan had recovered
sufficiently to be told of important matters which had hitherto
been kept from him. One was that Shuja had crowned
himself and was advancing from Bengal. With Shah Jahan’s
consent an army, 29,000 strong, was sent against him (30th
November) under Sulaiman Shukoh (the eldest son of Dara)
and Mirza Rajah Jai Singh. Soon afterwards equally alarming
news arrived from Gujrat. There Murad had crowned
himself on Sth December, and formed an alliance with
Aurangzib. So, about the end of this month two imperial
armies were despaiched from Agra into Malwa—one to
oppose the advance of Aurangzib from the South and the
other to march into Gujrat and oust Murad from the province.
The first of these armies was placed under Maharajah Jaswant
Singh (of Marwar), who was appointed governor of Malwa
vice Shaista Khan recalled to Court. Qasim Khan was induced
to aceept the command of the second army by being created
governor of Gujrat. Shah Jahan besought these generals to
spare the fives of his younger sons, to try at first to send
them back to their provinces by fair words if possible, other-
wise by a demonstration of force, and not, except in extreme
need, to resort fo a deadly battle.

During Shah Jahan’s illness Dara at firstallowed none but one
or two ministers in his confidence to have access to the
Emperor. He also waiched the Serries and stopped all letters
and messengers going to his brothers in Bengal, Gujrat and
the Deccan, and kept their agents at the imperial Court
under watch lest they should send any report to their masters.
But these precautions only wrought greater mischief, The
; princes and people in the disiant provinces nalurally concluded

from this stoppage of news that Shah Jahan was dead,
and all the confusion and disorder of a Mughal succession
broke out. Everywhere lawless men began to cause turnults,
ihe peasants refused to pay the revenue, the zamindars tried


--- Page 56 ---
1657] MURAD IN GURAT 49

to rob or conquer their rivals, and the frontiers were violated.
The focal authorities were paralysed by uncertainty and anxiety
about the future, and law and order suddenly disappeared in
many places.

No doubt, letters in Shah jJahan’s hand and seal
reached the princes assuring them of his recovery, but they
maintained that these were really written by Dara, an expert
imitator of Shah Jahan’s handwriting, and that the late Emperor's
seal was necessarily in the pogsession of the usurper !
The three younger brothers, therefore, very plausibly asserted
in their letters to the Emperor that their loving minds had
been unsettled by these alarming rumours, and they were
marching on Agra to see their father with their own eves and
satisfy themselves as to his real condition.

§ 3. DMurad Bakfsi crowns fimself in Guyrat.

Muhammad Murad Bakhsh, the youngest son of Shah Jahan,
was the black sheep of the imperial family. He had been
tried in Balkh, the Deccan, and Gujrat, and he had failed
everywhere. A foolish, pleasure-loving and impetuous prince,
his character had not improved with age ; he had nol learnt
to apply himself to business or to bridle his passions. Worse
sill, he had not the gift of choosing capable agents. But
Murad possessed the reckless valour of a soldier. Place him
in the field of combat, and the martial spirit of Timur would
fire his blood, he would resistlessly force his way to close
gtips with the enemy, and, amidst the carnage raging round
him, forget every other feeling save the fierce delight of
slaughter, But his personal valour was a poor compensation
for his lack of generalship.

Knowing the prince’s incapacity, Shah jahan had _ tried
to remedy the mischief by sending to him a_ very capable
and honest officer named Ali Naqi as his revenue minister

4


--- Page 57 ---
50 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cu. HT

and chief counsellor. Ali Naqi’s pure and vigilant
administration raised against him a host of enemies among
the flatterers and boon companions of the prince. A
conspiracy was soon formed by Murad’s favourite’eunuch against
the hated minister. A letter fn Ali Naqi’s hand and seal,
professing achesion io the cause of Dara, was forged and
given to a courier, who contrived to get himself arrested
by Murad’s road patrol, without betraying its real authorship.
Murad was revelling in his pleasure-garden when the intercept-
ed letter was brought to him a litte before dawn. The prince,
who had not slept off his night's debauch, burst into wrath
and ordered Ali Naqi to be dragged to his presence. Quiver-
ing with pent-up wrath, he ran Ali Naqi through with his
spear, shouting, “Wretch ! in spite of all my favours you have
turned such a traitor !”

Murad was enlisting troops in large numbers and needed
money badly. So he sent an eunuch named Shahbaz Khan
with 6,000 troopers and war material to levy contribution from
the rich port of Surat. The unwalled city was easily occupied
and looted. Under the guidance of some Dutch artificers
Shahbaz Khan ran mines under the wall of the fort of Surat,
and by exploding one ‘of them forced the place to surrender
(20th December). Murad thus gained all the guns and accu-
mulated treasures of Surat, besides iaking a forced loan of
five /akfis of Rupees from two of the richest merchants.

In the meantime, soon after receiving the news of Shah
Jahan’s serious illness, Murad and Aurangzib had opened a
confidential correspondence with each other by means of trusty
messengers. They also wrote to Shuja inviting his co-operation
against Dara, but the long distance prevented their forming
any definite or working agreement. Between Murad and
Aurangzib, however, a plan of concerted action was soon
matured, From the very beginning Murad placed himself under
Aurangzib’s guidance, But he was too impetuous. After his


--- Page 58 ---
1658} MURAD’S TREATY WITH AURANGZIB 51

success at Surat, he publicly crowned himself as Emperor under
the title of Maruwwaj-ud-din (th December). In letter after
letter we find Murad all fire and haste, while Auranggib is
cold and hesilating.

Murad proposed that ithe brothers should march at once
from the South and attack Dara before he had time fo con-
solidale his power and to win over the capiains of the imperial
army posted far and near. Aurangzib pressed him not to take
any compromising step or sef up the banner of revolt openly,
but to wait, to dissimulate, and to send hollow friendly letters
to Dara, till they should know for certain that Shah Jahan was
dead. Aurangzib had suggested to Murad that a diversion
should be made against Dara by instigating the Persians and
Uzgbaks to invade Afghanistan, which was then a province of
the Mughal empire. Murad, therefore, wrote to the king of
Persia reporting the rumour of Shah Jahan’s death and begging
armed aid from him. The fatier wanted fo wait and verify the
news.

A solemn treaty for the partilion of the empire on the
following terms was drawn up by Aurangzib, sworn to
on the Quran, and sent to Murad :

() Murad was to hold the Panjab, Afghanistan, Kashmir
and Sindh and reign over them as an independent king. The
rest of the Mughal dominions was to belong to Aurangzib.

Gi) One-third ot the prize of war was to belong to Murad
and two-thirds to Aurangzib.”

His preparations being now complete, Murad set out from
Ahmadabad on 25th February 1658 and effected a junction
with Aurangzib’s forces at Dipalpar in Malwa on {4th April.

* These terms are clealy given in Awrangzib’s own letter: (Adab-i-Alamari, p. 78),
his officer Aqil Khan Rasi’s history (p, 25), and the Taskivat-us-salatin-us~cagntaia,
thus refuting Bernier’s absurd story that Aurangzib promised to give ihe entire empire
to Murad while he himself would go lo Mecca as a datvish (Hazralji) after over-
throwing the infidel Dara.

39 SHORT HISIORY OF AURANGZIB (cu. Ill

4 4, Aurangsib’s anxieties and policy on the eve of the
War of Succession.

From 4th October 1657, when Aurangzib retired from
the war with Bijapur, to 23th January 1658, when he began
his march towards Hindustan as a claimant to the throne, he
passed through a most anxious and critical time Events
which he could nof possibly control were moving fast. *

His present position was daily growing more untenable,
while the future was ominous, But the difficulties, great and
complex, which he overcame raise to the highest pitch our
admiration for his coolness, sagacity, power of managing men,
and diplomatic skill.

The news had got out that the Emperor had ordered peace to
be made and recalled the additional troops sent to the Deccan’,
Thus a cruel fate threatened to snatch away from‘ Aurangzib’s
grasp the fruits of his long and costly war with Bijapur, just
when he was about to taste them. Aurangzib, therefore, deter-
mined lo play a game of boldness in order to realize the terms
of the treaty before the Bijapuris could recover from their
recent defeats or learn of the full extent of the weakness and
distraction of the imperial Government.

But this policy of facing round to Bijapur and making
military demonstrations in the South had its drawbacks too, The
longer Aurangzib delayed in maturing his plans for contesting
the throne, proclaiming himself a claimant, and marching on
Hindustan, the greater was the time that Dara would gain for
recalling the chiet captains from the Deccati, winning over
officers and men far and near, consolidating his own power,
and offectually cotinieracting Aurangzib’s possible designs. If,
on the other hand, Aurangzib concentrated his forces, made a
public claim to the throne, marched northwards and openly*>~
broke with the imperial Government by enlisting {roops,——then
he would, no doubt, check Dara in time, he would secure (he

adhesion of ambitious adventurers. But at the same tine all
hope of getting Parenda or the promised indemnity would be
gone, and his other enemies in the South would raise their
heads ; the fruits of the last lwo years’ warfare in the Deccan
would be totally lost to him.

Aurangzib’s letters, preserved in the Adab-~/-Alamgirt, tell
the story of how the hope of a speedy setilement with
Bijapur daily grew fainter and fainter, how he tried diverse
means to get the promised territory and money, how he
conceded to Bijapur one by one the hard terms wrung out of
it by the treaty,—till at last, in despair of getting anything
from Bijapur, he gave up all thought of the South, and turned
his undivided attention and resources to the pursuit of his
schemes in Northern India.

Leaving Kaliani on 4th October 1657, Aurangsib reached
Bidar in five days, This fort was repaired and properly
garrisoned and provisioned. On the 18th of the month he
resumed his retreat march and arrived at Aurangabad on the
1ith November. As soon as he left Bidar, there was the greatest
rejoicing in the Deccani kingdoms; here were the Mughals
abandoning their late conquests as untenable | He had sent
Mir Jumia to the Parenda district (@8th Sept) to get delivery
of that fort in terms of the treaty. Bul the hope of getting
Parenda and the Bijapur indemnity grew fainter and fainter,
in spite of all the efforts of Mir Jumla, and at last that general
returned baffled to Aurangabad (1st January 1658).

As early as 28th October Aurangzib had taken a very
necessary precaution by sencing a force to seize all the ferries
of the Narmada and prevent correspondence between Dara
and the imperial officers in the Deccan. But what line of
action was he to adopt now ? His followers were looking up
to him to declare his policy, but a decision at this stage was
most difficult to make and beset with daggers. The news from
the imperial Court was conflicting, Shah Jahan’s exact condition


--- Page 61 ---
3-f SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cu HE

could not be known with certainty, and for many weeks
Aurangzib lived in the greatest distraction ; and so did his
followers.

Aurangzib had from the first decided not to raise the
banner of rebellion before knowing for certain that Shah Jahan
was dead. But the quick march of events forced his hand.
Dara’s plan with regard to the South’ was now fully unfolded :
he had induced the helpless Shah Jahan to remove Murad from
the viceroyalty of Gujrat and to transfer the subaf of Berar
from Aurangzib to Murad, so as to make the two brothers
quarrel. Further, Dara had sent two armies against his two
brothers in ihe South (close of December) and recalled Shaista
Khan (a strong supporter of Aurangzib) from his province of
Malwa to the Court, while Mir Jumla now received an
imperial letter of recall from Aurangzib’s side which it would
have been flat rebellion to disregard. Similar letters reached
Aurangzib’s officers

§ 5. Aurangszib’s preparations for contesting the [frone.

The time for action had at last arrived, if Aurangzib hoped
ever to be king or even to live in freedom. His mind was
made up early in January 1658, and he took rapid and
decisive steps. First, Mir Jumla was atrested by collusion with
him, lodged in mock captivity in Daulatabad fort, and all his
property and excellent artillery seized by Aurangzib in the
name of the State. The prince gave out as the ostensible
reason for this act, that Mir Jumla was in secret intrigue with

the two Deccani Sultans against the Emperor! He next wrote .

to Shah Jahan and the new waxir Jafar Khan to the effect
that his loving heart had been distracted | by hearing sad
rumours about Shah Jahan, and that like a dutiful son he was

going to Agra to see his father in his illness, release him from:

Dara’s control, and thereby save the empire from alarm,
confusion and. tumult

2 he

Lory

Letters were written to Qutb Shah pressing him to pay up
the balance of his war indemnity, and the Mughal envoy at
the Golkonda Court was ordered to behave gently to that
Ring, and to induce him to do nothing unfriendly to
the Mughal interests during Aurangzib’s proposed absence
from the Deccan. Friendly epistles and presents were sent
to the Queen Mother (Bari Sahiba) of Bijapur, urging
her to expedite the payment of the promised money and
to keep the Bijapuris quiet during his absence, Still later,
a very tempting offer was made to Adil Shah by Aurangzib,
as the price of his friendliness: “Remain loyal and keep
your promises... 1 agree that (1) the fort of Parenda and
its dependent territory, the Konkan, and the mafal of Wangi,
which have been annexed to the empire, together with
that portion of the Karnatak which had been granted to the late
Adil Shah,—should be left to you as before, and (2) out of
your promised indemnity of one &rore of Rupees, thirty lakhs
ate remitted. Protect this country ; improve its aciministration.
Expel Shiva who has sneaked into the possession of some forts
of the land. Do you send me at least 10,000 cavalry. I shall
grant you all the territorry up to the bank of the Banganga.”

All this time Aurangzib was intriguing actively but in secret
with the courtiers of the capital and the high officers in the
provinces (especially Malwa). Of all the four sons of Shak
Jahan he had the best reputation for capacity and experience,
All selfseeking nobles and officers recognized him as the
coming man, and hastened to secure their future by doing him
friendly turns, or at least by sending him secret assurances of
their support |

The enlisting of new soldiers had been going on apace.
Large quantities of salipetre, sulphur and lead were bought
for making munitions, while the gunpowder and fuses in the
Deccan forts wete taken away for the advance on Delhi. In
this way Aurangsib’s army was swollen fo 30,000 picked


--- Page 63 ---
36 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cu IIE

troopers, besides Mir Jumla’s excellent train of cannon served
by English and French gunners.

Aurangzib was even stronger in officers than in men and
material. During his rule of the Deccan he had gathered
round himself a band of very able servants, all attached to him
by gratitude and some by personal affection. They did him
signal service during the contest tor the throne. Such were
Murshid Quli Khan, the dfwan, Shaikh Mir, the warrior and
confidential adviser, Agil Khan Razi, the equerry and personal
attendant, Qabil Khan, the facile and trusty secretary, Khan~
i-Zaman, the energetic Inspector of Ordnance, Muhammad Tahir,
a veteran caplain raised to tHe peerage as Wazir Khan, the
faithful envoy Isa Beg (created Mukhlis Khan), the highborn and
experienced Shams-ud-din Mukhtar Khan, and above all that
jewel of a servant, Mir Jumla, great in war, greater still in
counsel. Among his most devoted Hindu followers were Rao
Karan of Bikanir, Subh-Karan the Bundela (of Datia), and Rajah
Indramani of Dhamdhera.

Before leaving the Deccan Aurangzib took steps to maintain
his hold on the country during his absence. Prince Muazzam
was left at Aurangabad with two high officers and a strong
force to carry on the government,_ while Aurangzib’s harem
was placed in the neighbouring fort of Daulatabad.

At last, on Sth February 1658, Aurangzib started from
Aurangabad to contest the throne. Burhanpur was reached on
the 18th, and here a month’s halt was made in order to
complete the organization of his army and other preparations.
Leaving Burhanpur on 20th March, he arrested and put in
prison his father-in-law Shah Nawaz Khan, who persisted in his
loyalty to Shah Jahan (26th March), The Narmada was
crossed at Akbarpur, without the least opposition (3rd April),
and then while marching northwards to Ujjain, he learnt an the
13th, near Dipalpur (some 26 miles south of Ujjain), that
Murad had arrived a few miles west of him. Next day the

two brothers joined their forces near the lake ot Dipalpur,
laswant was only one day’s march in front of him. In the
evening the princes encamped at the village of Dharmat (14
miles s. 5. w. of Ujjain), on the western bank of the Gambhira,
an affluent of the Chambal river. Next day the great war of
Mughal Suceession began.

BOOK I.
CHAPTER IV
WAR OF SUCCESSION : AURANGZIB TRIUMPHS.
§ 1. Jaswant at Dhaemat ; his difficulties.

Reaching Ujjain with his army at the end of Pebruary
1658, Jaswant was quite in the dark about Aurangzib’s inten-
tions and movements, so. strictly did that prince watch the
roads and ferries of the Narmada river. The first news
that he got of Aurangzib was that the prince was already in
Mabwa and rapidly marching on Ujjain.

In utter perplexity Jaswant advanced fourteen miles south-west
of Ujiain and encamped opposite Dharmal, to block the path of
the enemy coming up from the south. Here another startling
news reached him: Murad had joined Aurangzib (14th April)
and the two were within a day’s march of him.

Jaswant had come ta Malwa in the hope that the mere
prestige of the imperial banners would send the rebellious
princes back to their provinces, and that all that he would
have to undertake was a mere demonstration of force. Now,
when too late, he realized that his adversaries were in deadly
earnest and ready to fight to the bitter end.

Jaswant was severely handicapped by Shah Jahan’s instruc-
tions to send the two rebellious princes back to their own
provinces with as little injury to them as possible, and to fight
them only as a last resource. While Aurangzib followed his
own judgment only, knew his own mind, Jaswant was hesitat-
ing, distracted by the conflict between the instructions from


--- Page 66 ---
1658] JASWANT'S DIFTICULTIES Af DIARMAT 49

Agra and the exigencies of the actual military situation in
Malwa, and entirely dependent for his own line of action on
what his opponents would do.

His army, too, was an ill-knit group of discordant elements.
The various Rajput clans were often divided from each other
by hereditary feuds and quarrels about dignity and precedence.
Then, again, there was the standing aloofness between Hindus
and Muhammadans. It had been found next to impossible to
brigade these creeds together for a campaign under one general,
There was no unity of command in the imperial army
assembled at Dharmat, because Qasim Khan's orders were to
co-operate with Jaswant and not to act as his subordinate.
Several of the Muslim officers, moreover, were secretly friendly
to Aurangzib ; for we find thatin the ensuing battle twenty-four
Rajput chiefs and only one Muhammadan general were killed
on the Emperor's side. Qasim Khan and his men kept
themselves out of harm’s way in the battle and the full brunt
of it fell on the Rajputs,

Finally, Jaswant as a general was no match for Aurangzib -
his faulty plan and conduct of the battle proves his inexpe-
rience and hot-headedness. He chose his ground badly and
so cramped his men that the horsemen could not manoauvre
freely nor gather momentum for a charge ; he failed to send
timely succour io the divisions that needed it most, and, the
battle once begun, he lost control over his forces as if he
were a mere divisional leader and not the supreme commander
of all, Lastly, he made the fatal mistake of despising artillery,

Evidently Jaswant’s plan was to skirt the enemy’s artillery
and come to close quarters with their troops, disregarding the
gun-fire during the first few minutes of the wild gallop. But
when the battle began, the Rajputs were penned within a
narrow space with ditches and entrenchments “on their flanks,
and subjected to a deadly fire before they could spread out
for a charge. Secondly, after they had passed by the enemy’s


--- Page 67 ---
rae) SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB (cr. IV

artillery and engaged Aurangzib’s troops, the French and
English gunners of the prince quickly turned their guns sideways
and began fo mow down the Rajputs in their new position.
It was truly a contest between swords and gunpowder, and
arlillery triumphed over cavalry.

§ 2, Battle of Dharma.

The two armies were almost equally matched and numbered
a little over 35,000 men each, though Aurangzib’s foree was
immensely superior in cohesion and artillery.

Two hours after sunrise on the 15th of April, the rival hosts
sighted each other. Aurangzib’s army advanced slowly upon
the imperialist position, keeping its regular formation, and
began to shoot down the Rajputs densely packed in columns
without space lo manceuvre freely. The Rajput losses began
fo mount up every minute. Then their vanguard, led by
Mukund Singh Hada, Ratan Singh Rathor, Dayal Singh Jhala,
Arjun Singh Gaur, Sujan Singh Sisodia and others, with their
choicest clansmen, galloped forward. Shouting their war-ery
of Ram / Ram /“they fell on the enemy like tigers, casting
away all plan.” The flood of Rajput charge first burst on
Aurangzib’s artillery. The guns and muskets fired at point
blank range, woefully thinned their ranks, but so impetuous
was their onset that it bore down all opposilion. Murshid Ouli
Khan, the Chief of Artillery, was slain after a heroic resistance
and his division was shaken; but the guns were not damaged,
The artillerymen probably fled before the storm, and returned as
soon as it passed away. Victorious over the artillery suard,
the assailants fell on the front part of Aurangzib’s vanguard:
Here an obstinate hand-to-hand combat raged for some time.
The Rajputs, flushed with success, swept onward and pierced
into the heart of Aurangzib’s vanguard, This was the most
critical moment of the day; if the Rajput charge were not
checked, all would be over with Aurangzib,


--- Page 68 ---
1658] BATTLE OF DHARMA’ él

But this front division of the prince’s army was composed
of his most picked troops, 8,000 mail-clad warriors, and their
gencrals were reliable men, who, seated on their elephants,
kept their ground firmly like hills while the flood of Rajput
charge raged round and round them in eddies. Here the most
stubborn and decisive fighting of the day took place, and “the
ground was dyed crimson with blood like a tulip bed.” The
force of Rajput impact was divided and weakened when it
struck the dense mass of Aurangzib’s vanguard.

Only a few men from Jaswant’s centre and advanced
reserve had moved up to support their brethren thus struggling
in front; the Mughal troops under Qasim Khan rendered no
assistance. Thus, the charge of Jaswant’s vanguard was not
followed up ; Aurangzib’s troops, who had parted before the
rushing tide, closed again behind them, and cut off their retreat.
By this time the watchful eve of Aurangzib had taken the
situation in, his advanced reserve had been pushed up to
reinforce the van, and he himself moved forward with the
centre to form a wall of support and refuge close behind
them. Above all, Shaikh Mir and Saf Shikan Khan with the
right and left wings of the centre struck the Rajputs in the waist
from the lwo flanks, while they were engaged with |Aurangzib’s
van in front. All the six Rajput chieftains, engaged in the charge
were slain. Hopelessly outnumbered now, assailed in front, right,
and left, and cut off from their rear, the Rajputs were slaughtered
after performing frantic deeds of valour.

Meantime, the action had become general. Recovering from
the shock of Mukund Singh’s charge as soon as the Rajput
cavalcade swept on to another point, Aurangzib’s gunners, with
their pieces mounted on high ground, concentrated their fire
on the enemy’s centre under Jaswant himself,

The imperialists, crowded together on a narrow ground
flanked with impassable ditches and swamps, could not
manoeuvre freely, and “sacrificed their lives like moths in the

a

flame of war.’ At the sight of the annihilation of their brave
vanguard and a triumphant forward movement on the part of
Aurangzib, Rai Singh Sisodia from the right flank of Jaswant’s
centre, and Sujan Singh Bundela and Amar Singh Chandrawat
from his van, left the field with their clansmen and returned
home.

Meantime, Murad Bakhsh with his division had fallen on
Jaswant’s camp, close ta the field, secured the submission of one
of its defenders, Devi Singh Bundela, and driven off the rest.
Then advancing into the field itself, Murad fell on the — left
wing of the imperial army, and it soon ceased to exisi, after
losing its commander iftighar Khan.

8 3. Flight of Jaswant and fis troops,

Rai Singh’s flight had already uncovered Jaswant’s right
flank ; the fall of [ftikhar Khan exposed his left. Meantime his
van had almost entirely melted away ; the Musalmans, under
Qasim Khan, who had Rept aloof from the fighting, prepared
to run away as they saw Aurangzib’s host advancing on them.
And now Aurangzib from the front, Murad from the left, and
Saf Shikan Khan from the right, were converging on  Jaswanl
fike a tumultuous flood, to envelop his small remnant of
clansmen. The Maharajah, who had received two wounds,
wanted to drive his horse into the advancing  enemy’s
ranks and get slain. But his generals and ministers seizect
his bridle and dragged his horse out of the field, and
took the road to Jodhpur. The battle had been already lost,
and after the flight of the Rathors there was a general rout.
But there was no pursuit ; victor and vanquished alike were
worn out by the strife, and there was a rich prize af hand.
The entire camp of the two imperial generals—with all their
artillery, tents, elephants and treasure, became the victorious
princes’ spoil, while their soldiers looted the baggage and
equipment of the vanquished army.


--- Page 70 ---
1658] AURANGZIB'S ADVANCr TROM DHARMAT 63

But far greater than all these material gains was the moral
prestige secured by Aurangzib. Dharmat became the omen
of his future success. At one blow he had brought Dara
down from a position of immense superiority to one of
equality with his own, or even lower. Waverers hesitated no
longer ; they now knew beyond a moment's doubt which of
the four brothers was the chosen favourite of Victory.

No sooner had Jaswant and Qasim Khan turned their backs
than Aurangzib’s band struck up the notes of victory :
Aurangzib Rnelt down on the feld and with folded arms
rendered thanks to the Giver of Victory.

On the imperial side nearly six thousand men fell in this battle,
and the main portion of the loss was borne by the Rajputs.
Every clan of Rajasthan contributed its share to the band of
heroes who sacrificed their Jjives in their master’s service
(swami-dfarma). To Ratan Singh Rathor (the progenitor of the
houses of Rutlam, Sailana and Sitamau) a noble stone monu-
ment was raised by his descendants on the spot where his
corpse was burnt.

8 4. Aurangzib advances to Agra.

The day after the victory the two princes reached Ujjain
and marching thence arrived at Gwalior on 2tst May. It was
here learnt that Dara had come to Dholpur with a vast army
and seized all the well-known and frequented fords over the
Chambal river. His entrenchments frowned on the crossing
places ; his artillery crowned the opposite bank ; and every-
where strong parties of his troops were on the alert for the
enemy’s atrival. To cross the river with its sleep rocky banks
and wide ravine-intersected approaches, in the face of
stich oppositon, would have led to a heavy loss of life.
So Aurangzib secured the help of a logal gamindar and learnt
“that, “at Bhadaoli, 40 miles east of Dholpur, there was an


--- Page 71 ---
64 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB fom IV

obscure ford with only knee-deep water, which Dara had
omitted to guard.

No time was to be lost. In the very evening after their arrival
near Gwalior (ist May), while the main army halted, a strong
division under three generals and some artillery made a forced
match all night, reached the ford next morning, and crossed
safely to the other bank. That day Aurangzib himself set out
from Gwalior, covered the interval in two long marches and
crossed the river al the same place with the rest of his army
(23rd May). “The path was rough, the soldiers underwent much
hardship before arriving at the ford ; and on the way nearly
5,000 men died of thirst” The military advantage of the
movement was immense. By one stroke he had turned the
enemy's position and rendered Dara’s elaborate trenches and
batteries useless. The road to Agra now lay open before him.
ft is now Dara’s turn to abandon the line of the Chambal and
fall back on the capital He had to leave many of his
heavier guns on the river bank, and thus weakened himself in
attillery in the next battle, From the Chambal the victors
marched north andin three days came in touch with the
enemy near Samugarh, about ten miles east of Agra.

§ 5. Dara’s movements after Dfharmat.

The news of the defeat at Dharmat reached the imperial
Court, then at Baluchpur, ten days affer the battle Dara

in appearance only, being 60,000 troopers in number. But
ii was composed of a miscellaneous host of diverse classes
and localities, hastily got together, and not properly co-
ardinaied ner trained in concerted action. Moreover, many
of its commanders were carpel-knights of the Court, having
neither the courage nor the experience of the veterans from
the Deccan. Dara had made the fatal mistake of sending

Lore

away his trustiest adherents and ablest lieutenants with
Sulaiman Shukoh to oppose Shuja and now felt sore need
of such efficient instruments. The foreign Muslim soldiers in
the imperial service resentecl Dara’s reliance on the Rajputs
and left him to his fate) And he was also hampered by
Shah Jahan. Even now the Emperor urged him to avoid
war; he still fondly hoped that the quarrel among his sons
could be peacefully ended by diplomatic messages.

On 18th May, Dara left with his troops for the bank ot
the Chambal, after a most pathetic leave-taking from his aged
father in the Diwan-i-am of Agra fort He reached Dholpur
on the 28nd of the month, and seized all the fords over the
Chambal in the neighbourhood. His aim was to retard
Aurangzib's advance without precipitatine a bate and thus
gain time for Sulaiman Shukoh’s army to join him. But he
soon learnt to his consternation that Aurangzib had crossed
the river forly miles east of Dholpur, on the 23rd. So, he fell
back towards Agra and encamped outside that city near
Samugarh, where Aurangzib arrived on the @8th.

That day, Dara on hearing of Aurangzib’s approach, drew
up his troops and rode out as if to fight. But after sighting
the enemy he halted, waiting to see what his tivals would
do. At sunset he returned to his camp. It was a mast
unwise step; Aurangzib was numerically inferior and his
froops were worn out by a ten mile march in the sun over
a waterless dusty plain, while Dara’s army was fresh. Dara’s
soldiers and their horses and elephants were prostrated by
the extreme heat in which they stood hour after hour doing
nothing, while the prudent Aurangzib rested his men all thal
evening anc night for the morrow’s contest.

86. Battle of Samugach, 20tf May, 1638.

Next morning, 29th. May, Dara marshalled his ranks_on,a
wide plain two miles in front of his camp. His forces

a

numbered about 30,000. Its backbone was composed of the
Rajput contingent and Dara’s own retainers, all devoted to
his interests. But nearly half of his army belonged to the
Emperor’s service, and these men could not be relicd on ;
several of their chiefs, notably [Khalilullah Khan had been
corrupted by Aurangzib. All the artillery of Dara was drawn
up in one row along his entire front ; behind it stood his
foot musketeers, next the elephants, and last of ail dense
masses of cavalry. Dara’s artillery was less mobile and more
inefficiently served than Aurangzib’s, und his horses and
transport animals were out of condition. -*

In opposition to this host stood Aurangzib’s hard-bitten
troops, seasoned veterans on seasoned horses, and his
excellent train of field-pieces handled by the European
gunners of Mir Jumla and well supplied with munitions. There
was absolute unity of command in his army, and all the
officers had been taught to obey without hesitation or question
that master will.

The battle joined about noon. Dara al once took up the
offensive and discharged all his artillery, making a fearful
noise but doing little damage to the enemy at thal long range ;
Aurangzib wisely reserved his powder anct shot.

An hour passed in this kind of cannonade, and then
Dara ordered a charge. His left wing was led by Rustam Khan.
Filing out through the spaces between his guns, it formed a
mass and attacked the opposing artillery with flashing blades
and wild battle-cries. Aurangzib’s chief of artillery, Saf Shikan
Khan, and the musketeers behind his guns stood their ground
well and received the charge with one deadly volley from
the guns and a shower of bullets, arrows, and javelins. The
flood of onset could not reach and overwhelm the guns ;
its speed slackened as the cannon balls ploughed up ils
ranks. So Rustam Khan swerved to his right hand in search
of an easier prey, and galloped towatds Aurangzib's van,


--- Page 74 ---
1658] RAJPUT CHARGE Ai SAMUG RH oF

leaving a cloud of dust behind. But Bahadur Khan wrth the
right flank of Aurangzib’s centre had hurried up to the front
into the gap belween the van and the artillery, and barred
the path of Rustam Khan. A close hand to hand combat
now ensued; Bahadur Khan fell down wounded, and his
division seemed at the point of being touted, when [slam
Khan came to its aid from the right wing and Shaikh Mir
with the advanced reserve. It was now the turn of Rustam
Khan to be outnumbered and borne down. Mortally wound-
ed in his arm, with a dozen other desperate men he
hewed his way to the centre of the enemy’s ranks and there
fell amidst a heap of the slain. The small remnant of Dara’s
left wing now fled back under Sipihr Shukoh.

At the same time a more terrible fight was being waged
on Aurangzib’s feft. There the Rajputs of the imperial van-
guard under Chhatra Sal Hada slipped through the interval
between Zulfiqar’s artillery and Murad’s division and fell
upon that prince with fierce vigour, thus driving a wedge
which separated Murad from Aurangzib’s army. Rajah
Ram Singh Rathor, wearing the gay yellow robe of Aolf
and with a string of priceless pearls tied to his turban, fel!
on Murad’s elephant, crying out in derision, “Yow want to
wrest the throne from Dara !” Shouting to the driver to make
the elephant kneel down if he valued his life, the Rajah flung
his spear at Murad, but it missed the aim, and the prince shot
him dead with an arrow. Other Rajputs fell as they swarmed
round Murad’s elephant, and with their robes “made the
ground look yellow like a field of saffron!” The Rajput
horsemen could not reach the prince on his lofty elephant ;
but Murad received three wounds in his face ; his driver was
killed, and the fawde of his elephant bristled with arrows like
ihe back of a porcupine ; he was borne backwards by this
onslaught.

The victorious Rajputs pressed on to the centre and fell on


--- Page 75 ---
68 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB {cu IV

Auranszib, who was hastening to the aid of Murad on hearing
of the disaster on his left. The clash between these two
powerful forces was terrible. The Rajputs forced their way
to Aurangzib himself, but that prince’s guards offered an oppo-
sition equally heroic, and being themselves fresh they prevailed
ovet the Rajputs who were worn out and thinned in number
by the struggle with Murad. Vet lhe Rajputs fought on against
overwhelming odds “in utter contempt of fife.” But one by
one all their leaders fell—Chhatra Sal Hada, Ram Singh
Rathor, Bhim Singh Gaur and Shivatam Gaur. But the
remnant only made a more frantic struggle, “like :avening dogs,”
as a European eve-witness describes the scene. Rajah Rup
Singh Rathor in reckless audacity jumped down from his horse,
with his drawn blade heweda way to the elephant of Aurangzib,
and fried to cut the girths of the fawda in the haope of
hurling the prince down fo the ground. He slashed the beast’s
leg, but was himself cut to pieces by thebody-guard. The rest
of the Rajputs perished. Thus both the lefl and right wings
of Dara had been annihilated by this time.

8 7. Dara’s own movements at Samugach ; the end.

At the very beginning of the battle, as soon as Rustam
Khan and Chhatra Sal had charged with his left wing and van,
Dara quitted his position in the centre, rode through his
“artillery, and went towards Aurangsib’s right wing in order to
support Rustam Khan. No more fala! mistake could have
been committed. Dara could no longer survey the whole field
and control his troops as their supreme leader 3 and at onee
everything fell into confusion. Secondly, by advancing in
front of his artillery he obstructed its fire, while Aurangzib’s
guns continued to mow down his ranks without any chance of
reply, This mistake ruined Dara more than all other causes put
jogether. Dara now turned to the right in order to avoid the


--- Page 76 ---
1658] DARA’S FULILE MOVEMENTS AT SAMUGARH 69

enemy’s artillery in front of him, and fell upon Shaikh Mir’s
division.

Just then Atrangzib was left without any guards. If Dara
could now have forced his way to his rival’s side, the victory
would have been his. “But he made a short halt, owing to
the difficulties of the ground and to the fatigue that overcame
him.” His force lost its growing momentum, and the vigour
of its onslaught greatly slackened, and the golden chance was
lost for ever. For, in the meantime Aurangzib had dressed his
ranks and made new dispositions, and Dara was soon after-
wards called upon to abandon his forward movement straight
on his rival’s clephant and to turn aside towards his own right
wing in order to back the troops of Chhatra Sal. Thus Dara
made a long movement across his entire front from the
extreme left fo near the extreme right. The friehtful heat struck
down his men and horses during this unprofitable manceuvre,
while the artillery stationed in the enemy’s front fired volleys
straight into his left flank. The men with him were exhausted
by this long and toilsome march over loose burning sand,
amidst suffocaling dust, and under a blazing sun which made
their armour blister the skin, while not a drop of water could
be had to quench their thirst.

Meantime, Aurangzib’s vanguard, in obedience to his rigid
discipline, had kept its proper position. But now seeing Dara’s
two wings and van overthrown and his centre in disorder and
out of its proper place, Prince Muhammad Sultan, at the head
of his father’s van, sprang forward to attack Dara. At the
same time Aurangsib’s victorious right wing wheeled round to
envelop Dara’s division, while the batteries from the right
and left alike assailed it, This was really the end of the fight.
Dara had learnt of the death of his best generals, and now
Aurangzib’s troops, “like the waves of the sea, approached
him with countless guns in front of them,” Their heavy and
well-directed fire mowed down the troops’ still around him every


--- Page 77 ---

minute. Dara’s own elephant now became “a target for the
enemy's balls,” which began to carry off his personal
attendants. The wretched prince had no help but to set down
from this elephant and fake horse. At once all was over
with him. His remaining troops all over the field, find
ing his fawda empty, concluded that their master had fallen,
Already they were half dead with fatieue and thirst, and now
a desolaling hot wind sprang up and struck Dara’s fainting
troops in the face. Many of them died of thirst, without
strength to use their arms. What still remained of the imperial
army had been only waiting for a decent pretext for flight,
and the sudden disappearance of Dara from the back of his
elephant gave them the wished for opportunity. At once the
whole army broke and fled in the utmost disorder. Dara
stood almost alone, deserted by all save a few hereditary
followers. They took him out of the field to Agra.

The last trace of resistance now vanished ; bul there was
no pursuit. Nor was any pursuit needed, for no victory could
be more complete. On the side of the vanquished ten thou-
sand men had fallen, besides horses and transport animals
beyond count. Among the slain imperial commanders of high
rank, nine Rajputs and nineteen Muslims are mentioned by
name.

Bravest among so many brave men was Rao Chhatra Sal
Hada, the chieftain of Bundi and the heto of fifty-two fights,
“With his Hadas clad in their saffron robes, the ensigns of
aeath or viclory, the Bundi prince formed the vanguard of
Dara. Cheering on his men, he mounted his elephant, but

* That Dara dismounted from his elephant at a time of extreme danger, when
he had lost all hope of victory, is agsetled by 4. MW. (100, Aqil (43), Mastum (638), and
Kambu (152) These contemporary and first-rate authorities refute the bazar gossip
teproduced by Manucci and Bernier that Dara changed his eluphant for a horse at
the treacherous advice of Khalilullah Khan at a time when he had almost compleiely
defeated Aurangzib, and thal this act on the part of Dara turned his assmed victory
into a rout. (Storiz, 1. 931-989 ; Bernier, 53-54, also Ishvratdas, 946.95a,)

whilst encouraging them by his voice and example, a cannon-
ball hitting his elephant, the animal turned and fled. Chhatra
Sal leaped from his back and called for his steed, exclaiming
“My elephant may turn his back on the enemy, but never
shall his master.” Mounting his horse, and forming his men
into a dense mass, he led them tothe charge against Prince Murad
whom he singled out, and had his lance balanced for the
issue, when a ball pierced his forehead.” In the two battles
of Dharmat and Samugarh no less than twelve princes of the
blood, together with the head of every Hada clan, gave up
their lives.

The most renowned victim of the day, however, was
Rustam Khan, surnamed Firuz Jang, the hero of the Usbalk
and Persian wars.

The army of Aurangzib lost only one chief of the first rank,
Azam Khan, who died of the excessive heat,

§ 8. Events at Agra and captivity of Shah Jofian, June 1658.

From the fatal field of Samugarh, Dara reached Agra with
a few attendants at about 9 o’clock at night, and shut himself
up in his house in the city. There was universal alarm and
lamentation in the royal family, . Shah Jahan sent word to Data
to come to the fort and see hit ; but Dara was utterly broken
down in body and spirit, and declined saying, “I cannot show
my face to your Majesty in my present wretched plight.
Permit me to go away with your farewell blessing on the
long journey that is before me.”

The miserable prince, with his wife children and a dozen
servants, set off from Agra towards Delhi at, 3, o'clock inthe
morning. Mules laden” with gold coins from the palace treasury
were sent with him by order of Shah Jahan, and he took away as
mtich of his own jewels and cash as he could transport in that
hurry. For the next two days small groups of his followers


--- Page 79 ---
72 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB icu. [V

began to join him on the way, so that his force was raised to
5,000 men by the time he reached Delhi.

After the battle of Samugarh, Aurangzib went to Murad,
and congratulated him, saying that the victory was due entirely
io his younger brother’s heroism and that Murad’s reign
would date from that day. He even nursed the wounded
Murad affectionately.

In two marches from the  battle-field the victors arrived
in the garden of Nur Manzil or Dhara outside Agra ({st
lune). Here they stayed for ten days. Every day large
numbers of coutliers, nobles and officers deserted the imperial
side and joined them, and so did the former officers of Dara.

The day after Samugarh, Autangzib wrote to Shah Jahan
directly, excusing his late actions as forced upon him by his
enemies, On reaching Nur Manzil he received a reply in
Shah Jahan’s own hand, inviting him to an interview. This,
afler some hesitation, Aurangzib declined to do, at the advice
of some of his friends (especially Shaista Khan and Khalilullal)
who told him that Shah Jahan had formed a plot to get
Aurangzib murdered by his Tartar guard-women as soon as
he would enter Agra fort.

The mask was at last thrown away, and on the Sth of June
the prince began the siege of Agra fort, after sending his
eldest son Muhammad Sultan to oceupy Agra city (rd June)
and maintain order there. Shah Jahan had shut the gates of
Agra fort, prepared to stand a siege there. It was one of
the strangest forts of that age, and Aurangzib’s artillery was
quite ineffective on its defences, Success by breaching and
assault was therefore out of the question. A regular investment
would have detained the victorious broffiers there for months
and even years and thus given Dara time fo raise a new army,

So, Aurangzib sent his men to make a sudden tush and
seize the outside of the water gate (ééxird of the fort which
opens on the Jamuna. Thus the water-supply of the garrison

was cut off and they began to suffer the horrors of thirst in
midsummer. The few old and long disused wells within the
forl yielded only a bitter water unfit for drinking. At this,
many of the Emperor's officers, pampered idlers of the Court,
slipped out of the fort.

For three days Shah Jahan held out under these conditions.
He had made a pathetic personal appeal to Aurangzib entreating
him not to kill a living father by thirst, but to thal
jetter Aurangzib had replied, “It is your own doing.” Then,
amidst raging thirst, with only despair and treason around
him, the aged Emperor decided to yield. On 8th June he
opened the gates of the fort to Aurangzib’s officers and
became a prisoner within the harem of the palace, being
confined fo the quarters behind the Hall of Public Audience.
He was deprived of all power; a strong force was posted
in and around the fort to prevent rescue, and careful
watch was kept on his eunuchs lest they should carry letiers
from him oulside. The vast treasures of Agra fort—ithe
accumulations of three generations of prosperous rulers of
India, passed into Aurangzib’s possession.

On 10th June Princess Jahanara visited Awurangzib to try
the effect of her personal influence and sisterly persuasion.
She proposed, in Shah Jahan’s name, a partition of the
empire among the four brothers. Aurangzib naturally declined.

i
89. Murad Bakfsh's captivity and death.

~On {3th June Aurangzib set out .from.Agra city towards
Dejhi in pursuit of Dara. But on the way, at Mathura, he
had to halt because an alarming situation had arisen on
account of Murad’s jealous and wilful conduct. This prince's
courtiers were felling him how power was daily slipping out
of his grasp and Aurangzib was becoming all in all. He
was keen on reigning as king, but Aurangzib seemed to be


--- Page 81 ---
74 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZID len. V

putting off the fulfilment of that desire to a more and more
distant future. Therefore, Murad must assert himself, if he
was not to be made a cat's paw and then thrown away by
Aurangzib.

Led on by such counsellors, Murad began to act openly
in opposition to Aurangzib: he increased his army, seduced
irom Aurangzib’s side many of the recently joined imperial
troops by the promise of higher pay and greater licence,
and conferred titles. Lastly he gave up visiting Aurangzib a3
beneath his dignity, Thus, an open opposition to Aurangezib
was set up in the allied camp.

The situation was very critical, But  Aurangzib’s
plan was quickly formed and skilfully carried out. He _ first
luted  Murad’s suspicion to sleep by presenting him
with 90 lakhs of Rupees and 953 horses, and invited him to
a feast for celebrating his complete recovery from his wounds
and for maturing a plan of campaign against the fugitive
Dara. Lastly, Aurangzib heavily bribed and won over to his
side Murad’s favourite body-servant Nur-ud-cdin Khawas, who
induced Murad to accept his brother’s invitation and enter
Aurangzib’s camp when returning from a hant (25th June).

Murad was cordially received by Aurangzib, well fed, plied
with wine, and when asleep deprived of his arms and made
a prisoner. At midnight the captive was sent in a covered
ladies’ Aawda, under a strong cavalry escort to Salimgarh and
thence to the State-prison of Gwalior. This “excellent stratagem”
had been carried out so smoothly that Murad’s followers did
not hear of his fate Hill it was too lale. Next morning his
leaderless soldiery were taken into Aurangzib’s service, and
even his devoted officers had no course left open to them
but to submit to this new master. The entire establishment
and property of Murad passed into Aurangzib’s possession,

Murad lived for three years in the fortress of Gwalior,

and which narrowly missed success through Murad’s own
thoughtlessness, determined Aurangzib to get rid of him. Ai
the Emperor’s instigation, the second son of Ali Nagi demanded
retaliation in blood from Murad for the murder of his father
at Ahmadabad in 1657, This, under the Islamic law, the
judges were bound to srant. So, on 4th December, 166!, the
luckless aspirant to the throne of Delhi was beheaded by two
slaves in the prison cell of Gwalior and his corpse was buried
within thal fort.

CHAPTER VW
WAR OF SUCCESSION ; END OF DARA AND SHUJA

$ 1. Pursuit of Dara after Samugarh.

4
Dara reached Delhi on Sth June 1638 and tried to raise

and equip a new army by appropriating the Government
property in the capital. But a week afterwards he left Delhi
for Lahor, on learning that the fall of Agra fort had set
Aurangzib free fo pursue him. \The Panjab was strongly
attached to Dara; the province had long been his viceroyalty
and was now held by his faithful deputy Sayyid Ghairat
Khan. Leaving Delhi at the head of 10,000 men, Dara
reached Lahor on 3rd July, and spent a month and a half
there in completing his war preparations. Seizing the imperial
treasure there, he assembled an army of 20,000 men and
sent off strong detachments to guard the ferries over the
Satlej at Talwan and Rupar,

In the meantime, Aurangzib had deputed Khan-i-Dauran
to wrest Allahabad from Datra’s men and Bahadur Khan to
take up the pursuit of Dara, and then pushed on to Delhi,
Sth July. At this capital he stayed three weeks, constructing
a new administration in the place of the old one, and finally
he crowned himself Emperor under the title of dlamgir
Ghazi on Qist July. Khalilullah Khan was appointed governor
of the Panjab and sent to reinforce the pursuit of Dara.

In the night of Sth August, Bahadur Khan crossed the
Satie} by surprise at Rupar, and Dara’s generals fell back
from that river to Govindwal on ithe Bias. But when
Aurangzib from Delhi reached the Satlej, Dara fled from
Lahor (18th August) fo Multan, with his family and treasure,


--- Page 84 ---
1638] PURSUIT OF DARA THROUGH SINDH 77

by boat. Once more Dara’s genius quailed before that of
Aurangzib ; he despaired of success, and his despair infected
his troops.

Aurangzib’s forces set off from Lahor on 30th August at
the heels of Dara, and that Emperor himself joined the
pursuers on 17th September. But Dara again Hed, from
Multan (13th September) to Sakkar (13th October), From
the environs of Multan, Aurangzib turned back (30th Sept)
for Delhi to meet Shuja’s invasion, but the chase of Dara
was relentlessly continued by Saf Shikan Khan and Shaikh
Mir at the head of two strong columns, totalling 15,000 men,
following the two banks of the Indus.

At Sakkar the imperialists learnt (3rd October) that Dara
had left mach of his property and his big guns in the fort
of Bhakkar in charge of his eunuch Basant, with many
European gunners under Nicholas Manucci, and himself fled
towards Schwan, deserted by all his troops except 3,000 men.
Even the trusty Daud Khan was at last driven to leave his
unjustly suspicious master. At Sehwan the imperialists came
up with Dara by forced marches (Gist Oct) and occupied
both banks of the Indus, hoping to intercept him. But they
were very weak in boats, and Dara who was stronger in that
arm dashed through the broad river (Qnd Nov.) in safely and
reached Tatta (13th Nov). The imperialisis made forced
marches after him to Tatta (1Sth), but learnt that Dara had
fled further south to Badin (@4th) and was marching over
the gulf of Cutch towards Gujrat.

The pursuers were now fecalled to Courf; the pursuit
which they had carried on with such unflagging vigour and
amazing endurance for three months since Dara leff Lahor, had
missed success, when almost within their grasp, solely through
their lack of boats.

§ 2. Dara in Rajputana ; battle of Deorai.

After leaving Badin, 55 miles east of Tatta, Data crossed
the Rann or salt lagoon (end of November), — suffering
unspeakable hardship through lack of water. Arrived at Bhuj,
the capital of the island of Cutch, he was welcomed and
given every help by the Rajah, as also by the Jam of
Nawanagar in Nathiawad. Thus he arrived at Ahmadabad
at the head of 3,000 men. Here Shah Nawaz Khan, the new
governor of the province, joined him and opened the royal
treasury to him (th January, 1659), Dara now raised his
army fo 22,000 men, brought away the artillery of Surat, and
learning that Shuja had advanced beyond Allahabad to atlack
Aurangzib, he made a dash towards Asra at the same time.
On the way he received an invitation to Ajmir from Jaswant
Singh, who promised to join him with the Rathors and other
Rajouts.

But, in the meantime, Aurangzib afler crushing Shuja al
Khajwa (Sth Jan), bad won over Jaswant with the help
of Mirza Rajah Jai Singh by means of mingled threats
of invasion and hopes of promotion. Dara had no help
but to fight, for Aurangzib had atrived near him. He
wisely changed his plan. Instead of fighting a pitched
battle in an open plain, he decided to hold the pass of Deorai,
four miles south of Ajmir, in the narrow breadth of which a
small host can keep a superior foree of assailants back. His
two flanks were protected by the hills of Bithli and Gohla;
while behind him lay the rich city of Ajmir, whence he could
easily draw his stipplies. He ran a low wall south of his
position, from hill to hill across the valley, with trenches in
front and redoubis at different points.

Aurangzib approached this position from the south, and
began a bombardment of it from the sunset of 12th March,
1659, to the night following the 13th. Dara’s artillery and


--- Page 86 ---
1650] DARA DEFEATLD AI DEORAL 7o

muskets trom their high and shellered position showered death
on Aurangzib’s unprotected gunners and infantry, while the latter
could not fire back with effect. The enemy’s trenches were impreg-
nable. So, on the 14th Auranezib held a council of war and
adopted a new plan of atlack, wiz, to make a concentrated
attack in overwhelming strength on the enemy's left wing under
Shah Nawaz Khan, while their right wine was to be kept in
play by the imperial division opposite if; but the success of
the scheme was to depend not on this frontal attack but on
a secret movement to turn the enemy’s left rear (the Gokla hill),
which was to be scaled from behind by Rajah Rajrup of the
Jammu hills and his clansmen expert in mountaineering, who
had discovered a path to its top.

Towards the evening of the {4th, the imperial army massed
in front of the enemy’s left delivered their assault upon
Shah Nawaz Khan's trenches. Their artillery reapened fire
with great rapidity and prevented the other divisions of Dara’s
army from leaving their {renches and marching across the
front fo aid their hard-pressed brethren on the left. The hardest
fight raged in this part of the field. Dara’s men obstinately
defended their lines. Wave after wave of the imperialists swarmed
up fo the charge; and at last they pushed back all the enemy
out of the plain and won the ground to the edge of the trenches.

By this time Rajrup’s men had toiled up the back of the
Gokla hill, while the enemy wete absorbed in the severe
contest in their front. They planted their banners on the top
and raised a shout Dara’s left wing was seized with cespair
at their rear being, thus turned, but many of the men still

True, only one of the four entrenchments had so far been
carried ; but it was enough: Dara’s lines had been fatally
pierced and rendered untenable by the turning of the Gokla
hill. Accompanied by his son Sipihr Shukoh and only a dozen
af fis men, Dara fled from the field in headlong haste towards
Gujrat. The country round Ajmir became a wild scene of
plunder ; thousands of Rajputs had assembled in the neigh-
bourhood at the call of Jaswant and were hovering round like
vuitures for their expected prey. They now looted the property
and transport animals of the vanguished army.

8 3. Flight and capture of Dara.

During the battle of Deorai, Dara’s harem and treasure had
been left on the bank of the Anasagar lake (at Ajmir), on
elephanis, camels and mutes, in charge of the faithful eunuch
Khwajah Maqul and an escort of troops, ready for flight.
These fled from the place in the night of the 14th and joined
Dara near Mairta in the afternoon of the 15th. But Aurangzib
had already detached a strong force under Jai Singh and Bahadur
Khan in pursuit of them, and therefore Dara could not resi
anywhere bul had to resume his march with the same haste
as before. Only 2,000 troopers accompanied him when he left
Mairta. Covering thirty miles or even more a day in their
rush to Gujrai, they underwent extreme misery from heat and
dust and want of fents and transport animals. Their few
horses and camels perished from heat and overwork.

Everywhere Dara found Aurangzib’s letters had preceded
him and the local officers were ready to seize him. His last
hope was gone when his messenger returned from Ahmadabad
with the dismal news that he would be resisted if he tried to
enter that city, At this destruction of their last hope of refuge
the pariy was “overwhelmed with confusion and dismay, ...
anc the shrieks of the females drew tears from every eve ,


--- Page 88 ---
1659] SUFFERINGS OF DARA IN FLIGHT St

Dr. Bernier who was attending on Dara’s sick wife, gives a heart-
rending picture of their misery and suffering at this time.
“Reduced to the poorest and sorriest dress, ... accompanied
by one horse, one bullock-cart, five camels for his ladies, and
a few other camels for transport, his retinue shrunk to a few
men,” the chosen heir to the richest throne in Asia crossed
the terrible Rann once again, and reached the southern coast
of Sindh (beginning of May).

Here, too, he found his path fo lower Sindh closed by the
forethought of Aurangzib, who had sent down Khalilullah Khan
from Lahor to Bhakkar. Aurangzib’s local officers and Jai
Singh's advanced detachments were converging on their prey
from north, east and south-east. Only one path of escape
remained open: Dara turned to the north-west, crossed the
Indus and entered Siwisian, intending to flee to Persia by way
of Qandahar.

In the meantime Jai Singh from Ajmir had been pushing
on behind Dara, covering {6 to 920 miles a day, in spite of
scarcity of water, want of fodder, and exhaustion of his horses
and transport animals. Following Dara’s tracks he crossed the
lesser and the greater Rann and the island of Cutch, suffering
frightful privations on the way. “At places grain sold at a seer
per Rupee, at others no food at all could be procured.” But
he pursued his course with grim tenacity ancl reached the Indus
on the border of Siwistan on I[1th June 1659, though more
than three-fourths of his troop horses perished during the
journey. Then, learning that Dara had gone out of Mughal
India, he began his return march to Hindustan up the Indus.

But Dara’s family were utterly opposed tothe idea of
migrating to Persia. His beloved wife, Nadira Banu, was
seriously ill and the privations of a journey through the
desolate Bolan Pass and the inhospitable region of Qandahar
would have killed her. Dara, therefore, changed his mind and
looked about for a chieftain in that neighbourhod who would

give him a safe shelter and the services of his clansmen. Such
a friend he hoped fo find in Malik Jiwan, the samindar of
Dadar, a place nine miles east of the Indian end of the Bolan
Pass, Years ago this Afghan chief hac been sentenced by
Shah Jahan to be trampled to death by an elephant. Dara,
fhen at the height of his father’s favour, hacl successfully begged
the condemned man’s life and liberty from the Emperor. Ile
now looked tor Jiwan’s gratitude, and reached Dadar, where the
chief took him to his house, showing him every respect and
care (probably 6th June).

On the way to Dadar, Nadira Banu succumbed to hard-
ship and want of medicine and rest. Dara was frantic with
grief ai losing his life’s companion. “The world grew dark
in his eyes. He was utterly bewildered. His judgment and
prudence were entirely gone.’ He sent her corpse to Lahor
for burial in the graveyard of the saint Mian Mir (his own
spiritual guide), under escort of all the 70 troopers. still left
at his side and his most devoted officer, Gul Muhammad,
He offered his companions a free choice belween  relurning
to their homes and accompanying him to Persia. Thus it
happened that nota single devoted follower now remained
with Dara, and he became utterly helpless and dependent
upon his host’s fidelity.

( Cupidity overcame the Afghan’s gratitude and fidelity to
plighted word. He treacherously arresled Dara and_ his
younger son and two daughters (th June) and delivered
them to Bahadur Khan. \

8 4. Humiliation and murder of Dara.

When the prisoners arrived al Delhi they were paraded
through the streets of the capital with disgrace (29th August).
Dara was seated in an tncovered fAawda on the back of a

small female elephant covered with dirt. By his side was

his second son, Sipthr Shukoh, a Jad of fourteen; and
behind them with a naked sword sat their ferocious gaoler,
the slave Nazar Beg. The heir to the tichest throne in the
world was now clad in a travel-tainted dress of the coarsest
cloth, with a dark dingy-coloured turban, such as only the
poorest wear, on his head, and no necklace or jewel adorning
his person. His feet were chained, though his hands were
free. Exposed to the full blaze of an August sun, he was
faken in this guise through the scenes of his former glory
anc splendour. In the bitterness of disgrace he did not raise
his head, nor cast his glance on any side, but sat “like a
erushed twig.”

The pity of the citizens swept every other feeling away,
The crowd assembled was immense, and everywhere, Bernier
observed, the people were «weeping and lamenting the fate
of Dara.

That evening Aurangzib held a private consultation with
his ministers about Dara’s fate. Danishmand Khan (Bernier’s
patron) pleaded for his life, but Shaista Khan, Muhammad
Amin Khan, Bahadur Khan, and the Princess Raushanara from
the harem demanded his death for the good of Church and
State. The pliant theologians in the Emperor’s pay signed a
decree stating that Dara deserved death on the ground of
his deviation from Islam.

A riot by the citizens of Delhi against the traitor Malik
liwan (recently created a hazari with the litle of Bakhtiyar
Khan), when on his way to the Court, on the 30th, precipitated
the end of Dara. That verg night Nazar Beg and some
other slaves visited Dara’s prison in Khawaspura, tore away
Sipihr Shukoh from his father’s arms and hacked Dara to .
pieces. By Aurangzib’s order the corpse was_placed_on an
elephant, paraded through the streets of the cify a second
time, and then buried in a vault under the dome of the tomb
of Humayun.

§ 5. End of Sulaiman Shukoh.

We shall now trace the fate of Dara’s eldest son, Sulaiman
Shukoh. After his victory over Shuja near Benares, he had
purstied his defeated uncle through Bihar to Mungir, when
early in May 1658, he received asummons from his father
to return quickly to his side as Aurangzib had triumphed at
Dharmat. So, he hurriedly patchecl up a peace with Shuja
and set out on his return. On 2nd June, when 105 miles
west of Allahahad, he received news of his father’s ruin at
Samugarh. His soldiers were distracted; Jai Singh and Dilir
Khan, his greatest generals, as well as all the other imperial
officers feft him for Aurangzib. Only 6,000 men, fess than
one-third of Sulaiman’s army, accompanied him in his retreat
to Allahabad (4th June), where he wasted a precious week
in distraction not knowing what lo do with his cumbrous and
costly furniture and plate and vast harem of women. At
last, at the advice of his chief followers the Sayyids of Barha,
he decided to make a wide loop round Delhi, march by the
northern side of the Ganges, through their home the Middle
Doab, and then cross the rivers at the foot of the hills, in
order to reach his father in the Panjab withoul fear of
interception.

Sulaiman rapidly moved by way of Nagina to Chandi, on the
bank of the Ganges opposite to Haraiwar. Numbers of soldiers
deserted him daily, and strong enemy forces pushed up from
Delhi barred his path everywhere in the south, east and west.
So, Sulaiman fled to the Srinagar hills for an asylum, his Sayyid
followers of Barha refusing fo accompany him there. Prithwi
Singh, the Rajah of Srinagar (in Garhwal} admitted him on
condition of his being accompanied by his family and seventeen
servanis only but none of his soldiers. The Rajah was all kind-
ness and attention to his princely guest in distress, and Sulaiman
enjoyed peace in his rude but safe refuge for a year,

Lay

But when Aurangzib was at last triumphant over all isis
brothers, he turned against Sulaiman. On 27th July 1659 be
sent Rajah Rajrup to secure the surrender of Sulaiman from
the Rajah of Srinagar ; but for a year anda half his efforts
were futile. Aurangzib next employed Jai Singh, who wrote to
Prithwi Singh not to destroy his kingdom by disobeying the
Emperor’s order. The Garhwal Rajah was old and refused to
undertake the sin and shame of betraying an accepted refugee.
But his son and heir, Medini Singh, was more worldly-minded ;
the hope of rewards from Delhi conquered his scruples. There
was also the fear of losing his kingdom, as Aurangzib was
instigating the neighbouring and rival hill-Rajahs to invade and
annex Garhwal. On hearing of this decision of his host, Sulaiman
tried to escape over the snow to Ladak, but was pursued, captured
wounded, delivered to Aurangzib’s agent, and brought to Delhi
on @nd January, 1661.

On Sth January the prisoner was placed before his dread uncle
in the Hall of Private Audience of the Delhi palace. His youth,
extreme beauly, martial fame, and present misery deeply interested
the courtiers and even the ladies of the imperial harem in his fate.
Aurangzib spoke to him with apparent kindness, “Be comforted ;
no harm shall befall you. You shall be treated with tenderness.”
The prince made the sa/am or sign of grateful acknowledgment...
He then told the Emperor, with much self-possession, that ifit were
intended to give him the pousfa* to drink, he begged that he might
be immediately put to death, Aurangzib promised in a solemn
manner, and in a loud voice, that this drink should most
certainly not be administered.

* The pousia is a drink made of poppy-heads crushed-and soaked in water for
a night. This was the potion generally given to princes confined in the forlress of
Gwaliot, whose heads the Emperor was deterred by public shame from taking
of. A large cup of this beverage was brought fo them early in the morning, and
they were not given anything to eat until it was swallawed, This drink emaciated
the wretched victims, who lost their strength and Intellect by slaw degrees, became
jorpid and senseless, and at length died. "

wf The captive was sent to Gwalior and in that dismal state-prison
Aurangzib in violation of his ‘solemn promise’ caused the death of
the unhappy Sulaiman Shukoh (May 1662) by overdoses of opium.

86. Sfuja’s first advance to contest the succession ;
battle of Bafadutput.

Prince Muhammad Shuja, the second son of Shah Jahan and
governor of Bengal, was a man of great intelligence, clegant
iaste, and amiable disposition. But his constant devotion to
pleasure, the easy administration of Bengal, and his 17 years’
residence in that enervating country, had made him weak,
indolent and negligent, incapable of arduous toil, sustained effort,
vigilant caution, or profound combination. [le had allowed
his administration to dvift, his army to grow inefficient, and all
his departments to fall into a slack and sleepy condition. His
mental powers were as keen as before: but they required great
emergencies to call them forth, and shone only by flashes; he
was still capable of vigorous action, but only fitfully.

The story of Shah Jahan’s illness, with the usual exaggeration,
reached Shuja at Rajmahal, then the capital of Bengal, and he
immediately crowned himself Emperor with the title of Abul
Fauz Nasir-ud-din Muhammad, Timur Ill, Alexander I, Shah
Shuja Ghagi. «

Statting with alarge army, an excellent park of artillery, and
the highly useful war-boats (nawwara) of Bengal, he reached
Benares about 24th January, 1658, Meantime Dara had despatched
against him an ax my of 22,000 men under his eldest son
Sulaiman Shukoh, assisted by the able and experienced Mirza
Rajah Jai Singh and Dilfir Khan Ruhela.

Early in the morning of 14th February, Sulaiman
suddenly attacked Shuja’s camp, at Bahadurpur, 4
miles north-east of Benares. The surprise was so complete


--- Page 94 ---
1658} SHUJA’S TWO ALTEMPTS TO REACH AGRA 87

that the sleeping Bengal soldiers and their leader had
no time to put on their tunics, but fled away leaving
everything behind. With great difficulty Shuja, mounted
on an elephant, forced his way out of the ring of his enemies
and found safety in his war-boats, whose gun-fire kept the
enemy away from the bank. His entire camp and property,
estimated at fifty lakhs of Rupees, were seized by the victors ;
even the hamblest soldier had to abandon his all.

The panic-stricken army fled by the land roufe through
Saseram to Patna, robbed by the villagers on the way. But
hearing of the approach of the pursuing imperialists, Shuja
fled to Mungir and blocked the road with his trenches and
batteries. This brought Sulaiman sharply to a halt at Suraj-
garh, 15 miles south-west of Mungir, and he wasted precious
months here without being able to advance. But the news
of Dharmat forced him to make a hurtied peace with Shuja,
leaving Béngal Eastern Bihar and Orissa to that
prince (7th May), and set out on his return to Agra.

' Aurangzib, after crowning himself at Delhi @1 July), wrote
a friendly letter to Shuja, adding the enfire province of Bihar
to his viceroyalty and promising him other favours.

'" ‘The news of Aurangzib’s absence in the far off Panjab at the
heels of Dara revived Shuja’s ambition. Now was the lime to
conquer the undefended country up to Agra and release Shah
Jahan. So, at the end of October, 1658, Shuja_ started from
Patna with 25,000 cavalry and artillery and boats, and reached
Khajwa, three days’ march beyond Allahabad on 30th
December. Here be found Sultan Muhammad barring his path.
In the meantime, Aurangzib after abandoning the pursuit of
Dara at Multan (30th September), had hastened back to Delhi
by forced marches (20th November), and strongly teinforced
his army near Allahabad with men and money. Shuja’s open
road to Agra was now blocked, and on 9nd January 1659 the
Emperor himself joined his son near Kora, eight miles west of

Shuja’s position. Mir Juma, too, arrived there from the Deccan

on the same day.

$7. Khajwa: Jaswant’s treachery and firmness of Aurangsib.

On 4th January, Aurangzib marched his army in perfect
order fill he arrived one mile in front of the enemy’s cartip,
Here he halted, his soldiers maintained their exact positions,
each man sleeping on the ground with his armour on and
his saddied horse standing at his head. That night Mir Jumla,
with a born general’s instinct, seized a mound midway between
the two armies and by hard labour dragged 40 guns to it,
which commanded the enemy’s camp. Careful vigil was kept
by his officers throughout the night.

A few hours before the dawn of the 3th of January, the day
fixed far the battle, a confused noise arose in the vanguard of
Aurangzib’s army ; the alarm and disorder rapidly spread
through the entire camp. The air was filled with the yells of
the assailants, the cries of the fugitives, and the tramp of
horsemen recklessly galloping away. The darkness heightened
the confusion. The root of all this trouble was Maharajah
Jaswant Singh, the commander of the imperial right wing, who
had brooded over some fancied slight ar neglect and matured
a deep plan of vengeance. He had, it was said, senta secret
message fo Shuja saying that he would attack the imperial
eamp behind the field at the close of the night, and that while
the Emperor would hasten to the rear to tepel him
Shuja should swiffly fall on the disordered army and
crush it between two adversaries. So, shortly after midnight
he got his 14,000 Rajputs ready, turned his back
fo the field, rushed the camp of Prince Md, Sullan which lay
in the path of his flight, and there carried off everything that
the Rajputs could lay their hands on. Much of the Emperor's
own camp suffered the same fate. The Rajputs took the road

to Agra, but in the darkness and surprise the confusion spread
to the army at the front i

But the situation was saved by Aurangzib’s wonderfut
coolness and Shuja’s hesitation. Shuja received Jaswant's
message, heard of the tumult, but did not leave his own camp
at night, fearing if might be a mere ruse contrived between
Aurangzib and Jaswant to lure him on to his destruction !

The Emperor was at his fafajfud prayer in his field-tent,
when the news of Jaswant’s attack and desertion reached him.
Without uttering a word, he merely waved his hand as if to say,
“If he is gone, let him go!’ After deliberately finishing the
prayer, he issued from the tent, mounted a fakfit-l-rawan
(portable chair), and addressed his officers, “This incident is a
metrey youchsafed to us by God. If the infidel had played the
traitor in the midst of the battle, all would have been lost. His
flight (now) is good for us.”

So Aurangeib firmly kept his own position, and prevented
the confusion from spreading to his division. Orderlies were
sent off to urge the leaders of the various corps not to stir
from their own places, but to rally the fugitives. With the return
of daylight many faithful officers who had been swept far away
by the tide of flight hastened to rejoin the imperial banners,
round which more than 50,000 soldiers were now assembled
as against Shuja’s 23,000.

§ 8 Battle of Khajwa.

Shuja knew that he could not adopt the customary plan
of battle, making his foree correspond, division for division, to
the enemy’s dispositions. is small force would then have been
overlapped and swallowed up by the vastly extended front of
an enemy who outnumbered him as three fo one, So, with
great judgment he made a new formation today: alt his army
was drawn up in one long fine, behind the artillery. With true


--- Page 97 ---
90 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cu V

generalship Shuja decided to assume the offensive, and make up
for the smallness of his number by the moral superiority which
the attacking party always has.

The battle began at 8 A.M. with a furious discharge of
cannon, reckets and muskets; then the two vans closed
together and plied their bows. Sayyid Alam, at the head of
Shuja’s right wing, charged the imperial left wing, driving in
front three infuriated elephants, each brandishing a two-maund
iron chain in its trunk. Neither man nor beast could
stand their impetuous onset. The imperial left, which
had no prince or great general to command it, broke and
fled. The panic spread even to the centre; the soldiers
ran abouf in confusion. To make matters worse, a false
report of fhe Emperor’s death suddenly spread through the
ranks and many fled away. The enemy, after clearing
the left wing, pushed on towards the centre, where
only 2,000 troopers now remained to guard the Emperor.
But his two reserves flung themselves forward and barred
the enemy's path, The Emperor with the centre turned his
elephant’s head to the left, in order to support that wing.
Sayyid Alam was repelled and fled back by the same path
that he had come.

But the three elephants continued to advance wildly, their
wounds having made them fiercer than before. One of
them came up to Aurangsib’s elephant. It was the critical
moment of the battle. If the Emperor had given ground or
turned back, his whole army would have fled. But he stood
fike a rock, chaining the legs of his elephant to prevent its
fight At his order one of his matchlockmen, Jalal Khan,
shot down the mafut of the attacking elephant, a brave royal
mafut oimbly leaped on ts back and brought the riderless
beast under his control. The Emperor now got breathing
time, and tutned to succour his right, which had been
hard-pressed by a charge of the enemy's vanguard and left


--- Page 98 ---
1659] BAUILE OF KIIAPWA o1

wing under Prince Buland Akhtar. In spite of their smal{
number, their gallant charge dislodged their opponents ; many
of the imperialists fled away. Freed from the danger on his
left, Aurangzib now looked at his right and found there signs
of confusion and flight But even in the greatest difficulty and
danger, his coolness and presence of mind did not desert
him. It at once struck him that, as his own front had hitherto
been turned towards the left, if he were now to face suddenly
round and march to the right, the rest of the army would
interpret this volfe face as flight. So, he first sent orderlies
‘to the van to tell the generals of his real object and to urge
them to fight on without fear.

Then he wheeled the centre round and joined his hard-
pressed right wing. The succour came not a minute too soon.
This was the decisive move of the day. The tide of battle
now rolled resistlessly against Shuja. The imperial right,
newly strengthened, made a counter-charge and swept away
the enemy from before them, with great carnage.

Meantine the imperial van, under Zulfigar Khan and
Sulian Muhammad, had beaten back the attack on it, advanced,
and shaken the enemy's front line. So thick was the shower
of cannonballs, rockets and bullets from Aurangzib’s army
that no man could stand it, Thete was now a general
advance of the whole imperial army, tight, centre, and left.
“Like masses of dark clouds, they ‘surrounded Shuja’s own
division (the centre), his two flanks having been scattered
already. The cannon-balls flew about his own head and
killed many of his personal attendants.” Therefore, he left the
dangerous prominence of the elephani’s back and took
horse."

This was the end of the struggle. All was now lost, as
his soldiers believed that their master was dead. In a moment
all that still remained of the Bengal army broke and fled.
Shuja galloped away from the field with his sons, his general
Sayyid Alam and a small body of troops. His entire camp
and baggage were plundered by the imperialists. 114 pieces
of cannon and 11 of the celebrated elephants of Bengal

beeame the victor’s prize.

89, The pursuit of Shuja and the war in Bifac.

In the afternoon following the victory of Khajwa, Autangzib
sent a pursuing column under Muhammad Sultan after Shuja,
Reinforcements under Mir Jumla soon raised this force to
30,000 men, Shuja fled through Benates and Patna
to Mungir, where he made a _ fortnight’s — stand,
(49th Feb.—6th March). The city of Mungir stands in a
narrow fplain, two and a half miles broad, between the
Ganges river and the Khargpur hills, Along this plain runs
the most convenient road trom Patna to Bengal. Shuja had
blocked the road by means of a wall and a ditch running
from the river to the hill, with raised bastions at every thirty
yards’ distance, defended with large guns landed from his
boats and manned by his soldiers.

Early in March Mir Jumla arrived before Mungir, and
finding the main road barred, bribed Rajah Bahroz of
Khargpur and under his guidance carried the imperial army
through the hills and jungles south-east of Mungir fort, thus
turning Shuja’s rear. Thal prince now fled from Mungir (6th
March) to Sahibganj, where he blocked the narrow pass
with a wall ({0th--24th March). But the impetialists won
over Khwajah Kamal Afghan, the zamindar of Birbhum and
Chatnagar, and with, his help and guidance made a detour

tl

round the south-east of the Mungir district and reached Suri
on the 28th.

But a false rumour that Dara had triumphed near Ajmir
and was wreaking vengeance on the Rajput States now
induced the Rajput contingent under Mir Jumia (especialty
the troops of Ram Singh, the eldest son of Jai Singh) to
desert and push on to their distant homes. Thus the pursuing
force lost 4,000 men (30th March), but was still twice as
strong as Shuja’s army.

In the meantime, Shuja had evacuated Sahibganj (97th March)
for Rajmahal ; but finding even Rajmahal unsafe, he retreated
(4th April) to the Malda district. His chief noble Alawardi
Khan, who had planned to desert to Mir Jumla with many
other officers, was beheaded (2nd April), on the detection of his
plot. The imperialists occupied Rajmahal on 13th April, and
thus the whole country west of the Ganges passed out of
Shuja's hands.

The war that now ensued between the two sides was a
curious contest like that between a tiger and a cracodile,
Shuja’s regular troops had by now been reduced to five thousand
men, while Mir Jumla’s army was five times as large and, man
for man, superior in fighting capacity. Shuja was, therefore,
hopelessly inferior on land. But Mir fumla’s army was a
purely land force. He had not, at first, a single boat of his
own for campaigning in this land of waler-ways, and his guns
were fewer and smaller than his enemy's. On the other hand,
Shuja bad an artillery of big pieces admirably served by
European and half-breed gunners. He had the entire flotilla
(nawwara) of Bengal at his disposal for crossing rivers,
transporting his troops, or cannonading the imperial defences
and camp on the river-bank wherever he liked. This arm
gave Shuja wonderful mobility and multiplied the effective
strength of his small army, while the lack of boats paralysed
Mir Jumla’s efforts and neutralized his superiority on land,

f

Shuja, making Tanda (four miles west of the fort of Gaur)
his base, entrenched various places on the eastern bank of the
Ganges to prevent Mir Jumla from crossing over. But his
plans were foiled by Mir Jumla’s wonderful activity in procuring
boats from remote places and Aurangzib's clever  strategical
move in sending another army, under the governor of Patna,
to make a diversion on the left bank of the Ganges and turn
Shuja’s right flank.

From his headquarters at Dogachi, thirteen miles south of
Rajmahal, Mir Jumla struck two successful blows at Shuja. [le
wrested from the enemy, by a night surprise, an island in
midstream, opposite Dogachi, where a detachment of Shuja’'s
men was posted, and he held it against repeated attempts to
recover it, Later, the imperialists surprised ane destroyed a
battery of eight guns which the enemy had erected on the
eastern bank facing Sui.

The imperial army was distributed along the enlire western
bank: Muhammad Murad Beg was left in command at
Rajmahal in the extreme north ; the prince with Zulfiqar Khan,
Islam Khan, and the bulk of the army, remained at Dogachi
13 miles southwards, facing Shujas At Dunapur, some 8 miles
further south, Ali Quli Khan was posted, while Mir Jumia
himself with six or seven thousand troops occupied Suli, the
southernmost point of the Mughal fines, 28 miles south of Rajmahal.

But a third coup planned by Mir Jumla failed with heavy loss,
because this time Shuja was on the alert and had prepared an
ambush. On 3rd May 1659, when only the first part of the
expedition sent by the Mughal general had landed, the men and
their boats were attacked by a superior enemy force which
had been waiting for them in hiding. The imperial detachinent
sactificed in this vain attempt four high officers and many
hundred soldiers, besides 500 left as prisoners, No  succour
could be sent by Mir Jumla from the western bank, as his
boats were afraid to face the Bengal flotilla,

thus won the thoughtless prince over. On hearing the news,
Mir Jumla at Suti firmly kept his own men quiet, and the

them, and restored order and discipline. A council of war
was held; all the other generals agreed to obey him as their
sole head. Thus the army weathered the storm; “it Jost
only one man—the prince.”

Soon afterwards, the torrential rains of Bengal suspended
military operations. Mir Jumla, with about 15,000 men, took
post at Masuma-bazar, while the rest of the tnperial army,
under Zulfiqar Khan, stayed at Rajmahal, the two divisions
being separated by 60 miles of road impassable in that season,

The rains converted the neighbourhood of Rajmahal into
one marshy lake. The citys food supply from the Majwa
hills (in the north-west) was cut off by reason of Shuja
bribing its Rajah ; the waler-route was commanded by Shuja’s
flotilla; and so scarcity of grain reached its extreme among
the Mughal garrison fn Rajmahal. In this situation, Shuja
made a sudden attack with his flotilla and captured the cily
on 22nd Augusl, with all the property of the Mughals.

8 10. The war in Bengal.

At the beginning of December [659 Shuja marched from
Rajmahal with 8,000 men, against Mir Jumla who was
encamped near Belghata, (42 miles southwards, and opposite
Jangipur in the Murshidabad district). Here he twice attacked
the imperialists and did them such damage, on account of


--- Page 103 ---
ST) SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cu.

their marked inferiority in artillery, that Mir Jumla fell back on
Murshidabad, while Shuja marched paralicl to him to Nashipur.
But in the meantime, Daud Khan the governor of Bihar, with a
second army had forced a passage across the Kushi river,
swept away the Shwjaite forces on the north bank of the
Ganges and was in full march on ‘Tanda, On hearing — this
mews Shuja left Nashipur (26 Dec.) and hastened towards Tanda
via Sui. Mir Jumla immediately gave him chase, Shuja
erossed the Ganges at Rajmahal and the imperialists recovered
that city on 11th January 1660. Thus, the whole country
west of the Ganges was finally lost to Shuja.

This year Mir Jumla’s plan of campaign was brilliantly
novel: he would attack the enemy from an unexpected
quarter, the north-east. Shuja’s position now was a long line,
stretching northwest fo south-east from Samda_ island
(opposite Rajmahal) to Tanda, with his headquarters about
the middle of the line at Chauki Mirdadpur. Mir Jumla’s plan
was to make a wide detour in a semi-circle north of this
position, by way of Rajmahal, Akbarpur and Malda, then
turn sharply south and swoop down upon Tanda from the
east. With the help of the 160 boats brought from Patna, he
carried his army over the Ganges, [0 miles north of Rajmahal,
and joined Daud Khan.

Shuja was hopelessly outnumbered from the first, and now
(February 1660) found his only fine of retreat, in the south,
threatened. At this time, Princeg, Muhammad Sultan deserted
him and sneaked back to the Mughal camp at Dogachi (sth
Feb).. He was doomed to pass the rest of his life in prison.

On 6th March Mir Jumla reached Malda and worked hard
for a month to complete his preparations for his crowning
‘stroke which would crush Shuja in one move, From his
headquarters at Mahmudabad (a few miles below Maida
town), he started on Sth April, and after a march of 10 miles
surprised the small enemy patrol at an obscure ford of the


--- Page 104 ---
1660} SHUIA’S FLIGHT, FROM TANDA O7

Mahananda river. Without a moment’s delay, the imperialists
plunged into the waiter; all order was gone and in the
confusion the: shallow ford was missed; vast numbers went
below their depth on both sides of the track, and more than a
thousand soldiers were drowned, including a son of Dilir Khan.

But it was the decisive move of the campaign. All was
now over with Shuja. Ile must immediately flee to Dacca,
before the enemy's net could completely close round him.
He hastened to Tanda at dawn of 6th April and ordered his
Begams to come away at once “without waiting even to change
their dress.” His treasure and a selection from his other property
were loaded in four large boats and sent down the stream.
In the afternoon he himself embarked. His two younger sons,
(Buland Akhtar and Zain-wl-abidin), his chiefs, Mirza Jan Beg,
Sayyid Alam of Barha, Sayyid Quli Uzbak, and Mirza Beg, a
few soldiers, servants, and euntichs,---300 men in all,~accompanied
him in 60 boats (fosas). This was the sole remnant of the
splendid Court amidst which he had ruled three provinces, and
the vast army with which he had twice contested the throne
of Delhi !

Wild terror and confusion now reigned in his camp at
Tanda. His unguarded property was plundered. Next day (7th
April) Mir Jumla occupied the city and restored order. He
seized for the Government all the property he found or could
recover from the plunderers; the women left behind by Shuja
were properly guarded and taken care of. At Tartipur 400
loaded boats of Shuja’s flotilla were seized, besides the two
treasure-laden gfurabs. His army now came over to Mir
Jumla (9th April). Then the general set off from Tanda (19th
April) for Dacca.

8 11. Sfuja abandons Bengal; fis end.

Ch 12th April, Shuja reached Dacca, the second capital of
Bengal, a bankrupt in fame and fortune. But it was to be no

asylum to him. The samindars were all up against him and
he was too weak cither to subdue them or to face Mir Jumla
who was hastening behind him. So, on 6th May: he left Dacca
and glided down the river towards the sea. At every silage
soldiers and boatmen deserted him in large numbers. He had
already begged help from the king of Arracan, and two days
after leaving Dacca he was met by 31 ships sent by that Ring’s
governor of Chatgaon. All hope of maintaining a hold on
Bengal was given up and he steeled his heart fo banish himself
to the land of the savage Maghs,

The news spread consternation among his family and
followers. The piracy of the Arracanese of Chatgaon in the
rivers of East Bengal had made them too well known to the
people. Whole districts in Noakhali and Baqarganj had been
depopulated through their ravages. Their daring attacks,
ferocious cruelty, uncouth appearance, barbarous manners, lack
of religion and caste, and practice of eating unclean animals,—
all caused them to be regarded by the people of East Bengal,
Hindus and Muslims alike, with a mixture of terror and
loathing.

But there was no help for il, if Shuja wanted to avoid the
fate of Dara Shukoh and Murad Balthsh at the hands of
Aurangzib. So, on [9th May 1660, he finally left the home
of his ancestors and the province which he had ruled for
twenty years, and sailed for Arracan with his family and less
than forty followers; ten of these were Sayyids of Barha,
famous throughout India for their valour and devotion to their
master, . ;

Shuja was not happy in his new home. His unquiet ambition
brought down a iragic end upon him. “Many dwellers in
Arracan, Mughal and Pathan,...showed themselves inclined
towards him. He planned an outbreak intending to slay
the king and take his kingdom, and then advance once more
to fest his fortune in Bengal.” ( The king of Arracan heard of

the plot and “planned the assassination of Shah Shuja. Shah
Shuja with a few men fled into the jungle. The Maghs...pursued
the poor prince,..cutting his body into pieces.” (Dutch report,

Feb. 1661). )

CHAPTER VI
THE FIRS! HALF OF THE REIGN: A GENERAL SKETCH

8 1. The contrast between the two fialves of Aurangzib’s
reign ; Ais personal movements.

The reign of Aurangzib is naturally divided into two equal
parts of about 95 years each, the first of which he passed in
Northern India and the second in the Deecan. During the
earlier of these two periods the centre of interest lies unmis-
takably in the North, not because the Emperoi lived there, but
because the most important developments, civil and military,
concerned this region, while the South figured as a far off and
negligible factor. In the second half of the reign the situation
is reversed: all the resources of the empire are concentrated
in the Deccan ; the Emperor, his Court and family, the bulk
of the army, and all his best officers live there for a quarter
century, and Hindustan sinks back to a place of secondary
importance. The generals and soldiers in their enforced exile
in the Deccan sigh for a return to their northern homes; one
homesick noble offers the Emperor a lakh of Rupees for leave
fo spend only one year at Delhi; the Rajput soldiery complain
that their breed is dying out by reason of their lifelong stay
in the Deccan away from home and family. During this period,
praciically extending over one human generation, the administra-
fion in Northern India naturally falls into decay at the with-
drawal of the master’s eye and the ablest officers ; the people
grow poorer; the upper classes decline in morals, intelligence
and useful activity : finally lawlessness breaks out in most parts,


--- Page 108 ---
AURANGZIRA'S PERSONAL MOVEMENTS 104

During the first half of the reign the centre of interes! in
Northern India shifts with startling rapidity and range. The
imperial banners march from Kabul in the extreme west fo
the Namrup hills in the extreme east of India, from Tibet
beyond our northern limits to Bijapur across the southern
boundary of the empire. Many operations on a smaller scale
are cartied out against Jawless peasants and chiefs in several
widely separated districts) We see the Emperor's religious
intolerance fully unmasked during this period.

After his grand coronation at the commencement of the
second year of his reign (13 May, 1659), Aurangzib mostly
lived at Delhi, guiding the State from the capital. At the
capital he received (1661-67) the grand embassies sent from all
parts of the outer Muslim world to wish him well on his
accession. For the benefit of these foreign guests he made
that lavish display of his wealth and power which “dazzled
even eyes which were accustomed to the pomp of Versailles.”
In the Sth year of his reign, Aurangzib made a trip to Kashmir,
leaving Delhi on 8th Dec, 1662 and returning to that city on 18th
Jan. {664 In February 1666 his father's death took him to
Agra. So long as Shah Jahan fived in captivity, Aurangzib
had naturally avoided Agra and held his Court at Delhi.

in 1674 the seriousness of the Afticti rising farced the
Emperor to go to Hasan Abdal, to be near enough to Peshawar
to direct the operations of his armies. Here he lived from
26th June, 1674 to 23rd December, 1675, returning to Delhi on
27th March, 1676. Early in 1679, the death of Maharajah
Jaswant Singh and the opportunity it presented of annexing the
Jodhpur State drew him to Ajmir, In Rajputana he spent the
next two years and then, eatly in the 25th year of his reign,
he started for the Deccan where he finally exhausted his life
and empire after 25 years of strenuous but unavailing toil.

Aurangzib first sat on the ifrone on Ast Ziqada, year 1068
of the Hifera era (21 July, 1658); but his second or grand


--- Page 109 ---
102 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB (cu. VI

coronation took place on 24th Ramzan, 1069 (5 June, 1659).
In the second year it was ordered that in official documents
every year of the reign should be calculated from 1st Ramzan.

Bui it was found inconvenient fo feast and rejoice in a
season of religious fasting and prayer, and so, from the 4th
year onwards the Emperor sat on the throne immediately at
the end of the month of Ramzan, i e, on the day of the
Id-ul-fite, (sometimes a day later), and the celebrations ran on for
10 days from that date. In the 21st year (1677) he abolished ~
the celebrations, the making of presents to him by the nobles,
and all kinds of display at Court on the oceasion of the
coronation anniversary.

§9. Aurangszib’s iliness, 1662.

Early in the 5th year of his reign, Aurangzib had a severe
illness, which was aggravated by his obstinate devotion to work
and religious austeritie. The days of Ramzan (0 April—
9 May, 1662) were extremely hot and long, and overwork
and lack of sleep and proper nourishment during this entire
month of fasting in the daytime in the frightful heat of a
Delhi summer, greatly weakened him. At last on 19th
May, a fever seized him; the doctors bled him so much that
he became extremely weak ; ,at times he fell into fits of
insensibility and a deadly pallor spread over his face. The
greatest anxiety and distraction reigned in the palace and the
capital, and the evil was aggravated by the rival movements of
his sons to gain adherents and secure their own succession.

Up to the 5th day, his fever and weakness continued
without abatement. But such was Aurangzib’s strength of mind
that he showed his face in the Audience Hall for a moment
that evening and the next, leaning on a mace and receiving the ,
presentation of the royal standards. The illness continued for
a month more, but there was no longer any cause for
public alarm or disorder. On Friday the 23rd and 30th


--- Page 110 ---
1663} AURANGZIB’S SEVERE ILLNESS 103

he went to the Jama Mosque in a litter to pray in public.
His complete recovery was celebrated on 94th June. The
absolute peace that was maintained throughout the empire during
this crifical month and a half is the highest tribute to the
strength of Aurangzib’s character* and the stability of the
rule he had founded.

On his recovery, Aurangzib was advised to regain his strength
and refresh his spirits by a visit fo the pleasant valley of
Kashmir, then known as the “Earthly Paradise.” Early in May
1663 he started from Lahor for Kashmir, entering the valley
through the Pir Panjal Pass at Bhimbar. The Court passed
two and a half months most happily at Srinagar. On the
return journey Lahor was reached on 29th Sep. 1663, and
Delhi on 18th January next

During these early years passed at Delhi, when there was
no cloud on the horizon of the frontiers, Aurangzib offen
devoied himself to the pleasures of the chase in the neigh-
bourhood of the capital or in the Doab, though in old age
he condemned sfikar as the business of the idle (6efar).

§ 3. Lawless tisings in the provinces.

Many minor conquesis took place in the outskirts of the
empire during the first quarter-century of Aurangzib’s reign ;
such as Palamau (south of Bihar), Assam and Kuch Bihar
(both abandoned), Idar, Chatgaon, and Tibet (in 1665, amoun-
fing only to the acknowledgment of the Emperor’s suzerainty
by the Buddhist ruler of that country. This country was
evidently Ladak or Little Tibet).

The disturbances of internal peace in Aurangzib’s reign
were of three classes: (@) The outbreaks inevitable during a

* Bernier’s Agfa (Danishmand Khan) on hearing of Aurangsib’s fortitude during
illness, exclaimed, “What strength of mind! What invincible courage! Heaven
preserve thee, Atirang2ib, for greater achievements! Thou art nat yet destined to
die P? (B. t25),


--- Page 111 ---
104 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cx. VI

succession dispute among the princes, when the collapse of
civil authority tempts  plunderers and ambitious chiefs to
entich themselves by lawless acts withoul fear of punishment.
(6) Hindu risings against the policy of temple destruction
which began to be enforced throughout the empire in the
12th year. (c) Revolts of vassal princes. We have also a
few sporadic cases of defiance of imperial authority by petty
chieftains in out-of-the-way or jungly places.

The Hindu revolts provoked by Aurangzib’s bigotry,
as well his dealings with the Sikhs, will be treated in detail in a
subsequent chapter.

Some local disturbances were also caused by pretenders
setting up for his dead brothers or nephews. A false Dara
Shukoh appeared in Gujrat in August 1663, a false Shuja in
the Morang hills (west of Kuch Bihar) in May 1669, a second
in the Yusufzai country in 1674, and a third in Kamraj (Kashmir)
as late as 1707 ; a bogus Buland Alshtar (second son of Shuja)
in the Allahabad province in July 1699, and a counterfeit of the
rebel prince Akbar in the Deccan in March of the same year,

Rao Karan of the Bhurtiya clan, the chieftain of Bikanir,
had served in the Mughal army of the Deccan in the last year
of Shah Jahan’s reign, but had come back to Northern India
at Dara’s instigation without taking Aurangzib’s leave. Afterwards
he had put off paying the customary visit of respect 1o the new
Emperor. So, in August, 1660, an army, 9,000 strong, was sent
under Amir Khan to bring him to reason. Rao Karan was cowed
into submission, waited on the Emperor (27 Nov.) and received
his pardon.

The next lawless Rajah to feel Aurangzib's heavy hand was
Champat Rai Bundela. After the war of 1635 the family of
Bir Singh Dev was dispossessed and the throne of Urchha
given to Devi Singh, a descendant of his eldest brother. Bul
a family sprung from a younger brother of Bir Singh’s father
ruled as the lords of Mahewa in Eastern Bundelkhand. Their


--- Page 112 ---
{661] CHAMPAT BUNDELA HUNTED TO DEATH 105

leader was Champat Rai When Aurangsib reached Ujjain
after his viclory over Jaswant, Champat Rai joined him.
But when Shuja was advancing to Khajwa and the wildest
rumours spread through the empire, Champat deserted, and
returning home took to his old game of robbery. The
Emperor sent an army under Subhkaran Bundela and other
Rajput officers against the rebel (10 Feb., 1659). A contingent
under Rajah Devi Singh Bundela and the jagirdars and local
troops of Malwa were ordered to assist him. Everybody’s
hands were now turned against Champat, who fled from place
to place closely followed by the imperialists.

At last about the middle of October 1661, Champat Rai
finding capture by his false friends imminent, and unable to
defend himself in the extreme agony of fever and weakness,
stabbed himself to death, and so also did his constant
companion in life, Rani Kali Kumari. But his son Chhattra Sal
lived to be long a thorn in the sides of the Mughals and finally.
to found a new kingdom, Panna, in Eastern Bundelkhand.

§ 4. Conquest of Palamau, etc.

Beyond the southern limils of Bihar lies the district of
Palamau as a sort of rugged step leading to the plaleau of
Chota Nagpur on the south-east and the Central Provinces on
the southwest. It is a wild country, broken up by spurs and
peaks, with many rainy-weather rivers unfil for navigation
and yielding no assured supply of water for irrigation. The
southern part of the district is extremely rocky barren and
jungly ; in the northern part the valleys are a litle wider and
more fertile ; but “nowhere in the district is it possible to get
more than six or seven miles from a well-defined hill. There
are no level plains, and the general appearance of the district
is that of a confused mass of rocky hills, mostly covered by
a dense growth of jungle. From the summit of a ridge or hill,


--- Page 113 ---
{06 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB cu. VI

the country appears covered by a waving sheet of low forest,
with all signs of human habitation concealed from view, except
perhaps a glimpse here and there of a low red tiled roof, a
distant grove of trees, or an occasional herd of cattle” The
population is scanty, living in small and scattered villages
embosomed in the hollows among the hills.

The dominant clan of the district in the {7th and 18th
centuries were the Cheros, a Dravidian people, said to have
branched off from the Rajbhant tribe. In 1643, the Mughals
taking advantage of family disputes, reduced Rajah Pratap
Chero to the status of a Mughal mansabdac, and turned his
ancestral kingdom into a fief, subject to an annual payment
of one lakh of Rupees. The tribute was exorbitant in amount,
and beyond the power of the Rajah to pay regularly. It
naturally fell into arrears, while additional provocation was
given by the catile-raids of the Cheros across the Bihar
frontier every year,

By order of the Emperor, Daud Khan the governor of
Bihar invaded Palamau in April 1661. He easily occttpied the
forts of Kuthi, Kunda, and Deogan which guarded the northern
frontier of that kingdom, and advanced cutting the jungle and
making a toad towards the capital. On 7th December he
attacked the enemy’s trenches two miles before Palamau, and
after a severe fight for three days put the Chero army to flight.
Then a path was cleared with great labour through the remain-
ing two miles of jungle, and the Mughals attacked the Rajah’s
trenches before his capital on the 15th. After a stubborn fight
for six hours, the enemy fled into the city, which was immediately
stormed by the exultant Mughals. At night the Rajah
escaped from his fort, which was seized by the Mughals next
day. Palamaut was annexed to the subafi of Bihar,

In 1662, a disputed succession in Nawanagar, the capital of
the State of Halar in northwestern Kathiawad, led to the
Mughal suzerain’s intervention. The faujdar of Junagarh, after

a stubborn fight with the usurper in which the imperialists lost
611 men in killed and wounded (13 Feb. 1663), slew the
usurper and restored the rightful heir to the throne. But the
peninsula long continued unsettled,

In 1664 two forces were sent from Darbhanga and Gorakh-
pur to co-operate in chastising the rebel Rajah of Morang {a
hill country west of Kuch Bihar and north of the Purnea
district). Early in 1676 we read of Morang being conquered
anew.

A punitive expedition visited the Kumatin hills, the dominion
ot Rajah Bahadur Chand, in 1665, After a long contest, the
Rajah secured his pardon in 1673.

aA $ 5. . Abolition of duties on grain ; Emperor’s
. Leo Istamic ordinances.

Immediately affer his second enthronement, Aurangzib fook
two measures which had become presssing necessities. During
the War of Succession the economic ruin of many parts of
Northern India was complete, and grain was selling at famine
prices. The evil was aggravated by the inland transit duties;
at every ford, ferry, hill pass or provineial boundary, cafdari
or toll of one-tenth of the value of the goods was taken on
‘the passing merchandise as wages for guarding the roads. In
the jarger towns, like Agra, Delhi, Lahor, and Burhanpur, a duty
{ealled pandari) was levied on all articles of food and drink
brought from outside for sale, Aurangzib abolished both
the cafidari and the pandaré in the Crownlands and
requested the jagirdars and zamindars to do the same in
their estates, This was done, and there was a free flow of
corn to every place affected by scarcity, and the price of grain
fell appreciably. A large number of cesses (abwads), many of
them trivial and vexatious, were abolished by Aurangzib in
1673, [See my Mughal Administration, Ch. 5.) The océroi
duty on tobacco was abolished in 1666.


--- Page 115 ---
108 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cu. VI

Aurangzib had claimed the throne as the champion of pure
Islam against the heretical practices and principles of Dara
Shukoh. Soon affer his second coronation (June, 1639) he
issued the following ordinances to restore the rules of orthodox
Islam and to bring the lives of the people into closer accord
with the teaching of the Quran.

(1) The Mughal emperors before him used to stamp the
Muhammadan confession of faith (4alfma) on their coins.
Aurangzib forbade it.

(2) The ancient kings of Persia, and following them the
Muslim rulers of that country as well as the Mughal sovereigns
of India, used to observe the day when the Sun enters the
Aries as an occasion of general rejoicing and carnival at
Court because it was the New Year’s Day (nautoz) of the
Zoroastrian calendar (ist of Farwardin), Aturangzib forbade
the keeping of the day and transferred the customary Nauroz
rejoicings of {the Court to the coronation festivity following the
month of Ramzan.

(3) A Censor of Morals (muftastb) was appointed to enforce
the Prophet’s laws and putdown the practices forbidden by him,
such as drinking distilled spirits or fermented beer, fang and
other liquid intoxicants, gambling, and, the illicit commerce of
the sexes. Opium and ganja, however, were not interclicted.
The punishment of heretical opinions, blasphemy and omission
of prayer and fast by Muslims also lay within the province
of this Inquisition. A party of mansahdars and afadis was
posted under him fo enforce his orders.

(4) An imperial circular, dated 13th May 1659, was
sent fo all the provinces, forbidding the cultivation of
bbang. ,

(5) Ail the old mosques and monasteries, many of which had
become mere ruins, wete repaired, and (mams, muazzins, khatibs:
and attendants were appointed in them with regular salaries,

His puritanical rigour grew with age. We may conveniently


--- Page 116 ---
AURANGZIB’S PURITANICAL REGULATIONS 109

study here his meastres for enforcing his own ideas of the
morose seriousness of life ;

(6) At the commencement of the 11th year of his reign,
he forbade the Court musicians to perform before him.
“Gradually music was tolfally forbidden at Court.”

The sons of the Muses took their revenge by turning the
public laughter against their crowned foe. About one thousand
of the musicians of Delhi assembled on a Friday when
Aurangzib was going to the mosque. They came out with over
. twenty highly ornamented biers, as is the customof the country,
crying aloud with great grief From afar Aurangzib saw this
multitude and heard their great weeping and lamentation, and
wondering, sent to know the cause of so much sorrow. The
musicians replied with sobs that the king’s orders had killed
Music, therefore they were bearing her to the grave, The king
calmly remarked that they should see that she was thoroughly
well buried !

(7) The ceremony of weighing the Emperor against gold
antl silver on his two birthdays (according to the lunar and
solar calendars) was stopped.

(8) In 1668, the two stone elephants placed by Jahangir on
the two side-pillars of the Hatipul gate of Agra fort, were
removed by the Emperor.

(9) In April 1670, the courtiers were ordered to give up
the Hindu practice of saluting» each other by raising the hand
to the head and to confine themselves to the ery ‘Peace be on
you ? (salam alekurm.)

(40) In March 1670 he forbade the festivilies which used to
be held on his birthday; henceforth the royal band was to
play for three hours only instead of the whole day, Early in
the 91st year of his reign (November, 1677) the customary
rejoicings on the anniversary of his coronation were abolished.

(44) It had formerly been the practice of the emperors to
apply a spot of paint (fifa) with their own fingers to the

*


--- Page 117 ---
110 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cu. VI

forehead of great Rajahs when investing them. In May 1679
the ceremony was altogether abolished as savouring of
Hinduism.

(42) Aurangzib gave up the ceremony of darshan or
appearing every morning at a balcony on the wall of the
palace to receive the salute of the people assembled on the
ground outside-—-which Akbar had introduced and his successors
had hitherto practised. It was akin to the Hindu practice of
having a look at one’s tutelary idol before beginning the
day’s work.

(43) The roofing over of buildings containing tombs, the
lime-washing of sepulchres, and the pilgrimage of women to
the graveyards of saints, were forbidden, as opposed to
the Quranic law.

But his attempt to elevate mankind by one tfeap failed, and
the administration made itself ridiculous by violently enforcing
for a time, then relaxing, and finally abandoning a code of
puritanical morals opposed to the feelings of the entire popula-
tion, without first trying to educate them to a higher level of
thought. As Manucci noticed, “It was so common to drink
spirits when Aurangsib ascended the throne, that one day he
said in a passion thai in all Hindustan no more than two men
could be found who did net drink, namely himself and the
Chief Qazi. The regulations were strict at first, but litle by
little they were relaxed,..there being few who do not drink
secreily..The ministers themselves drank and loved to get
drunk.” So, too, in the case of the order against music.

Notorious instances of gambling were ptnished by the
Emperor. Manucci mentions that he ordered all the public
women and dancing-girls to marry or leave the realm; but
fhe same writer’s narrative shows that this rule was a dead
letter. His prohibition of the Aolf celebration in the streets,
when obscene songs were sung and faggot was extorted
from all people for bonfires, was clearly a police regulation,


--- Page 118 ---
{66{] SARMAD ‘THE MYSTIC BEHEADED {it

So, also, was the order putting a stop to Muharram processions
in future, after a deadly fight between rival processionists at
Burhanpur in 1669,

In 1664 Aurangsib issued an order forbidding the burning
of Hindu widows with their husbands’ corpses. But
Government was powerless -to enforce the prohibition
everywhere. The inhuman practice of castrating children with
a view to selling them as slaves, was ordered to be suppressed
({668) throughout the empire.

86. Persecution of Dara’s favourite theologians
and of heretics.

The enforcement of Islamic orthodoxy gave Aurangzib
an opportunity for punishing those liberal holy men of his
creed whom Dara had favoured. One such was Shah
Muhammad Badakhshi, a disciple of Mian Mir and a facile
composer of mystic poetry. Dara had greatly honoured and
cherished him, and, therefore, after Aurangzib’s accession he
was summoned to the imperial presence. But on the way
he died at Lahor in 1661.

But the most notable victim of this class was Sarmad, a
Sufi of the highest celebrity in India. This man was born of
Jewish parents at Kashan in Persia and made himself a

Scriptures. Then he embraced Islam under the name of
Muhammad Said, and afler coming to India as a trader, met
at Tatta a Hindu lad named Abhay Chand, with wham he
was so infatuated that he became a naked fagir and induced
Abhay Chand to be his disciple. At Delhi, he was made
much of by Dara Shukoh and even introduced fo Shah Jahan.

Sarmad was a pantheist, and his smooth flowing verses

af sects and adores the truth inherent in all creeds, His
attitude to Muhammad was one of deep respect; but on
several points of Muslim theology and tradition his opinions
were unorthodox. “God,” he held, “is a material substance ...
and His materiality is symbolized by a human figure and
body...The reward of good deeds and_ the punishment af
sins take place in ¢Aés world. A man’s soul is born again
after a period of sleep exactly as long as his last life.”

Sarmad used to go about stark naked. As an
uncompromising Monist, he denied the existence of Matter
and felt no shame about anything pertaining to his body.

A bench of Muslim theologians sat in judgment over
Sarmad and sentenced him to death on account of heresy.
The real reason was political, as he is said to have assured
Dara of success in contesting the throne.

In 1672, a Shia officer (dévan) named Muhammad Tahir
was beheaded for cursing the first three Khalifs. In 1667, a
Portuguese friar who had embraced Islam and then reverted
to his former faith, was killed at Aurangabad for apostacy.
The spiritual guide of the Bohra sect, Sayyid Qutb-ud-din of
Ahmadabad, is said to have been put to death with 700
of his followers, by order of Aurangzib.

87. Aurangzit’'s relations with the outer Muslim world.

After he was firmly seated on the throne, Aurangzib
received a succession of embassies from all the Muhammadan
States which had trade relations with India, to congratulate
him on his accession.

After the War of Succession, he planned to drown in a
shower of gold any scraples which the headmen and
theologians of the Holy City might have felt in acknowledging
as lawful sovereign the usurper of a loving father’s throne
In November, 1659, shortly after his grand coronation, he
despatched Sayyid Mir Ibrahim, with six lakhs and sixty

thousand Rupees for distribution among the Sayyids, recluses,
gervitors of the mosques and shrines, and devotees at Mecca
and Medina. Thereafter agents of the Sharif used to visit
the Delhi Court every year and levy contributions in the
name of the Prophet. But at fast ihe Sharif’s orved made
Aurangzib turn against him. In the last decade of his eign
he wrole to his waxér, “The Sharif of Mecca, having heard of
the great. wealth of India, sends an envoy every year for
mahine his own gain. The money that | send there is meant
far the poor and not for Aim.”

Atter Aurangzib had mace himself undisputed master of
the throne, Shah Abbas H. sent a grand embassy under Budaq
Beg, the caplain of his muskcteers, to congratulate him (1661),

The Persians have been rightly called the Frenchmen of
Asia. Their country has been the spring-heac of the culture
thought and fashion of the entire Islamic world. Persian
influence has moulded the poetry of all Muslim lands, and
Persian manners and laste have been laboriously, if sometimes
clumsily, imitaled by all Muhammadan Coutts from Cordova
and Constantinople to Delhi and Seringapatam. Kings
have dreaded the sharpness of a Persian  satirist's pen
more than their enemies’ swords) The news that a
Persian mission was coming caused a flutter in the
Mughal Court Every one from the Emperor down to
the meanest guardsman felt that he and his country
were on their trial His manners and conduct would be
judged by the masters of social decorum in all Asia, and if
he was found wanting in correctness of taste and proper dignity
in the least particular, he would be made the laughing-siock
of the entire Muslim world,

The presents from the Shah were worth Rs. 4,292,000. On
97 July 1661 the envoy was given leave to depart On him
and his entourage the Emperor conferred giffs worth
Rs. 3,35,000. A return embassy charged with a reply to Shah

Abbas’s letter, was sent under Tarbiyat Khan, the governor of
Multan, on @nd November 1663, with presents worth more
than seven Jakhs of Rupees, and a letter in which Aurangezib
thanked the Shah for his friendly views, but declared in a
lofty fone that he needed no man’s help as he depended
solely on God's favour; his astonishing victories were a
proof of God's abounding grace on him. Then he naturally
glided into a long and exultant narrative of his triumphs over
his brothers. The Mughal envoy hac audience of the Shah
al Isfahan, but he was very rudely treated and subjected lo
much humiliation and suffering. The Persian king often
uttered threals of invading India in his presence. It was
probably at this time that he sent Aurangzib a long letter
composed by Mirza Tahir Wahid, vigorously defending the
Shia religion, glorifying the Persian royal house, sneering at
Aurangsib, and bragging of his own success as a ruler anid
defender of the true faith !

At last after a year’s stay in Persia, Tarbiyat Khan was
given conge (1666) and entrusted with a taunting letter for
Aurangzib. In it Shah Abbas writes, “J learn that most of the
gamindars of India are in rebellion because their culer is
weak, incompetent and without resources. The chief of
them is the impious kafir Shiva, who had long lived in such
obscurity that none knew of his name; but now, taking
advantage of your Jack of means and the retreat of your
iroops, he has made himself visible like the peak of a mountain,
seized many forts, slain or captured many of your
soldiers, occupied much of that country, plundered and wasted
many of your ports, cities and villages, and finally wants to

are in distress, it is my royal aim to go personally to India

my desire), give you every help and extinguish the fire of
disorder.” Aurangzib vented his impotent rage on the innocent
envoy, accused him of having failed in his duty, denied him
audience, and degraded him in rank.

This Shah died in August 1667, and the threatened Persian
invasion of India ended in words, though Aurangzib kept a
vigilant eye on his Persian frontier to the end of his fife.
Other embassies to Aurangzib came from Balkh and Bukhara
(14661 and again in 1667), Kashghar (1664), Uroanj (Shiva),
Constantinople (1690), and Abyssinia (1663 and again in 1671).
The Delhi Government had also friendly intercourse with
several petty chiefs of Arabia and Central Asia, as well as the
Turkish governors of Basra.

In the space of less than seven years (1661-67), Aurangzib
spent over 21 lakhs of Rupees in receiving and sendine out
these embassies, besides i1 lakhs given to Abdullah Khan, the
ex-King of Kashghar, who fook refuge in India in 1668,

When Shah Jahan opened the gates of Agra fort to his
victorious son, he became a prisoner for the rest of his life.
Tore “King of Kings” the change was very bilfer indeed, and
it was only after many a siruggle that he accepied it
The fetters that he wrote to Dara and Shuja were intercepted

these futile tempts was to tighten the bonds of, his captivity.


--- Page 123 ---
116 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIP [cu. VI

Shab fahan was now completely ringed round by enemics. No
one could interview him. Every remark made by the captive
was promptly reported to Aurangzib by official spies. Even
weiting materials were withheld from the ex-Emperor.

The fall of the most magnificent of the Great Mughals was
robbed of dignity by Aurangzib’s insatiable cupidity, which ted to
many sordid wrangles bekween father and son for the possession
of the crown jewels worn by Shah Jahan or kept in Agra fort.
The captive Emperor could never forget that he was their
lawful owner and that his son was an wusurper without any
moral right to State property. To this argument Aurangzib
replied, “The royal property and treasures exist for the good
of the community, because these pay no tithe...The king is only
God’s chosen custodian and the trustee of God’s money for
the benefit of the people.” All the crown property in Agra
fort, therefore, belonged to him as the reigning sovereign.

Dara al the time of his flight had deposited 927 lakhs of
Rupees worth of jewels, belonging to his wives and daughters,
in Agra fort. Aurangzib demanded their surrender, Shah
Jahan Jong resisted, but at last he yielded them up. Again,
Aurangzib demanded that Dara’s women singers should be sent
to him. Immediately after the capitulation of Agra fort (8th June
1658}, Aurangzib had sealed up all the rooms of royal apparel,
furniture, plate, jewels and treasure. All the property was
ordered fo be “alfached strictly and with every possible care.”

On the departure of Muhammad Sultan, the eunuch Mutamad
became all in all and treated Shah Jahan with great harshness
and neslect. “He sometimes allowed it to be seen that he
treated Shah Jahan as a miserable slave.”

During the first year of his captivity a very acrimonious
correspondence passed between father and son. Throughout
the controversy Aurangzib poses as the champion of Islam and
good government, as the humble instrument of God in the work
of teform and popular beneficence; he condetuns his father’s

1659] BITTER LLTTERS TO SHAN JANAN 117
rs

incompetence and unjust rule, and defends his own conduct
with all the mingled self-righteousness and affected humility of
a Pharisee. To the charge of being an unnatural son and a
a rebel, he replies thus :

“So long as you held the reins of government, | never did
anything without your permission, nor did I ever step beyond my
jurisdiction. During your illness Dara usurped all power, girt
up his loins to promote JTinduism and destroy Islam, and
acted as king, totally setting you aside. The government fell
into disorder....My march on Agra was not due to a rebel-
Hious spirit, but to a desire to put an end to Dara’s usurpation,
his lapse from Islam and his exaltation of idolatry throughout
the empire.....f was compelled, out of regard for the next world,
fo take up the perilous load of the crown, out of sheer necessity
and not from free choice—for restoring peace and the rules
of Islam in the realm.”

His own idea of the Ring’s position and duty is high, even
stoical: “Kingship means the projection of the realm and the
guardianship (of the people), and not the enjoyment of bodily
repose or the lusts of the flesh.”

Ile points exultantly to his own success against heavy odds,
as a proof of God’s favour to him and of the righteousness
of his cause. Shah Jahan, therefore, as a wise man must
subinit to the divine dispensation and accept Aurangzib’s triumph
as the best thing that could have happened to him |

In utter scorn for such hypocrisy, Shah Jahan taunted
Aurangzib with being a robber of other peaple’s property, while
professing to be a itue Musalman. The prince defended his
conduct in a loliy strain of idealism: “You have written that
it is contrary to the Muslim faith ta seize another's property.
Know that the royal property and treastes exist for the good
of the people....A kingdom is not hereditary private propery.
The king is merely God's elected custodian and trustee of, His
money for the good of the subjecis.”


--- Page 125 ---
{18 SHORT HISTORY OF \WURANOZIP Icu, Vf

Next, Shah Jahan warned his cruel son to remember that
fis sons might treat him as he had treated his own father.
Aurangzib’s reply breathes the confident self-righteousness of
the Pharisee: “Well, nothing happens without God's will.
The fate that you have mentioned overtook (my) elders also.
How can [ escape from the dispensations of Providence ? Every
One gets from God a return according to his own intentions,
and as my intentions are good, | believe that | shall not get
anything but good [from my sons}.”

But Shah Jahan was a truer prophet than his boaslful son.
The Nemesis of Aurangzib came in the person of his fourth son
Muhammad Akbar. When that prince rebelled in 1681, he
addressed a bitter and taunting letter to his father, which bears
a siriking similarity to Auranggib's present letters to Shah
Jahan. In it Aurangsib is taxed with administrative failure
and advised to pass his old age in religious meditation as an
atonement for the sin of having deposed his father
and murdered two of his brothers. And finally, Aurangzib
is asked, with what propriety he could tax Akbar with being
an unnaitiral son when he himself had rebelled against
his own father |

The correspondence between Shah Jahan and his son became
intolerably bitter. At last the old monarch bowed to the
inevitable and like a child that cries itself to sleep, he ceased
to complain.

Blow after blow fell on his. stricken heart. First Dara
Shukoh, then Murad Bakhsh, then Sulaiman Shukoh,
were done to death by Aurangzib. Shuja and all
his children were driven to destruction among the unknown
horrors of the land of the Maghs. “But in spite of these
calamities, he never lost patience or thankfulness to God ; to the
last day his heart was the hame of endurance and steadiness.”

Religion gave him solace. His constant companion now
was Sayyid Muhammad of Qanauj. This pious man officiated

as his chaplain, leclor and almoner, “All the ex-Emperor's
time was divided between (professing) obedience to God,
prayer, performance of the obligatory religious services with
all the sunun, reading the Quran, or listening to the histories
of the great men of the past”

Another no less saintly bul more tender comforter he had
in his daughter Jahanara, whose loving care atoned for the
eruclty of all his other offspring. This princess, a disciple of
the saint Mian Mir, now practically led the life of a nun in the
harem of Agra fort, nursing her aged and forlorn father with
the devotion o!f a mother and daughter in one, while she
also Jooked after the orphan daughters of Dara and Murad
whom she had gathered under her projecting wings. In such
spiritual company, Shah Jahan prepared himself for the better
land. Death fost its terrors in his eyes, and even appeared
as a welcome release from misery.

§ 9. Shab Jahan’s last illness and death.

That deliverance, so wistfully desired but so calmly waited
for, came in January 1666, On the 7th of that month, Shah
Jahan was seized with a fever. Soon other complications
appeared, [He had now completed 74 years of age and had
gone through much hardship before his accession to the throne.
The intense cold of midwinter lowered his vitality,

Barly in the aight of Monday, 28nd January, his condition
was declarect hopeless and the end was expected any moment.
At the news that death was near, Shah Jahan thanked God for
all the gifls and favours received in life and proclaimed his
resignation to the will of his Maker. With perfect composure,
he gave directions for his funeral, offered consolation to his
surviving wives, Akbarabadi Mahal and Fathpuri Mahal, his
eldest daughter Jahanara, and the other ladies of the harem,

120 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB fou. VI

who were weeping around his bed, and charged Jahanara to
fook after her half-sister Purhunar Banu and other women
whom his death would leave helpless. Next, he made his will,
took leave of his family and servants, giving them his last
presents and keepsakes, and ordered the Quran to be read-
Finally, while the sacred verses were being solemnly intoned,
amidst the wail of the women and the sobs of his attendants,
Shah Jahan, vetaining full consciousness to the last and gazing
on the resting-place of his beloved and long-lost Mumtaz
Mahal, repeated the Muslim confession of faith, and murmured
the prayer,

“OQ God! make my condition good in this world and the

next, and save me from the torments of hell-fire ?’

A moment later he sank peacefully into eternal rest. It was
a quarter past seven in the evening.

The body lay in the octagonal tower (Musamman Burj)
where life had departed, in full view of the Taj Mahal, where
he wished his mortal remains to mingle with those of his
queen.

The officers in the fort broke open the door at the base
of staircase of the tower, which had been walled up during
Shah Jahan’s captivity, and took the coffin out

Then, conveying the coffin over the Jamuna in a boat,
they reached the Taj Mahal, and buried him by the side of all
that remained on earth of his consort Mumtaz Mahal.

The public grief at the death of Shah Jahan was universal
and sincere. All his virtues were told over again and his few
faults forgotten. .

Nearly a month after the event Aurangzib came fo Agra
and visited Jahanara, whom he showed every courtesy ancl
favour, During the last days of Shah Jahan, her entreaties hacl
conquered his just resentment and he hadi at last signed,
after many previous refusals, a pardon to Aurangzib for
the wrongs he had done io his father.

CHAPTER Vi
WARS ON THE PRONTIERS: ASSAM AND AFGHANISTAN

Sol. Mughal celations wit Kuch Bihar and
Assan befote 1658,

Barly in the 16th century, a Mongoloid soldier of fortune
named Vishwa Singh (reien 1515-1540) founded a dynasty
which still rules over Kuch Bihar. He adopted the Hindu
religion and Hindu culture and ably oreanized his administra-
tion and army. His eldest son and = suecessor Nara Narayan
(re, (540-1584) was a saintly recluse; but Raghaley, the san
ot this king's younger brother, forced him to instal him as
king over Kamrup or the caslern Kuch country, fying belween
the rivers Sankosh and Bar Nadi, which the Muslim historians
call the province of Kuch Hajo and which now forms the
Goalpara and Kamrup districts of Western Assam. Raghudey’s
son Parikshit attacked Lakshmi Narayan, ihe successor of
Nara Narayan, who sought the aid of the Mughal governor
of Bengal. The Muslim army conquered and annexed Kuch
Hajo (£612), and thus {he imperial frontier was carried up
to the Bar Nadi on the north-east, and the Mughal Government
came into contact with the Ahom kings who ruled over
central and castern Assam across that stream.

The Aboms were a branch of the Shan trace, whose
eradle was the hilly region lying north and east of Upper
Burma. In the 13th century a prince of their ancient kingdom
of Pong established himself in the se. corner of the
Brahmaputra valley, He then advanced westwards, conquering
the tribes on the way. The Ahoms were a hardy race of
demon-worshippers, eating beef and fowl and drinking

spirituous liquor, with the Burmese experlness in building
stockades and bamboo-bridges, plying boats and make night
altacks. They were feudally organized under a number of
noblemen (called Gofains, Baruas, and Phukans). The nobles
cultivated their estates by slave labour. ‘The entire adult male
population was liable to military service. ‘Their army cansisted
entirely of loot-soldiers, stiffened by elephants.

The king was the patriarch of the clan, and was venerated
as a sem-civine being anc the custoctian of the tutelary god
of the Iribe (Somdeo). Ahom punishments were draconic,
nen being pul lo death with torlure for the slightest fault.

But in the course of their stay in Assam, the Ahoms
began te change under the influence of Indian civilization and
the Tindu religion. UWindt priests and artisans had entered
Assam in the train of the queens of the Kuch race. Victory
in wars with the Pathan Sultans of Benegal had led to the
Ahowws tearning the use of fire-arms, and fo the settlement
of large numbers of eaplive Bengalis (mostly Muhammadans)
in the country. Lastly, the Vaishnav religion was preached
by Shankardev and other saints, and if made great progress
in the land,

The weal point of the Ahom kingdom was ils diversity of
population. The dominant race was the Ahoms. The middle
stratum of the population was composed of the Assamese
proper,—-plainsmen wilh many Bengal affinities, defective in
physical strength, endturanee and martial spiril. At the bottom
of sociely lay a vast bocly of slaves, some being Mongoloid
serfs, but most being Bengali prisoners of war, These fast
were unwilling dwellers in {he land.

Lariy in the {7th century, the Mughals, after annexing
Kuch Hajo (1612), had a long war with the Ahoms, who had
harboured a prince of the deposed dynasty. At last in 1638
a peace was made, by which the Muhammadans were allowed
to velain the country west of the Bar Nadi in the north

south of that great river. This peace lasled for 20 years.

$2, Apom conquest of Kaimritp, 1058.

But when in 1657 Shuja set out with most of the troops
of Bengal to contest the throne, Pran Narayan, the Rajah of
Kuch Bihar, took advantage of the defenccless stale of the
province, and sent an army under his war Bhabanath to
arrest an obnoxious vassal who had fled ta Mughal — territory
(Hajo). At the same time the Ahom viceroy of the west was
makiny preparations for entering Mughal Kamrup. Mir Lutfullah

anc knowing help from Bengal to be impossible, Ted by beal
to Dacea. The Assamese occupied Gauhati, lhe capital of
Kamrup without a blow, and plundered all the movable and
immovable things in iL

This happened early in (658. But by June 1640 the
civil war was finally over, and Mir Jumla was appointed
viceroy of Bengal with orders to “punish the lawless samindars
of the province, especially these of Assam and Maeh (Arracan).”

$35. Mir Jamla conquers Kuch Bifar and Assam.

On {st November, (461, the viceroy  slariect from Dacca
with an army of [2,000 horse, and 30,000 foat. A vast flotilla
of war-vessels (at least 393 boats of all kinds) accompanied
him,—the most powerful of — them being gfuraby or floating
batteries, each towed by four long row-bdats (called foses)
and carrying 14 suns and a crew of GO men.

Mir Jumla made his way into Kuch Bihar by an obscure
and neglected highway. In six days the Mughal army reached
the capital (19th December), which had been deserled by the
Rajah and his people in terror, The name of the town was

changed to Alamvirnagar; a mosque was built by demolishing
the principal lempte, and the whole kingdom was annexed
to the Muchal empire.

Atter a {6 days’ stay the general left Kuch Bihar (4th
January, (669), and invaded Assam. “On accotint of the
jungles and numerous nalys the daily progress did not exceed
4oor 5 niles.” [Tis men had to go through unspeakable
fatwue. The Ahom army, devastated by cholera, offered a
feeble resistance, always retreating before the invaders or
being rouled with heavy slaughter The Muslims advanced
vicloriously up the Brahmapulra, carrying all the slockades,
trenches and holes full of bamboo spikes on the way. Fort
alter tort was oecupied,-—logigupha at the mouth of the
Monas river (20th January), Gauhati, Srighat at the mouth
of the Bar Nadi (Sth Peb.), Pandu, Beltala, Kajali at the
moulh of the Kallang, Samdhara at the mouth of the Bhatali
river and Simla-earh opposite to it on the south bank of the
Brahmaputea, (Sth February). The Ahom fleet tried its
fortune against the Mughal navy in the night of Srd March,
when Mir Jumla annihilated the enemy's naval power and
seized 300 boats.

The juvaders reached Garhgaon on 17th March. Its Rajah
Jayadhwaj had fled away, abandoning his capital and all his
property, The spoils taken in Assani were enormous :—~82
elephauts, 3 lakhs of Rupees in cash, 675 pieces of artillery,
1345 camel-swivels, 1200  Ramchangis, 6750 matchlocks,
340 maunds of gunpowder, a thousand and odd boats, and
(73 storehouses of paddy, each containing from 16 to 1000
maunds of grain.

Mir Jumla now made his arrangements for going tuto
eantonmenis and keeping hold of the conquered couniry
during the coming rainy season. Ovwing to the shallowness
of the iver near the capilal, the Mughal fleet couid nol sail
up to that town, but had to halt some 18 miles north-west of

i al Lakhau. The general with the main army went into
quarters at Mathurapur, a village lying on a high ground,
seven miles s-c. of  Garhgaon (Gist March) The Ahom
capital, containing all the actllery, elephants, stores and property
of the Mughal army, was held by a_ slrone garrison under
Mir Murtaza. Many outposts were set up.

The enemy’s forces were thus distributed: the Bar Gohain
aceupied the mountains south of Garhgaon, most of the other
nobles with their followers lived in the huge island of Majuli,
formed by the fork of the Brahmaputra and the Dihing, while
the Rajah fled to Namrup, the easternmost province of his

deminion.

§ 4. Constant fighting with Ahoms ; Magfals isolated
during the rainy season.

Bul there was no repese in the Mughal outposts even from
ihe firs The Ahoms soon resumed the offensive, maling
night attacks on the outposls. Even Gathgaon was assaulted ;
but the attempt failed. arly in May, the rains came down
in torrents, the rivers rose in flood, lhe movement of troops
by land became impossible, and lhe imperial outposis were
isolated. In fact, during the whole rainy season, from the
beginning of May to near the end of October, the Mughal
army in Assam lived in a stale of siege. [ach of its posts
stood like an island surrounded by water, and no provision
could come Irom the fleet at Lakhau because the river of
Garhgaon was not deep enough for the large armed boats,
while the small trading vessels could nof safely ply on it so
long as the Ahom = entrenchmenls on ils banks were not
carried,

For lack of proper fool, cavalty horses and draught
cattle perished by the thousand. No supplies of any kind,
not even news, could come from the outside world,

drew all his éfanas. The Alon king recovered all his country
east of Lakhaw. The Mughals held only Garheaon and
Malthurapur,

The vigour ol Ahom attack was now redoubled The
minor encounters that took place almost daily are beyond

how they were blistered by the sun, or soaked in water and
bespatlered with mud, -but ever vigilant and ever eady to
repel the enemy.

After almost daily attacks and alarms, an assault in force
was delivered on Garhgaon in the night of 8th July. The
Ahoms broke down the bamboo railing on the north side of
the palace enclosure, routed the Buxari_ matchlock-men posited
there, and sefzed half the enclosure, which was the elfadel of
Garhgaon. Vinally, by the exertion of every man in the
garrison the fort was completely recovered, and the night of
etisis passed away, The grandest of all the assadlis was
delivered on {2th July by the entire Ahom army in tour

and never again was the enclosure penelralecl by the enemy,

In August a terrible epidemic broke oul in the Mughal

The exuliant Ahoms renewed their attacks on Garhyaon
and there was fighting every night outside the fort. The
pestilence now reached its exlreme, as the refugees trom
Mathurapur had infected the garrison of Garhgaon, Mir Jumla
lived and ate fike the common soldiers.

By the third weele of Seplember, the worst was over.
The rain began to decrease, the ‘flood went down, the
roads re-appeared.

§ 5. Doings of Mughal navy; Mir Junla
resumes the offensive,

Through all these darks months the Mttyhal navy posted at
Lakhauy uncer admiral [bn Husain, saved itself and thus saved
the army. His boats plied up and down the river and kept
constant touch with Gauhati and through it with Daeca and
Delhi. Then he landed and made reprisals against the Ahom
nobles shellering in the Majult islarcl And finally, when the
rains began to decrease he co-operated from the north to
open the road to Garhgaon. From Lakhau large quantities of
provisions were now sent by land and water ander escort,
and arrived at Garhgaon on 24th and 3ist October
respectively. Plenty now look the place of famine.

The land having dried, the Mughal cavalry was again
irresistible, and Jayadhwaj and his nobles fled to the fills of
Namrup a second lime. Mir Jumla now resumed the offensive,
and marched by way of Solaguti to Tipam, (18th December),
This was destined fo be the farthest point of his advance, On

0th November he had a fainting fi. “This was the beginning
of the disease of which he was to die.” But he clung
tenaciously fo his purpose. On 30th November the Baduli
Phukan came over to the Mughal side, and was highly
rewarded and made the Emperor's viceroy for Eastern Assam.
More Ahom notables followed his profitable example of
desertion, anc Jayadhwaj was left helpless and alone in the
pestilential hills of Namrup.

On 10th December, Mir Jumla had a severe attack of
ness; a burning fever seized him, to which pleurisy was
soon added, The entire Mughal army refused to enter Namrup
and plotled to desert their general and return home.

8 6. Treaty of peace with Asscun.

Through Dilir Khan's mediation a treaty was signed with
the Ahom king, on the following terms :

(i) Jayadhwaj would send his daughter and the sons of
the Tipam Rajah to the Mughal Court

(ii) The Ahom king would deliver immediately a war-
indemnity of 20,000 fofas of gold, 1,20,000 ftolas of silver, and
20 elephants fo the Emperor (besides 15 and 5 elephants for
Mir Jumla and Dilir Khan respectively).

(i) During the next 12 months he would deliver 3 lakhs
of folas of silver and 90 elephants in three equal instalments,
as the balance of the indemnity.

(iv) Thereafter he would pay an annual tribute of 20
elephants.

(v} Pending the full payment of the indemnity, the sons
of the Burha Gohain, the Bar Gohain, the Garhgaonia Phukan,
and the Bar Patra Phukan, were to be held by the Nawab
as hostages.

of the Brahmaputra and west of the Kallang river on the

south bank, was to be annexed to ihe empire. Thus the
Mughals were to get more than half of the provinee of
Darrang, rich in elephants.

(vil) The captives carried off by the Ahoms from the
Mughal dominions (esp. Kamrup) were to be released, as also
the wife and children of the Baduli Phukan whom the king
had thrown into prison.

On 3th January, 1663, the Ahom king’s daughter, hostages,
and some gold silver and elephants, as part of the incemnily,
reached the Mughal camp, and five days later Mir Jumla began
his return march. At last, yielding to medical advice he
embarked in a boat and glided down the river towards Dacea,
dying on the way on 31st March, 1663.

8 7. Greatness of Mite Jumta’s character.

Judged as a military exploit, Mir Jumia’s invasion of Assam
was a success. He forced the Rajah to make a humiliating
treaty, realized a large indemnity, and secured the promise of
a large cession of territory and further payments. If ils
political consequences were not permaneni, if the eeded
districts were lost and even Gauhali wrested from the Mughal
grasp only four years after his death, lhe fault was not his.

Though Mir Jumla’s expedition ended in heavy loss of inen,
his own death from disease and exhaustion and the speedy
loss of his acquisitions in Kuch Bihar and Assam, yet his
character shone with supreme radiance in this enterprise. No
other general of that age conducted war wilh so much
hemanity and justice, nor kept his soldiers, privates ancl
captains alike, under such discipline ; no other general could
have retained to the fast the confidence and even affection
of his subordinates amidst such appalling sufferings and
dangers. The owner of 20 maunds of diamonds, viceroy of
the rich province of Bengal, he shared with the meanest soldier

the privations of the march and brought premature death on
himself by scorning delights and living laborious days, He
issued sirict orders forbidding plunder, rape and oppression
on the people, and saw to it that his orders were obeyed.
The stern punishment which he meted out to the first few
offenders had a salutary effect We realize Mir Jumla’s peculiar
excellence more clearly by contrast with others. With a hero
like Mir Jumia, the rhetoric of the historian Talish ceases to be
extravagance; his eulogy of the general is not fulsome flattery
but homage deservedly paid to a born king of men.

8 8 Muafials lose Kameup : fighl for it, 1667—1681.

The Mughals continued io hold Mir Jumla’s gains in Assam
tH 1667. The Ahoms pail the war-indemnity in full, but
in five years. Their new ing  Chakradhwaj (accession in
November 1663) determined on war and made preparations
for i In August 1667 he sent two armies under his nobles
down the two banks of the Brahmaputra. The Mughal forts
on the way fell in rapid succession, and finally Gauhati
itself was captured early in November. Immense quantities
of arms, horses, and other spoils fell into the hands of the
viclors, and large numbers of Muslims, including several
officers, were faken prisoners and massacred. At one blow
the Mughal frontier was pushed back to the Monas river.
Gauhati became the seat of an Ahom viceroy.

The Mughals tried {fo reconquer the lost territory, but a
long desultorg and finally fruitless warfare followed. In
February 1669, Ram Singh (he son and successor of Mirza
Rajah Jai Singh) arrived at Rangamati from the Court to
fake charge of the war. But from the first his task was
hopeless) He had only $8,000 troopers round his standards
and his losses were seldom replenished. The Ahoms, being
a nation in arms, mustered] one hundred thousand when

1392 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB lon, VI

mobilized. Unlike the time of Mir Jumlta’s invasion, the
mastery of the water now belonged to the Ahoms, and the
Mughals could do litle with their 40 war-vessels on the
Brahmaputra. '

Nor had Ram Singh his heart in the work, as he knew
that he had been sent to Assam to die of fever as a punish-
meni for his having assisted in the escape of Shivaji from
Agra in 1666. Soon after his arrival on the scene, Ram
Singh laid siege io Gauhati, but all his attempts to take it
failed. In| March 1671 he fell back on Rangamati and
stayed there for some years, doing nothing. Finally in (676
he was pertnitted to return to Court.

After the death of Chakradhwaj (1670), the Ahom
monarchy was greatly weakened by internal troubles. From
1670 to 1681 “in the short space of eleven years there
were no less than seven kings, not one of whom died a
natural death ;” ambifious and unscrupulous nobles usurped
the supreme power, fought cach other for selfish gain, mace
and unmade kings. In February, 1679, the Bar Dhulan, in
fear of his tival the Burha Gohain, betrayed Gautiatt into
the hands of the Mughals.

But in 1681 Gacadhar Singh ascended the Ahom throne
and soon retrieved the glory of his house. He easily captured
Gathati with a vast amount of booty. Thus, Kamrup was
finally Jost to Bengal.

While Mir Jumla was besieged in Garhgaon (1669), Kuch
Bihar had been recovered by its Rajah and the Mughal garrison
expelled, In March 1664, Shaista Khan, the new governor
of Bengal, reached Rajmahal, and the Kuch Rajah imme
diately made his submission in fear of the Mughal arms,
and paid an indemnity of five and a half fakhs of Rupees.
This Rajah, Pran Narayan, died in 1666, and therealter, for
nearly half a century, the State was paralysed by civil wars,
royal oppression and internal disorder. The Mughals took

advaniage of it to extend their sway over the southern and
eastern portions of the kingdom, conquering much of the
present districts of Rangpur and Western Kamrup, and forcing
the Rajah in 1711 t confirm these gains by treaty.

8 9. Pirates of Chatgaon and their ravages in Bengal,

The district of Chatgaon was for many centuries a
debatable land between the Muslim rulers of Bengal and the
Mongoloid chiefs of Arrakan. Early in the 17th century
the Feni river was fixed as the boundary between the two
Powers, but during the next half century the Magh ascendency
in the rivers and creeks of East Bengal became complete in
consequence of Jahangir’s supine adininisiration, the rebellion
of his heir Shah Jahan, and the increase of the Atrakanese
naval power by the infusion of a foreign element, ris, the
Feringi or Portuguese adventurers and theft half-caste offspring,
who lived jin Chatgaon as the obedient instruments of the
local Rajah.

“The Arrakan pirates, both Magh and Feringi, used constantly
to come by the water-route and plunder Bengal, They carried
off the Hindus and Muslims that they could seize. On reaching
home the pirales employed some of the hardy men that
had survived the voyage in fillage and other degrading pursuits.
The olhers were sold to the Dutch, English and French
merchants at the ports of the Deccan. As they continually
practised raids for a long time, Bengal daily became more
and more desolaie and loss and Jes$ able fo resist them, The
district of Bakla (ie, Baqarganj and part of Dacca), which
formerly abounded in houses and cultivated fields and yielded
a large revenue as duty on betel-nuts, was swept so clean
with their broom of plunder and abduction that ‘none was
left to tenant any house or kindle a light in that region.”

“The sailors of the Bengal flotilla were inspired with such
fear of the pirates that whenever a hundred war-boats of the


--- Page 141 ---
134 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB lew VEE

former sighted only four of the latter, the Bengal crew
thought themselves lucky if they could save their lives by
flight,”

“The Feringi pirates used to give half their booly to the
Rajah of Atrakan and keep the other half They were
popularly known as the Harmad (a corruption of the Portuguese
word Avimada or tlect) and owned a hundred swift galleys
full of war-material.” Manucci knew them as “men bard ot
heart, accustomed io bill even little children without a
regret.”

A heavy loss was caused to the imperial revenue by the
depopulation of the riverside areas of Easl Bengal. Imperial
prestige was even more grievously affected. The safely of
the province demanded that the nest of pirates at Chalgaon
should be conquered.

Shaista Khan was ordered to underlake this unfinished work
of Mir Jumla. At first sight his task seemed to be utterly
hopeless. The Mughal flotilla (nawwara) stationed in Bengal,
for the maintenance of which 14 Jakhs of Rupees a year
was provided by means of land grant, had greatly
deteriorated owing to Prince Shuja’s slackk administration
and the peculation of ihe officers, What remained of it
was ruined during Mir Jumla’s invasion of Assam. In short,
the Bengal navy had now practically ceased to exist
and Shaista Khan’s first taske was to create one anew.

This he now did. His spirit and energy overcame every
obsiacle, At the dockyards of Dacca, Hughli, Jessore, Bale-
shwar, Karibari etc. new ships were built, and ina little
over a year's time a new navy of 300 boals was built and
manned and equipped for war. At Dhapa, six miles south-east
of Dacca town, a hundred war-vessels were stationed and 200
more at Sangramgarh 30 miles further south, the two posls
being connected by a military road raised above the flood
level. The island of Sondip is a very convenient half-way

house belween Sangramgarh and Chatgaon, being only six
hours’ sail of the latter town. Its present master was Dilawwat,
a runaway captain of the Mughal navy, but a warrior and
ruler of remarkable ability.

In November 1665, the cruising admiral Abul Hasan attacked
and caplured Sondip; Dilawwar who had fought most
heroically, though he was now an old man of eighty, was
wouuded and taken in chains to Dacca, and a Mughal garrison
was put in the island,

Shaista Khan now won the Feringis over with tempting
offers of service under the Mughals. His work was made
easier by a murderous quarrel between these men and their
Arrakanese masters. The whole Feringi colony of Chatgaon
hurriedly fled with their families and property to Mughal
terrilory (Dec. 1665). Their leaders were enrolled in the
imperial navy on tiberal salaries. “The coming over of the
Feringis gave composure to the bearis of the people of Bengal.”

8 10, Mughal conquest of Chatgaon,

On 4th December, 1665, the expeditionary force, 6,500
strong, left Dacea under command of Buzurg Ummed Khan, a
son of Shaista Khan. The imperial fleet numbered 288 vessels
of all kinds ; the Feringis, with about 40 vessels of their own,
acted as auxiliaries. The plan of campaign was that the fleet
under Ibn Husain should creep along the coasi, while the army
should march parallel to it, cutling the jangle along the sea-
shore stage by stage and making a way, cach branch support
ing the other. Farhad Khan leading the vanguard crossed
the Peni river on 14th January, 1666, and entered the
Arrakanese lerritory,

On the 23rd, the Mughal admiral sailed out of the
Kumatia creek anc encountered the enemy's fleet, consisting
of 10 gSurabs and 45 jalias, which had come out of the


--- Page 143 ---
136 SHORT RISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cw Vil

Kathalia creek to give battle, The Feringis led the Mughal
van, and their onset decided the day. The Maghs in the
ghurabs jumped everboard giving their ships up to capture,
while the jalias fled away.

But this was only the light squadron of the enemy's
fleet. Their larger ships, which carried more guns, now came
out of the Hurla creek into the open sca.

The second and greater victory was won next morning
(24th January), when the Muslims flying their victorious
banners, advanced upon the enemy firing their guns. The
Atrakanese fleet retreated into the [Karnafuli river, firing on
the advancing Mughals. Entering the mouth of the river al
3 p.M, they drew up their ships in line of battle between
Chatgaon and an island in midstream. On the opposile bank,
close to the village of Feringi-bandar, they had erected three
bamboo stockades. But Ibn Husain sent most of his ships up the
river and also made an attack by land, and took the stockacles.

Then the Mughals, flushed with victory, dashed themsclves
upon the enemy’s ships, A great batile was fought. The fort
of Chatgaon also opened fire on the Mughals. At last the
enemy were vanquished ; many of their sailors jumped
overboard and escaped by swimming, a few being drowned ;
ihe rest were slain or taken prisoner. One hundred and
thirty-five vessels became the prize of the victors. Next
day, (95th January) the fort of Chatgaon was besieged.
Early in the morning of the 96th the fort capitulated
to Ibn Husain ; but the disorderly followers of the zamindar
Munawwar Khan who entered first with a view to
plunder, set fire fo the houses, and much of the town,
including two State elephants, was burnt. The Arrakanese also
fled from the fort on the other bank of the Karnafuli river, but
the fugitives were attacked and plundered by their former
slaves, the kidnapped Muslims of Bengal who had been settled
here as peasants.

Meantime, ever since hearing the news of the advance of
the flect on the 93rd, the army under Farhad Khan had been
making strenuous efforts to force a way through the dense
jungle towards Chatgaon. At his approach the Maghs
abandoned their outposts in the way. The Commander-in-Chief
himself arrived at Chatgaon on the 26th and made his
tyiumphal entry info the fort the next day. The prize taken
was of litte money value. It consisted of three elephants,
1,026 pieces of cannon made of brass and iron (mostly small
pieces, carrying 1 lb. or smaller shot), many matchlocks and
camel-swivels (zamburaks), and much ammunition. But the
most glorious result of the victory was the release and
restoration to home of thousands of Bengal peasants who
had been kidnapped by the pirates and held in serfdom ;
and ils greatest benefit was the increase of cultivation in deltaic
Bengal. Chatgaon was made the seat of a Mughal faujdar
and the name of the town was changed to Islamabad.

$41. Ae Afghans ; their chacucter and relations
wilh the Mughal empire.

In the valleys leading from India to Kashmir and Afghanistan,
and in the encompassing hills, live numberless Turko-lranian
clans, called Pathans in the north and Baluches in the south.
Even after conversion to Islam, they have retained their old
speech, their old tribal organization, and their immemorial
profession of brigandage.

Brave and hardy as these people are above all the races of
the plains, they are torn by the feud of clan against clan and
often of family against family. In all their history they have
failed to establish any large and compact Stale, or even any
enduring confederacy of tribes,

They have never formed a nation, but always clans. Within
the clans even, the strict discipline of the Rajput tribal system
is wanting; the Yusufzal or Afridi follows his chieftain only

while it is his interest or pleasure to doso. These ever-forming
ever-dissolving groups of families are the only effective fyrees
of an Afghan clan for offence or defence ; the nominal chieftain
merely governs on the sufferance of his followers. The family
and nat the clan is the true unit of Afghan sociely.

C Highway robbery was the hereditary profession of these
hardy savages, as cunning as they are bold. Their lands
yielded too scanty a sustenance for their fast-erowing numbers ;
and the peaceful gains of agriculture were loo poor and slow
a reward in comparison with the plunder of their more industri-
ous neighbours and of the rich traders passing wilhin easy
reach of them.) The right of the hillmen,— Africis, Shinwaris,
Yusufzais and Khataks,—-to levy toll on the traffic between India
and Kabul, had been practically admitted by the Mughal
Government, which had found by lone experience that it was
cheaper to bribe the clansmen than to coerce them, as a means
of preserving order in that region and keeping the roads
open. But even political pensions were not always effective in
securing their obedience. A leader would spring up among
them, pretending sanctity or princely descent, organize a band
of young men by feeding them for some time at his own cost,
and then swoop down upon the fields of rival clans or the
imperial terrilory below for plunder, The gang held together so
fong as the stream of booty did not fail ; bul when it ran
dry, or the least inequality in its division was suspected, these
natural democrats turned their arms against one another, and
the league broke up."

A strong Mughal emperor would resolve to enforce his
authority and protect his subjects ; armies would be poured
into the valleys of the clansmen, and after heavy losses their
organized resistance wotld be beaten down, their houses

In a few years the growth of populalion would more than
fill the void caused by the Mughal sword; and the hungry
hordes would again begin to swarm into the neighbouring
district or plunder trade-caravans.

The fitst disaster to the Mughal atms here took place in
February 1586, when an army of 8,000 men under Rajah
Birbal was cut offin a Swat defile. Cthe Emperor had finally
to pateh up a peace by pensioning the iribal leaders and
overlooking their depredations. Under Jahangir and Shah
Jahan, the same state of things continued, \

8 12. Yusufect rising of 1667.

Early in 1667 began another movement for expansion
among the Yusufgais, whose home lies ia the Swat and Bajaur
valleys and the plain of north Peshawar. One of their great
men, named Bhagu, drew the heads of other families into
his scheme, crowned a pretended scion of their ancient kings
as Muhammad Shah, and secured religious prestige to his
banners by association with Mulla Chalak, who enjoyed a
great local reputalion for sanctity. Bhagu as wor and virtual
king, organized an expeditionary force of 5,000 clansmen,
erossecl the Indus above Attock and invaded Pakhli, a plain
lying east of (hat river in the Hazara district, through which
ran the principal road to Kashmir. Here they captured the
fort of Shadman the local chieftain, and levied rent from the
peasants. The number of invaders daily increased and more
Mughal outposts were attacked. Other Yusufzai bands began

140 SHORT MISTORY OF AURANGZIR {cu. Vil

io plunder the imperial territory in the western Peshawar and
Attock districts.

The Emperor took strong measures of defence, and ordered
the rebel country to be invaded by three columns. The
enemy anticipated the invasion by coming over to the south
side of the ferry of Ilarun across the Indus and holding it in
force, so as to prevent the Mughals from crossing into their
country, On ist April 1667, they were attacked here by
Kamil Khan (the faujdar of Attock). After a stubborn — fight,
the enemy broke and were driven into the river; two
thousand of them were slain, many wounded, and many
more drowned. The imperial territory on this side of the
Indus was cleared of the enemy.

In May, Shamshir Khan, at the head of a large detachment
from Afghanistan, took over the supreme command and
crossed the Indus into the Yusufzai country.

Shamshir’ fought many a battle with them and gained
many a sticcess. Entrenching his camp at Ohind, he occupied
the level country of Mandaur where the Yusufeais used fo
grow their food crops, and destroyed all their farms and
hoinestead in the lowlands. On 4th June, he marched out
of Ohind {o attack Bhagu in his present position. Several
villages were taken afler hard fighting against heavy odds and
with considerable losses; the houses were burnt down, the
property looted and no vestige of cultivation left The
enemy's trenches at Mansur on the Panjshir river were  carriect
(28th June, 1667). At the end of August, Muhammad Amin
Khan, one of the highest grandees of the realm, arrived with
a large force and took over the supreme command from
Shamshir. The villages near Shahbazgarhi and in the valley of
Karahmar were plundered, while in the Swat valley the village
of Hijaz was destroyed (October). The Vusufzais seem to have
been quieted by these hard blows; and there was no general
rising of the frontier tribes till 1672,

1679] MUGHAL DISASTER IN IHAIBAR Pass 14

§ 13. Aftidi and Kfhatak vising of 1672 ; disasters to
Mughal generats.

In 1672, the tactless action of the faujdar of Jalalabad
bred discontent among the Khaibar clans. ‘The Afridis rose
under their chicftain Acmal Khan, a born general, who
crowned himself king, struck coins in his own name, and
proclaiming war against the Mughals, summoned all the Pathan
clans to join the national movement and closed the Khaibar
Dass,

In the spring of 1672, Muhammad Amin Khan, now viceroy
of Afghanistan started from Peshawar for Kabul, with his army
accompanied by their families and household property. At
Jamrud he learnt that the Afghans had blecked the way
ahead. But intoxicated with wealth and power, and despising
the Afghans’ prowess, he rushed blindly on to his doom,
Advancing to Ali Masjid (@tst April) he entrenched. At
night (he Afridis descended from the hillside and cut him
off from the stream whence he drew his water-supply, Next
day men and beasts in the imperial army began to perish of
thirst from the beal of the sun. The Afghans assailed the
Mughals with a storm of missiles. From the lofty peak of
Tartara, 3,400 feet overhead, stones were rolled down on
the doomed men crowded in the narrow gorge below. The
leaders were soon killed, and disorder seized the Mughal
army. “Horses, elephants and men were mixed up in
contusion.’ The Afghans now charged down the hillside,
slaying and plundering the entire Mughal camp.’

Muhammad Amin Khan and some of his high officers,
succeeded fn escaping to Peshawar with their bare fives ;
but everything else was lost, “Ten thousand men fell under
the enemy’s swotd in the field, and above two krores of
Rupees in cash and kind was looted by the enemy. They

j4o SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cn Vi

captured twenty thousand men and women and sent them to
Central Asia for sale’’ The viceroy’s family—his mother,
wife and daughter,—had been made captive, and he
had fo secure fheir release by paying a huge tansom.
This signal victory increased the fame and resources of
the Afridi leader. The tale of his rich booty went the round
of the hills and lured recruits to his banners.

The Khalaks are a large and warlike clan occupying the
southern part of the Peshawar districlL and much of Kohat
and Banu. They were the hereditary enemies of the Yusufzais,
because the boundaries of these two clans met in the middle
of the Peshawar district. Their chieftain Kbush-hal Khan was
a great poel. Years ago he had inspired defiance of the
imperial Government among his clansmen. Bal he had been
treacherously arrested and kept in Hinclustan for three years
as a prisoner. In 1667 he had joined lhe Mughal force
that invaded the Yusufzai country. But now joining Acmal,
he became the leading spirit of the national opposition,
inspiring the tribesmen with his pen no less than his sword,
and winning many a victory over the Mughals.

The danger to the empire was very great : the rising was a
national one, affecting the whole Pathan land “from Qandahar
to Attock,” and its leaders were also met who had served in
the Mughal army in Hindustan and the Deccan, and knew the
organization efficiency ancl tactics of the imperialists. The two
sides had the same arms, and except that the Afghans lacked
heavy artillery, the superiority lay with them, as they were hardy
hillmen fighting in their own rugged country, while the Incian
troops have always had a horror of mountain war and aversion
to facing privalion and cold,

The Emperor, immedialely on hearing of the disaster, took
strong measures to guard Peshawar against any Afghan incursion ;
Muhammad Amin Khan was degraded; Mahabat Khan, who
had governed Afghanistan thrice before, and achieved success

in dealing with these people, was recalled from the Deccan and
sent to Kabul as viceroy for the fourth time. But the new
governor shrank irom risking the fate of his predecessor. He
avoided any energetic action against the exulfant Afghans, and
made a secret arrangement with them, each side promising not
to imolesl the other. Next spring he went ta Kabul by the
Karapa Pass afler bribing the Afghans on the way not to
oppose him, But the Khaibar rotite remained closed as before.
The Emperor was highly displeased and sent Shujaet Khan in

material and artillery, fo punish the Afghans (14th November,
1673). Jaswant Singh was to co-operate with him.

Shujaet Khan was a man of humble origin who had tisen
to high rank and the Emperor’s favour by his success in quelling
the Satnami rising. He was therefore regarded with jealousy
and contempt by high-born officers Ike Mahabat Khan and
Maharajah Jaswant Singh. Shujaet, on his part, proud of his
master’s fayour and of his own past triumphs, despised the
advice of Jaswant, and took his own line of action. This fack
of co-operation among the Mughal leaders caused the
lisaster of 1674.

Shujaet Khan tric to push on to Kabul. After crossing the
Gandab, he ascended the saddle (ola/) of the Karapa Pass
(Qist February), That night there was a heavy fall of vain and
snow; and every one in the Indian camp was brought to
death's door by the extreme cold and wet. The Afghans from
the heights on the two sides began to harass the suffering army.
The imperialists were benumbed with cold. At dawn the
Afghans charged the miserable army froin all sides.  Shujaet
Khan, forgetful of his duty as a general, sought and found a
soldier’s death in the front rank, His leaderless troops were
hemmed round; but a band of 500 Rathors, wisely sent by
Jaswant, arrived with guns, broke the enemy’s cordon, and
brought the remnant of the army back to camp. Three hundred

Shujaet’s followers thousands had fallen before.

To restore imperial prestige, Aurangzib himself went to
Hasan Abdal, between Rawal Pindi and Peshawar, (26th June,
1674), and stayed there for a year and a half directing the
operations. A vast army accompanied him with a farge park
of artillery. Strong and well-equipped columns with plenty of
material were sent into the enemy’s country. Aghar Khan, a
Turkish noble, who had often distinguished himself in fighting
the Afghans, was hurriedly recalled from the Deccan and
deputed to clear the way in the Khaibar region, (July).
Mahabat Khan was removed from his post as viceroy, on
suspicion of having connived at the destruction of Shujact
Khan.

With Aurangzib’s arrival on the scene, imperial diplomacy,
no less than imperial arms, began to have effect. Many clans
were won overt by the grant of presents, pensions, /ag/rs, and
posts in the Mughal army to their headmen. As for the
irreconcilables, their valleys were penetrated by detachments
from Peshawar. Thus, in a short time, the Ghorai, Ghilzai,
Shirrani and YVusufzai clans were defeated and ousted from
their villages. Dariya Khan Afridi’s followers promised to
bring the head of Acmal, the Afridi pretender, if their past
tuisdeeds were forgiven, (end of August),

'  Meanlime, great deeds were being done by Aghar Khan
west of Peshawar, First, he foiled a night attack of the
Mohmands and their allies and retaliated by slaying 500 of them,
ravaging their homes and bringing away 2,000 captives and
much booty. Then he iried to open the Khaibar Pass, but
after a long contest near Ali Masjid in which both sides lost
heavily and Aghar Khan was severcly wounded, the attempt
was abandoned. The jealousy of his colleagues, especially of
the Hindustani nobles, added to the difficulties of Aghar Khan
and his brother Turks. Next, with a force of 5,000 Rajputs

and Afghan friendlies, he occupied Nangrahar and tried to
keep the roads open. The Ghilzais who had seized the
Jagdalal: Pass were repeatedly defeated and expelled from
it Of all the Mughal generals he alone was uniformly
victorious over the frontier tribes, and Afghan mothers, it
is said, used to hush their babies to sleep with his dreaded
name.

In the spring of 1675, when Fidai Khan set out on his
return from Kabul to Peshawar, the Afghans attacked him in
the Jagdalak Dass. His van was defeated, its Arab commander
was slain, and many of the elephants, artillery, baggage and
women of this division were carried off by the enemy. But
lhe  viceroy’s courage and steadiness saved the centre.
Aghar han, then at ihe ‘4ana of Gandamak, on hearing of
his critical situation, came to the rescue by rapid marches,
and forced the Jagdalak Pass, routing the enemy from the
hillfogs.

Early in June, however, “a great defeat befell the imperial
army.” Mukarram Khan with a large force was operating
against the Afghans near the saddle (ofa?) of Khapush in
the Bajaur country, where one day he was tured into an
ambush, hopelessly outnumbered, and lost heavily.

Retribulory measures were taken immediately, and all
the Mughal positions in Afghanistan were strengthened.

At the end of August came the news of two reverses,
though on a small scale; Hizbar [han, the t6anadar of
Jagdalak, was slain with his son and other Mughal soldiers ;
Abdallah, the ‘fanadar of Barangab and Surkhab, was driven
out of his post, affer losing many of his troops. But, on the
whole, the imperialisis held their own by means of outposts
and forts at stralegic points in the Pathan country. By the
end of the year 1675 the situation had sufficiently improved
to enable the Emperor to leave Hasan Abdal and return to
Delhi.

§ i4, Amir Khan ably governs Afghanistan, 1678-98,

Mir Khan, the son of Khalilutlah, had previously
distinguished himself by punishing the Yusufzais of Shahbazgyarhi
and suppressing two rebellious Afghan chiefs in Bihar. In
1675 he was given the ile of Amir Khan, and on {9th March
1677 appointed viceroy of Kabul. [He arrived al his post on
8th June 1678 and continued to govern Afghanistan with
signal ability till his death twenty years later. Ife set himself
fo win the hearts of the Afghans and enter into social
relations with them, with such  suceess that ihe chiefs of the
clans “left their shy and unsocial manners atid began to visit
him without any suspicion’ They became very friendly to
him, and every one of them looked up to him for advice
in conducting his domestic affairs, Under his astute
management, they ceased to trouble the imperial Government
and spent their energies in internecine quarrels. Once he
broke up the confederacy under Acmal by secreily instigating
that chieftain’s followers to ask him to divide the conquered
territory among them. Acmal declined the proposal, saying,
“How can a small territory be divided among so many men ?”
The disappointed hillmen threw up his service and began to
return home in anger. Aecmal had at last lo make a division
of the land; but as he naturally showed greater consideration
to his own clansmen and kinsfolk, his other followers were
disgusted and left his camp. Much of Amir Khan's
administrative success was duc to the wise counsel, tact and
energy of his wife, Sahibji, a daughter of Ali Mardan Khan.

CHAPTER VII

AURANGZIB’S RELIGIOUS POLICY AND HINDU
REACTION TO IT

81. The Muslim State, its theory and character,

By the theory of its origin the Muslim State is a theocracy.
Us true king is God, and earthly rulers are merely His agents -
bound to enforce His law on all. The civil authorilics exist
solely to spread and enforce the true faith, In such a State
infidelity is logically equivalent to treason, because the infidel
repudiates the authority of the true king and pays homage
to his rivals, the false gods and goddesses. Therefore, the
toleration of any sect outside the fold of orthodox Islam is
no better than compounding with sin. And the worst
form of sin is polytheism, the belief that the one true
God has pariners in the form of other dcleities. Cistamic
theology, therefore, tells the true believer that his highest
duty is to make “exertion (/ifad) in the path of God," by
waging war against infidel lands (dar-uifard) till they
become a part of the realm of Islam (dar~ilJslam) and
their populations are converted into true believers.» After
congtiest the entire infidel population beeomes theoretically
reduced to the slatus of slaves of the conquering army, \

The conversion of the entire population to Islam and’ the
extinction of every form of dissent, is the ideal of the

on him, and bribes offered fo him from the public funds, to

§ 2. Political disabilities of non-Muslims.

« non-Muslim, therefore, cannot be a citizen of the State ;
he is a member of a depressed class; his sfatus is a modified
form of slavery, He lives under a contract (gimuna) with
the State: for the fife and property that are grudgingly
spared to him by the Commander of the Faithful he must
undergo polilical and social  clisabilities, and pay a
commutation~money ( jaxtya)..y ‘

He must pay a tax for his land (fara/), from which the
early Muslims were exempt; he must pay other exactions
for the maintenance of the army, in which he cannot enlist
even if he offers to render personal service instead of paying
the poll-tax; and he must show by humility of dress and
behaviour that he belongs to a subject class. No non-Muslim
(ximmi) can wear fine dresses, ride on horseback or carry
arms ; he must behave respectfully and submissively to every
membet of the dominant sect. T

As the learned Qazi Mughis-ucl-cin declared to Ala-ud-
din Khalji, in accordance with the teaching of the books
on Canon Law: “By these acts of degradation are shown
the extreme obedience of Ihe &émrnf, the glorification of the
trae faith of [slam, and the abasement of false laiths. The
Prophet has commanded us to slay them, plunder them, and
make them captive.. No other religious authority except the
great Imam [Hanifal whose faith we follow, has sanctioned the
imposition of the /agfya on Hindus. According to all other
theologians, the rule for Hindus is ‘Either death or Islam’ ”

The early Arab conquerors, notably in Sindh, followed the
wise and profitable policy of leaving the shrines and religious
praclices of the non-Muslim population praclically unclisturbed.
There was at first no wanton or systematic iconoclasin. With

subjects. In addition to the _poll-tax _and public _degradation

in dress and demeanour imposed on them, the non ~Muslims

were - subjected to ‘various hopes and | fears. Rewards in the
forni"6f money ‘and public. employment _ were. offered. to
aposfales from Hinduism. The leaders of Hindu religion and
society” were “systemat fically repressed, to deprive the sect of
spiritual instruction, and their religious gatherings and proces-
sions were forbidden in order to prevent the growth of
solidarity and a sense of communal strength among them.
No new temple was allowed to be built nor any old one to be
repaired, so that the total disappearance of all places of
{lindu worship was lo be mercly a question of lime. But
many of the more fiery spirits of Islam tried to anticipate the
destructive hand of Time and forcibly pulled down temples.

In this later age, particularly among the Turks, the old
Arab foleration of false faiths appeared sinful, Outside their
own realms, the destruction of lemples and the slaughter of
Hindus sanelified every war of aggression. Thus a frame of
mind was produced in the Muslim community which habitually
regarded plunder and homicide as the purest of human acts,
as “exertion (//fad) in the path of God.” The murder of infidels
(katit-kus6t) is counted a merit in a Muslim. It is not neces~
sary that he should tame his own passions or mortify his
flesh ; it is not necessary for him to grow a rich growth of
spitituality. He has only to slay a certain class of his fellow-
beings or plunder their lands and wealth, and this act in itself

would raise his soul fo heaven.”

“When, in (9{0, Boutros Pasha was murdered by an Egyptian Muhammadan for
no personal provocation but for the political reason that he had piesided over the
court that sentenced the Denshawai villagers, and the guilt of the murderer was
conclusively proved by evidence, the Chief Qazi of Egypt pronounced the judgment
that according to Islam it is no ecrine for a Muslim to slay an unbeliever. ‘this is
the opinion held by the highest exponent of Islamic law in a modern civilized
country,

152 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB {cn. WII

A creed whose followers are taught to regard
robbery and murder as a religious duty, is incompatible with
the progress of mankind or with the peace of the world.

§ 3. Influence of the Quranic political ideals on the
Muslim population and the subject creeds.

Nor has il been conducive to the true interests of its
followers. Muslim polity formed “the faithful” into a body
with no other profession than war. As long as there were
any fresh lands to conquer and any fich gaffrs to plunder,
all went well with the Stale." The dominant body prospered
and multiplied rapidly ; even arts and industries, literature and
painting of a cerfain type were fostered. But when the tide
of Muslim expansion reached its farthest limit and broke in
vain on the hills of Assam and Chatgaon, or the arid rocks
of Maharashtra, there was nothing to avert a rapid downfall.
The State had no economic basis, and was not able to. stand
a time of peace,

For, the cruel kindness of the Government had untfitted
the dominant people for avocations of peace and the silent
but deadly struggle for existence. War is the only trade they
have a natural aptitude for, and peace means to them
“unemployment,” vice and downfall.

The settled principle of Islam ended by making the
Muslims a privileged class, nourished on Slale bounties,
naturally prone to indolence in peace times and unable to
stand on their own legs in the arena of life. Public office
came to be regarded as the birthright of the faithful, and so

* “The Arabs lived on the fat of the conquered provinces, and subject peoples
served them. Of booty taken in war four-fifths were distributed lo the army ou

and poll-tax of conquered countries, the suplus of which, aller defraying civil
and military charges, became equally with spoils of war patrimony 6f the Arab
nation.” (Muir's Calfpfiate, 188), Elliot, i. 461,

every inducement to display superior ability or exertion was
taken away from them. The vast sums spent by the State
in maintaining pauper houses and in scattering alms during
Ramzan and other holy days and joyous ceremonies, were
a ditect premium on laziness. Thus a lazy and pampered
class was created in the empire, who sapped its strength
and was the first to suffer when its prosperity was arrested.
Wealih bred indolence and love of ease; these soon led
to vice; and vice finally brought about poverty and ruin.

At the same time, the treatment of the subject people prevent-
ed the full development of the resources of the State by them.
When a class of men is publicly depressed and harassed by law
and executive caprice alike, it merely contents tiself with dragging
on an animal existence. The Hindus cottld not be expected to
produce the ulmost of which they were capable; their lot was
to be hewers of wood and drawers of water to their masters,
to bring grist fo the fiscal mill, fo develop a low cunning and
flattery as the only means of saving what they could out of
the fruits of their own labour, Amidst such social conditions,
the human hand and the human mind cannot achieve their
best ; the hunian soul cannot soar {o its highest pitch. The
barrenness of the Hindu intellect and the meanness of spirit of
the Hindu upper classes are the grealest condemnation of
Muhammadan rule in India, The Islamic political tree, judged
by its fruit, was an utter failure.

As a widely travelled and profound modern philosopher
writes, “Islam is a religion of absolute surrender and submissive~
ness to God—but toa God of a certain character—a War-Lord...
The ritual of this belief embodies the idea of discipline. ..This
military basis of Islam explains all the essential virtues of the
Musalman. It also explains his fundamental defects-—his
unprogtessiveness, his incapacity to adapt himself, his lack of
initiative arid invention. The soldier has simply to obey orders.
All the rest is the affair of Allah.” (H. Keyser'ling).


--- Page 161 ---
154 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cH VUI

When public offices are distributed in consideration of race
or creed and not of merit, the non-Muslim populations are
thereby driven to conclude that they have no lot or part in
such a State. The Islamic theocracy when set up over a
composite population has the worst vices of oligarchy and of
alien rule combined.

In Mughal India it was, in addition, the dominion of a small
minority. And this minority differed from the politically
depressed majority nol in racial qualities, physical or mental,
but in creed only. It was rightly felt by all persons oulside
the fold of the dominant creed that the power and resources
of the community, entrusted to the Government for the public
good, were being misused by being applied to the propaganda
of a Church which aimed at their extinction. Such a State had
no right to be called national ; it did not rest on the love and
devotion of the people.

8 4. Toleration under [slam exceptional and
contrary fo Quranic law.

Such was the ideal of ihe State as conceived by orthodox
islam. No doubt, common sense often triumphed over logic
and statesmanship over theology ; or the weakness of human
nature made it impossible for every king and every officer
to enforce the intolerant system everywhere or in its entirety.
Thus il happened that under Muslim rule there were periods
when the Hindus enjoyed toleration and security of property,
ot when an enlightened and liberal king encouraged them
to make progress in literature and art, wealth and public
service, and his State grew in strength and material resources.

But such indulgence of infidelity was by ifs very nature
precarious and exceptional. The Muslim workt regarded it
as a deplorable falling off from the orthodox ideal, and a
wicked neglect of royal duty, The Muslim soldiery on whose


--- Page 162 ---
AURANGZIB’S "IEMPIE DFMOLUION 155

sword depends the king’s power, would regard the tiberal
Sultan as an apostate, unworthy to rule over them,

Therefore, the growth and progress of non-Muslims, even
their conlinued existence, is incompatible with the basic principles
ot a Muslim Stale. The political community is in a condition
of unstable equilibrium, {ll either the dissenters are wiped out
or the sceptre passes ‘out of Muslim hands. Thus a chronic
antagonism between the rulers and the tuled is set up, which
has in the end broken up every Islamic State with a composite

population. And the reign of Aurangzib was to illustrate
this truth.

§ 5. Aurangzib’s bigotry and temple desteuction.

Awangzib began his attacke on finduism in an insidious
way. In the first year of his reign, in a charter granted
to a priest of Benares, he avowed thal his religion forbade
him to allow Me building of new temples, but did not
enjoin the destruction of old ones. During his viccroyalty
of Gujrat, 1644, he had desecrated the recently built Hindu
temple of Chintaman in Ahmadabad by killing a cow in it
and then turned the building info a mosque. He had at that
lime also deinolished many other Hindu temples in the
provinces, An order was issued early in his reign in which
the local officers in every town and village of Orissa from
Katak to Medinipur were called upon to pull down all temples,
inclucling even clay huts, built during the last 10 or 12 years,
and to allow no ofd temple fo be repaired.

Next, on 9th April, 1669, he issued a general order “to
demolish ali he schools and temples’ of the infidels and to
put down their religious teaching and practices.” His
destroying hand now fell on the great shrines that commanded

——ns

156 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB (cn. VII

fhe veneration of the Tlindus all over India~such as the
second temple of Somnath, lhe Vishwanath temple of Benares,
and the Keshay Rai temple of Mathura.

The holy city of Mathura has always been the special
victim of Muslim bigotry. It stood on the king’s highway
between Agra and Delhi. Aurangzib appointed a “religious
man,” Abdun Nabi, as faujdar of Mathura to repress the
Hindus.

On !4th October, 1666, learning that there was a stone
railing in the lemple of Keshav Rai, which Dara Shukoh had
presented fo it, Aurangsib ordered itio be removed. And
finally in January 1670, he sent forth commands fo destroy
this temple altogether and to change the name of the city to
islamabad, The destruction of Hindu places of worship was
one of the chief duties of the Muftasibs or Censors of
Morals who were appointed in all the sub-divisions and cities
of the empire. In June 1680, the {temples of Amber, the
capital of the loyal Stale of Jaipur, were broken down.

In 1674 he confiscated all the Jands held by Ilindus as
religious grants (wwazifa) in Gujrat.

$6. Jaziya or polletax on non-Muslims.

For permission to live in an Islamic Stale the unbeliever
has to pay a tax called JAZIVA, which means substitute nioney,
%e@, the price of indulgence, KH was first imposed by
Muhammad, who bade his followers “fight those who do not
profess the true faith, till they pay jaziza with the hand in
humility.” (Quran, ix. 29). The last two words of this.
command have been {taken by the Muslim commentators to
mean that the tax should be levied in a manner humiliating
to the taxpayers: the taxed Person must come on
foot and make the payment standing, while the receiver
should be seated. Women, children below fourteen, and


--- Page 164 ---
RULES OF JAZIYA 157

slaves were exempted from the tax; blind men, cripples and
lunatics paid only when they were wealthy: monks were
anlaxed if they were poor, but if they belonged to rich
monasteries the heads of these religious houses had to pay.
The impost was not proportioned to a man’s actual income,
but the assessees were roughly divided into three classes
according as their property was estimated at not more than
200 dirfams (“the poor’), between 900 and ten thousand
dirhams (“the middle class”), and above ten thousand (“the
ich"). Money-changers, cloth-dealers, landowners, merchants,
and physicians were placed in the highest class, while
artisans,—such as tailors, dyers, cobblers, and shoe-makers
were counted as “poor.” This last class paid only when
their professional income leff a margin above the cost of
maintaining themselves and their families. Begoars and
paupers naturally escaped the tax.

The rates of taxation were fixed at 12, 24 and 48 dirhams
a year for the three classes respectively—or Rs. 31/,,
Rs. 6%2 and Rs. 13%s. On the poor, therefore, the incidence
of the tax was at least 6 per cent of their gross income ; on
the middle class it ranged from 6 fo Yt p.c, and on the
tich it was always lighter even than 2'/2 per thousand, In
violation of modern canons of taxation, the jaziya hit the
poorest portion of the population hardest, and annually took
away from the poor man the full value of one yeat’s food
as the price of religious indulgence, Akbar had abolished the
fac and removed an invidious badge of degradation from
the majority of his subjects (1564) Aurangzib reversed this
policy.

By imperial orders the jazfga was reimposed on the
“inbelievers” in all parts of the empire from 2nd April,
1679, in order, as the official historian records, to “spread
Islam and put down the practice of infidelity.” The Hindus
of Delhi and its environs gathered together and pileously


--- Page 165 ---
158 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cu. VU

cried for the withdrawal of the impost But the Emperor
turned a deaf ear to them. Nex! Friday, the whole road from the
gate of the Fort to the Jama mosque was blocked by a crowd
of [lindu suppliants. They did not disperse in spite of warning ;
and the Emperor after waiting vainly for an hour to go to the
public prayer, ordered elephants to be driven through the
mass of men, trampling them down and clearing a way for
him. A temperate and reasoned Jelter from Shivaji urging
the impolicy of the new impost and appealing to Aurangzib
to think of the common Father of mankind and the equality
of all sincere beliefs in God’s eyes, met with no better
success. (M/de Appendix VI of Vol. Il, or SGtvayé, ch. 13).

The tax yielded a very large sum. In the provinee of
Gujrat, for instance, it was 5 lakhs of Rupees a year; and
we shall nol be far wrong in holding that the jagiva meant
for the Hindus an addition of fully one-third to every subject's
direct contribution to the State. To be a Muslin was to be
free from this extra taxation.

The officially avowed policy in reimposing the jaxziya was
fo increase the number of Muslims by putting pressure on
the Hindus.* As the contemporary, observer Manucci noticed,
“Many Hindus who were unable lo pay turned Muhammadan,
to obtain relief from the insults of the collectors... Aurangzib
rejoices,”

* As the official history written from Stale papers al dhe instanee of his
javourite secrelary puts it, “All the aims of the religious Timperor beng directed
lo the spread of the law of Islam and the overthrow of infidel practices, he issued
orders that from ist Rabi-ul-awwal (2 Aptil 1679), jaziga should be levied from the

some modern wrilers that the jaafgpa was only commutation money paid for

LAWS AGAINST TINDUS 159%

8 7. Repressive measures agains! the Lindus.

By an ordinance issued on 10th April, 1665, the mafisul
or custom duty on all commodities brought in for sale was
fixed at 2! p.c. of the va/ue in the case of Muslims and
5p. c in that of Hindu vendors.

On 9th May, 1667, the Emperor abolished the custom
duty altogether in the case of Muslim traders, while that on
the Hindus was retained at the old level. The real loss to
the State was likely fo be still greater as the Hindu traders
had now a strong temptation to pass their goads off as the
property of Muslims, in collusion with the latter.

A third instrument of the policy of putting economic
pressure on unbelievers, was the granting of rewards to
converts and the offering of posts in the public service,
liberation from prison, or succession to disputed properly,
on condition of turning Muslim.

In 1671 ah ordinance was issted that the rent collectors of
the Crownlands must be Muslims, and all viceroys and fa/uqdars
were ordered to dismiss their Hindu head clerks (pesAXars) and
accountants (dfwanian) and replace them by Muslims. ft was
found impossible to run the administration after dismissing the
Hindu pesffats of the provincial governors, but in some places
Muslims replaced Hindu &roris (district rent-collectors), Later
on, tbe Emperor yielded so far fo trecessity as to allow half
fhe peshkars of the revenue minister and paymaster’s
departments to be Hindus and the other half Muhammadans.
Under Aurangzib, “qanungo-ship on condition of turning Muslim’
became a proverbial expression; and several families in the
Panjab still preserve his letters patentin which this condition
of office is unblushingly laid down.

Some of the converts were, by the Emperor's ordets,
placed on elephants and carried in procession jhrough the

city to the accompaniment of a band and flags. Others got
daily stipends, four annas at the lowest. .

In Mareh 1695 all Hindus, with the exception of the
Rajputs, were forbidden to ride pa/éis, elephants or thorough-
bred horses, or to carry arms.

On certain days of the calendar, the [indus all over India
bold fairs near their holy places. Men, women and children
in vast numbers gather together ; booths are sct up and packs
opened by the traders. Here the village women meet their
distant friends and kinsfolk, and enjoy the show. Aurangzib
in 1668 forbade such fairs throughout his dominions.

The Hindu festival of lamps (diwali) and spring carnival
(folf) were ordered to be held only outside bazars and under
some restraints.

8 8. Hindus of Mathura disteict oppressed :
peasant visings.

Such open attacks on Hinduism by all the forces of
Government naturally produced great disconient among the
persecuted sect. Some frantic attempts were macle on the
Emperot’s life, but they were childish and ended in failure,

Early in 1669 a most formidable popular rising took
place in the Mathura district.

Abdun Nabi Khan, who was faujdar of Mathura from
August 1660 to May 1669, entered heartily into his mastet’s
policy of “rooting out idolatry.”

Soon after joining his post he built a Jama Masjicl in the
heart of the city of Mathura (1661-1662) on the ruins of a
Hindu temple. Later, in 1666, he forcibly removed the carved
stone railing presented by Dara Shukoh to Keshav Rai’s
temple. When in 1669 the Jat peasantry rose under the
leadership of Gokla, the zamindar of Tilpat, Abdun Nabi
marched out to attack them in the village of Bashara, but


--- Page 168 ---
1669] GOKLA JAT’S RISING 161

was shot dead during the encounter (about 10th May). Gobkla,
flushed with victory, looted the pargana of Sadabad, and the
disorder spread to the adjacent Agra district.

At this Aurangzib sent strong forces under high officers to
quell the rebellion. Throughout the year 1669 lawlessness
reigned in the Mathura district On 4th December Hasan
Ali Khan attacked some rebel villagers. They fought till
noon, when being unable to resist any longer, many of them
slaughtered their women and rushed upon the swords of the
Mughals, fighting with the recklessness of despair.

Next month Hasan Ali Khan defeated Gokla. The rebels,
who mustered 20,000 sirong, mostly Jat and other stalwart
peasants, encountered the imperial forces at a place 20 miles
from Tilpat. But after a very fong and bloody contest they
gave way before the superior discipline anc artillery of the
Mughals, and fled to ‘Tilpat, which was besieged for three
days and at last stormed at ihe point of the sword. The
havoc was terrible. On the victors’ side 4,000 men fell and
on the rebels’ 5,000, while 7,000 persons, including Gokla
and his family, were taken prisoner. The Jat leader’s limbs
were hacked off one by one on the platform of the police
office of Agra, and his family was forcibly converted to Islam.

IJasan Ali's strong measures had the desired effect, and
peace was soon restored to the district, but for a time only.
In 1686 the second Jat rising began, under the leadership of
Rajaram, which will be described later.

$9. The Satnami, sect ; their eising, 1672.

The Safnamis that rose against Aurangzib were really
dadfis, who employ the name Satnami among themselves.
They are a unitarian community, founded in 1543 by Birbhan
of Bijesar, near Narnol, and may be looked upon as an
offshoot of the Rai Dasis. The people nicknamed them

tl


--- Page 169 ---
162 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB cn. VILL

Mundigas or Shavelings from their practice of shaving off all
the hair,—even the eye-brows, from their heads. Their
stronghold in the {7th century was the district of Narnol,
75 miles south-west of Delhi.

Khafi Khan gives them a good character as an honest and
manly brotherhood, saying, “Though they dress like faqirs,
most of them follow agriculture or trade on a small capital,
Following the path of their own faith, they wish to live with
a good name and never aitempt to oblain money by any
dishonest or unlawful means.”

These people came into conflict with the forces of
Government from a purely temporal cause. “One day a
Satnami cultivator near Narnol had a hot dispute with a foot-
soldier (piada) who was watching a field, and the soldier
broke the peasant’s head with his thick stick. A party of
Satnamis beat the assailartt till he seemed doad, ‘The sAtadar
(petty revenue collector), hearing of it, sent a body of piadas
fo arrest the men; but the Satnamis assembled in force,
beat the piadas, wounded some of them, and snatched
away their arms. Their number and tumult inereased every
hour.”

The quarrel soon took on a religious colour and assumed
the form of a war for the liberation of the Ilindus by an
attack on Aurangzib himself. An old prophetess appeared
among them and declared that her spells would render the
Satnamis fighting uncer her banner invulnerable to the enemy’s
weapons, and that if one of them fell eighty others would
spring up in his place. The movement spread like wildfire
and the Government was completely taken by surprise. Soon
some five thousand |Satnamis were up in arms. The local
officers underrated the danger and sent out lroops in small
patties which were successively defeated, These initial victories
only raised the confidence of the rebels and confirmed the
tale of their magical powers. The faujdar of Narnol was


--- Page 170 ---
1679] SATNAMI REBELS CRUSHED 163

routed with heavy loss and that town seized by them. The
victorious rebels plundered Narnol, demolished its mosques,
and established their own administration in the district, holding
it by means of outposts and collecting the revenue from the
peasants, The noise of their tumult reached Delhi, where the
grain supply became scanty and the citizens were greatly
alarmed and distracted. Superstitions terror of their magical
powers demoralized the imperial army,

Aurangzib was now fully roused. On 15th March he
sent a large force, 10,000 strong, under Radandaz Khan and
many other high officers with artillery and a detachment
from the Emperors body-suard against the rebels. To
counteract the spells of the Satnamis, the Emperor, who had
the reputation of being a living saint (Alamgir szinda pit),
wrote out prayers and magical figures with his own hand
and ordered the papers to be sewed on to the banners of
hig army and displayed before the enemy. The encounter
was terrible. After a mast obstinate battle, two thousand of
the Satnamis fell on the field, while many more were slain
during the pursuit, “Very few of them escaped; and that
tract of country was cleared of the infidels.”

810. The course of the Sikfi religion ; change in the
character and aims of its head.

Towards the close of the 15th century, there arose in
the Panjab a Hindu reformer named Baba Nanak, who called
upon the people to prefer the essence fo the form of religion,
a living faith to a dead mechanical ritual, and the spiril to the
letter of their scriptures; he insisted on the unity of the
Godhead underlying the multitude of the idols of popular
worship, invited earnest believers io his fold without
distinction of caste or creed, and: tried to form a brother-
hood: of the elect. The aims of Nanak were abandotied by

1

164 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cn VID

his sect when his successors in the Jeadership of the Sikhs
set up a temporal dominion for themselves and made military
drill take the place of moral self-reform and spiritual growth.
“Today there is no spirit of progress among the  Silhs.
They have crystallized into a small sect Centuries have
failed to produce a new spirlual teacher from among them.”
[R. Tagore].

Nanak, a Hindu of the Khatri or trader casle, was born
in 1469 at Talwandi (now, Nanakana), 35 miles 5. w. of
Lahor. The essence of his creed was belief in the one true
living God, and the shaping of every man’s conduel in such
a way as to realize that God.

As he said, repealing the words of Kabir, “God can be
obtained by humility and prayer, self-restraint, searching of
the heart, and fixed gaze on Him.” Nanak (who lived til
1538) drew round himself a band of carnest worshippers, and
in time they solidified into a sect,

The Sikh gurus throughout the 16th century, from Nanak
fo Arjun the Sth guru, won the reverence of the Mughal
emperors by their saintly lives, and they had no quarrel
ejther with Islam or the State.

Before the reign of Auranezib the Sikhs were never
persecuted on celigfous grounds, and their collision with the
Mughal Government, which began in Jahangir’s time was cue
entirely to secular causes, anc the change in the character of
the gurus was solely responsible for it.

Under Arjun, the Sth suru (581-1606), the number of
Sikh converls greatly increased, and with them the guru’s
wealth, He organized a permanent source of income. A
band of agents were stalionecdl in every city from Kabul to
Dacca where there was a Sikh, to collect the tithes and
offerings of the faithful; and this spiritual tribute, so far as it
escaped pectlation by the agents, reached the central treasury
at Amritsar. The guru was trealed as a temporal king and


--- Page 172 ---
SIKH GURUS OUARREL WITH EMPEROR 165

girt round by a body of courliers and ministers called masands,
which is the Hindi corruption of the title masnad-i-ala borne
by nobles under the Pathan Sultans of Delhi. Arjun in
a weak moment blessed the banners of Khusrau, the rival
of Jahangit for the Mughal throne, and even gave money help
to that prince. On the defeat of the pretender, Jahangir fined
the guru two lakhs of Rupees for his disloyalty to the king
de jure. The guru refused to pay the fine and stoically endured
imprisonment and torture, which were the usual punishments
of revenue defaulters in those days. Worn out by being
forced to sit in the burning sand of Lahor, he died in
June 1606,

With his son Har Govind (1606-1645), a new era began.
“Unlike his father, Har Govind constantly trained himself in
martial exercises and systematically turned his attention to the
chase.” He increased his body-guard of 52 warriors till it
became a small army. As he told a follower, “In the guru's
house religion and worldly enjoyment shall be combined.”
Soon afler Shah Jahan’s accession, when that Emperor was
hawking near Amritsar, the gura entered the same area in
pursuit of game, and his Sikhs quarrelled with the servants of
the imperial hunt about a bird. The two parties came to
blows, and in the end the imperialists were beaten off with
slaughter. An army was sent agains! the audacious rebel, but
it was routed with heavy loss, at Sangrana, near Amritsar,
1628, ‘The victor’s fame spread far and wide. “Many men
came to enlist under the guru’s banner. They said that no
one else had power to contend with the Emperor.” Such an
open defiance ‘of imperial authority could not be tolerated
near Lahor. Larger and larger armies were sent against the
guru, and though he gained some successes at first, his house
and property at Amritsar were, in the end, seized, and he
was forced fo take refuge at Kiratpur in the Kashmir hills
beyond the reach of Mughal arms. Here he died in 1645.


--- Page 173 ---
166 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB (cn. VI

On the death of guru [lar Kishan in 1664, a scene of
disorder and rapacity broke out among the Sikhs.  “Twenty-
two [men] of Bakala claimed the right to succeed him. These
selt-made gurus foreibly {ook the offerings of the Sikhs.”
After a time Tegh Bahadur, ihe youngest son of [lar Govind,
succeeded in being recognized as guru by mosl of the Sikhs.

While residing in Anandpur he was roused to action by
the sight of his creed being wantonly attacked and its holy
places desecrated. He encouraged the resistance of the
Hindus of Kashmir to forcible conversion to Islam and openly
defied the Emperor. Taken to Delhi, he was cast into prison
and called upon to embrace Islam, and on his refusal was
tortured for five days and then beheaded on a warrant from
the Emperor (1676),

Now at last open war broke oul between the Sikhs
and Islam. Soon a leader appeared atnong the Sikhs who
organized the sect into the most efficient and implacable
enemy of the Mughal empire and the Muslim faith, Govind
Rai, the fenih and last guru (1676-—-1708) and the only
son of Tegh Bahadur, was aman of whom it had been
prophesied before his birth that “he would convert jackals
into tigers and sparrows into hawks.”

We may here pause to consider whal causes made the
success of Guru Govind possible, The first was the gradual
elevation of the suru to a superhuman position. The  Silehs
were faught to obey their guru with blind unquestioning
devotion. This implicit faith in a common superior knit the
Sikhs logether like the soldiers of a regiment. The Sikhs were
famous in the 17th century for their sense of brotherhood
and love for each other. They felt themselves to be a
chosen people, the Lord’s elect. In the language of Bhat
Gurudas : “Where there are two Sikhs, there is a company
of saints ; where there are five Sikhs, there is God !” The
unity due to sameness of religion was further cemented by


--- Page 174 ---
GURU GOVIND'S LIFE AND TEACHING 167

the abolition of caste distinctions under orders of Govind.
All restrictions about food and drink, so prevalent in Hindu
society, had already been discarded. [f Cromweil’s lIronsides
could have been inspired with the Jesuits’ unquestioning
acceptance of their Superior’s decisions on moral and spiritual
questions, the result would have equalled Guru Govind’s
Sikhs as a fighting machine.

§ (1. Guru Govind, fits ideal and cateec.

Govind steadily drilled his followers, gave thema distinctive
dress and a new oath of baptism, and began a policy of
open hostility to Islam. He harangued the Hindus to rise
against Muslim persecution, and imposed a fine of Rs. 125
on his followers for saluting any Muhammadan saint's tomb.
His aims were frankly material. “Mother dear, I have been
considering how | may confer empire on the Khalsa.” He
lived in princely state.

In the hills of North Panjab, Govind passed most of his
life, constantly fighting with the hill-Rajahs from Jammu to
Srinagar in Garhwal, who were disgusted with his followers’
violence and scared by his own ambition. Large imperial
forces were sent from Sarhind to co-operate with the quotas
of the hillRajahs and suppress the guru ; but they were
usually worsted. His army went on increasing, as recruits
from the Panjab doabs flocked to him and received baptism.
Even Muslims were enlisted. Anandpur was five times
invested. After the last attack, the guru evacuated the fort, and
closely pursued by the Mughals, passed through many adventures
and hairbreadth escapes, changing his place of shelter repeatedly
like a hunted animal. His four sons perished. Then Govind
with his few but faithful guards undertook a journey to South-
etn India. In 1707 the new Emperor Bahadur Shah I induced
him to accompany him on the march to Rajputana and the
Deccan, The guru reached Nander on the Godavari, 150 niles

n, w. of Haidarabad in August 1707 at the head of some
infantry and 2 fo 3 hundred cavalry, and there after a stay of
more than a year he was stabbed to death by an Afghan
(1708). With him the line of gurus ended.

Thus we see thal the Mughal Government under Aurangzib
did succeed in breaking up the guru’s power. It robbed the
Sikhs of a common leader and a rallying centre. Thereafter
the Sikhs continued to disturb public peace, but only in isolated
bands. They were no longer an army fighting under one chief,
with a definite political aim, but mercly moving bodies of
brigands,—extremely brave, enthusiaslic, and hardy, but essentially
plunderers uninspired by any ambition to build up an organized
Government in the land. If Ranjit Singh had not risen, there
would have been no Jargeand uniled State under Sikh clominion,
but a number of petty principalities in the Panjab with a
ruling aristocracy of Sikh soldiers, sending their organized
marauders every year to raid and lay lhe country waste.

The worst consequence of Aurangzib’s bigotry was the war
that he provoked with the two greatest Rajput clans.

CHAPTER IX
WAR IN RAJPUTANA ; REBELLION OF AKBAR.
§1. Aurangszib seizes Matwat, 1679.

(Marwar is a desert land, but in Mughal times its strategic
importance Jay in the fact that the shortest and easiest trade-
route from the Mughal capital to the rich manufacturing city
of Ahmadabad and the busy port of Cambay lay through
its limits, \From Agra the western road through the loyal
Stale of Jaipur up to the imperial city of Ajmir was safe and
well-frequented. ‘Thereafter it crossed a gap in the Aravali
barrier and ran level through the Marwar cities of Pali and
Jhalor to Ahmadabad. If such a province could be annexed to
the imperial dominions, the proud lord of Udaipur would be taken
in flank, and a long wedge of Muslim territory would be driven /
right across Rajputana, cleaving it into two isolaled halves‘.
which could be crushed in detail. Maiwar was the foremost
Hindu_State ie of Northern India at this time time. c. Its “Chieftain w was

Jaswant Singh, | who enjoyed _ the “unrivalled tank of a
“Maharajah ‘and whom the death of Jai Singh thirteen years
ago had left as the leading Hindu peer of the Mughal Court.
The success of Aurangzib’s plan of the forcible conversion of
the Hindus required that Jaswant’s State should sink into a
quiescent dependency ‘or a regular province of the empire.
Hindu resistance to the policy of religious persecution mus
be deprived of a possible efficient head.

On 10th December, 1678, Maharajah Jaswant Singh died
at Jamrud * when commanding the Mughal posts in the Khaibar

* He was never viceroy of Afghanistan or even governor of Kabul cify, but
maiely anadar of Jamrud,.

170 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cr IX

Pass. Immediately on hearing of Jaswant’s death Aurangzib
took steps to seize his kingdom and place it under direct
Mughal rule. (On Oth January, 1679, the Emperor himself set
out for Ajmir, in order to be close enough to Jodhpur to
overawe opposition. }

The death of Jaswant hac thrown the Rathors into
confusion and dismay. The State was without a head.
Jaswant’s highest officers and best troops were absent in
‘Afghanistan. At first no resistance could be offered to the
vast and well-directed Mughal armies that poured into the land.

Aurangzib had learnt (on 26th February) that two of
Jaswant’s widows had given birth to two posthumous sons
at Lahor, But the Emperor was not to be moved from his
policy of annexing Marwar by any regard for the law of
legitimate succession. He returnect from Ajmir to Delhi
(Qnd April. On that day the invidious poll-tax on the
Hindus was imposed again affer a century of abeyance.

Indra Singh Rathor, the chieftain of Nagor, and grand-
nephew of Jaswant, was invested as Rajah of Jodhpur in
return for a succession fee of 36 lakhs of Rupees (26th May),
and sent to Marwar. But the Mughal a¢lministrators and
generals in occupation of the country were retained there,
evidently to help the new Rajah in taking possession of
his State.

§ 2. How Durgadas saved Ajit Singh.

On reaching Lahor iwo of the widowed Ranis of Jaswant
gave birth to two sons (February, 1679), one of whom died
in a few weeks, while the other, Ajit Singh, lived to mount
the throne of Jodhpur after a most eventful and romantic
career. At the end of June the Maharajah’s family reached
Delhi, and the rights of Ajil were again urged before
Aurangzib ; but he only ordered that the child should be

1679} ‘ AJIT SINGH'S ESCAPE FROM DBLHE 171

brought up in his harem, with a promise to give him a rank
in the Mughal peerage and investiture as Raiah when he
would come of age. One contemporary historian says that
the throne of Jodhpur was offered to Ajit on condition of
his turning Muslim.

The ioyal Rathors were seized with consternation at
Aurangztb’s proposal. They vowed to die to a man to save
their chieftain’s heir. Their leader and guiding genius was
Durgadas, the flower of Rathor chivalry, and son of Jaswant's
minister Askaran, the baron of Drunera. But for his twenty-
five years’ unflagging exertion and wise contrivance, Ajit Singh
could not have secured his father’s throne. Fighting against
terrible odds and a host of enemies on every side, with distrust
and wavering among his own countrymen, he kept the cause
of his chieftain triumphant. Mughal gold could not seduce,
Mughal arms could not daunt that constant heart. Almost
alone among the Rathors he displayed the tate combination of
the dash and reckless valour of a Rajput soldier with the tact,
diplomacy and organizing power of a Mughal minister of State.

On 13th July the Emperor sent a strong force under the
provost of Delhi city and the captain of the imperial guards to
sefse the Ranis and Ajit and lodge them in the prison fortress
of Nurgarh. The Rathor plan was to ensure the escape of Ajit
by offering desperate resistance and sacrificing their own lives
freely in a series of yvear-guard actions. Raghunath, a Bhatti
noble of Jodhpur, with a hundred devoted troopers made a sortie
from one side of the mansion, Before their wild charge the
imperialists quailed, and seizing this momentaty confusion
Durgadas slipped out with Ajit and the Ranis dressed fn male
attire, and rode direct for Marwar. Por an hour and a half
Raghunath dyed the streets of Delhi with blood, but at last he
fell. The Mughals now set off in purstif, but Durgadas
had covered nine miles by the time he was overtaken.
It was now Ranchhordas Jodha’s turn to face round with


--- Page 179 ---
179 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB {cm IX

a small band and gain precious time by barring the enemy's
path. This happened thrice ; in the evening the Mughals,
worn out by the three murderous conflicts, abandoned
the pursuit, and Ajit was safely conducted to Marwar (93rd
July). His name became the rallying cry of the Rathor  legili-
mists. Aurangzib’s policy in Marwar scemed to have been
wrecked, But his stalecraft strucle a shrewd blow to counter
the action of Durgadas : he brought up a milkman’s infant in
his harem as the true Ajit Singh ancl proclaimed Durgacas’s
protege to be a bogus prince. At the same time he dethroned
Indra Singh, the two months’ Rajah of Marwar, for his
manifest incapacity to rule.

A strong Mughal force was sent into Marwar for the
reconquest of the State. Anarchy and slaughter were let loose
on the doomed province.

The Emperor took up his headquarters at Ajmir on 95th
September ; his army advanced fighling under his son Muhammad
Akbar. The Mughal van was led by Tahawwur Khan, the
faujdac of Ajmir. The Mairtia clan of Rathors, under one Raj
Singh, barred his palh in front of the temple of the Boar near
the sacred lake of Pushkar, and a three days’ continuous battle
ended only with the extinclion of the brave defenders. There-
after the Rajputs always carried on a guerilla warfare from
their lurking places in the hills and desert. The Emperor now
divided Marwar into dislricls over cach of which a Mughal
officer was placed as foufdar (end of October). No resistance
could stand against such heavy odds, and the whole country
was soon occupied by the foe. “Jodhpur and all the great
towns in the plain fell and were pillaged; the temples were
thrown down and mosques erected on their siles.’

8 3. Mughal war with Mahavana of Udaipue.

The annexation of Marwar was but the preliminary to an easy
conquest of Mewar. On the revival of the jazrya tax, a demand


--- Page 180 ---
1680] MAHARANA RAJ SINGH FIGHTS 173

for its enforcement throughout his State had been sent fo the
Maharana. If the Sisodias did not stand by the Rathors now,
the two clans would be crushed piecemeal, and the whole of
Rajasthan would fie helpless under the tyrant’s feet. So
thought Maharana Raj Singh, and so thought his clansmen.
The mother of Ajit Singh was a Mewar princess, and Raj
Singh could not, either as a kinsman or as a knight, reject her
appeal to defend the orphan’s rights.

Raj Singh began his preparations for war. Aurangzib with
his usual promptitade struck the first blow. Seven thousand
picked soldiers under Hasan Ali Khan marched in advance
from Pur, ravaging the Rana’s territory and clearing the way
for the main Mughal army. The Rajputs had nolhing that
could make a stand against the exeellent Mughal artillery
served by European gunners. Hence the Rana had prepared
for the invasion by abandoning the low country and retiring
with all his subjects to the hills, whither the Mughals durst not
penetrate. Even the capital Udaipur was found evacuated.
The Mughals took possession of it and destroyed its great
temple, and also three temples on the Udai-sagar lake.

Hasan Ali Khan entered the hills north-west of
Udaipur in search of the Rajput army ; on being
reinforced and freshly provisioned, he inflicted a defeat
on the Maharana (22nd January), capturing his camp
and property and much grain on the way, and destroy-
ing 173 temples in the environs of Udaipur. Chitor had
been already occupied by the Mughals, and 63 temples of
the place were destroyed when Aurangzib visited it at the end
of February. The Emperor left Udaipur and returned to
Ajmir (on 28nd March), while a strong force under Prince
Akbar held the Chitor district as a base. But the imperial
outposts were too far scattered to be defended easily, while
the whole of the Rajput land was seething with hostilily. The
Mughal positions in Mewar and Marwar were isolated from


--- Page 181 ---
{74 SHOR! HISTORY ON AURANGZIB fen, IX

each other by the wedge of the Aravali range, whose crest
the Rana held in force, and from which he could make
sudden descents and deal crushing blows on the east or
on the west as he pleased, while the Mughals in transferring
troops from Chitor to southern Marwar had to make a long and
toilsome detour through the Bednor, Beawar, and Sojat
districts.

The rough circle formed by the massed hills of Mewar
and stretching from Uclaipur westwards fo Katnalmir and
from the Rajsamudra lake southwards 1o Salumbra, resembled
a vast impregnable fort with three gates, opening east, north
and west, wiz. Deobari, Rajsamudra, and Deosuri, «through
which the garrison could sally out in full force and crush
any isolated Mughal outpost. The Mughals, on the other hand,
could effect a concentration only by moving along a Jong
are of which the Rana held the short base,

Prince Akbar had been left at Chitor in charge of all the
Mughal posts east of the Aravali and south of Ajmir. But his
force was too small for the effective defence of this vast region.
The Rajputs, fighting in their homeland, knew every nook of
the ground and were helped by a friendly peasantry. The
Mughals were strangers in that wild broken countey and
marched among a hostile population,

A marked increase of Rajput activity began with the
Emperor's retirement to Ajmir (in March). They made raids,
cul off supply trains and stragglers, and made the Mughal
outposts extremely unsafe, thus creating a terror of their
prowess. The command of Mughal outposts went abegging,
captain after captain declining the dangerous honour; the
Mughal troops refused to enter any pass; detachments sat
down only a short distance from the base and refused to
advance further.

About the middle of next May Akbar’s camp near
Chitor was surprised at night and some slaughter done by the

Rajpuis who had entered it by a rise. The Maharana descen-
ded from the hills and roamed the Bednor district, threatening
Akbar’s communications with Ajmir. At the end of this month
(May), a terrible reverse befell the Mughal arms : Akbar was
surprised by the Rana and evidently suffered a heavy loss.
A few days later, the Rajputs catried off a convoy of Banjavas
with 10,000 pack-oxen bringing grain to the prince’s army
from Malwa. One of the Rana’s armies under his son Bhim
Singh ranged the country, striking swift and sudden blows at
weak points. “Our army is motionless through fear,” so Akbar
complains.

At these signal instances of Akbar’s failure, the Emperor in
high wrath sent him off to Marwar and placed the command
of Chitor in the hands of another son, Prince Azam (26th June),

The itmperial plan henceforth was to penetrate the Mewar
hills in three columns—from the Chitor or eastern side Prince
Azam would advance by way of the Deobari pass and
Udaipur, from the north Prince Muazzam by way of the lake
Rajsamudra, and from the west Akbar through ,the Deosurf
pass. The first two failed to achieve their tasks.

§ 4. Prince Akbar'’s campaign in Marwar.

Prince Akbar, on transfer from Chitor, took post at Sojat
in Marwar on 18th July, 1680. But in Marwar he met with
no better success than in Mewar. The Rathor bands spread
over the country, closing the trade routes and Reeping the
land in perpetual turmoil. Akbar’s instructions were to make
the central position at Sojat secure, then occupy Nadol, the
chief town of the Godwar district, and from this new base to
send his vanguard under Tahawwur Khan to advance east-
wards into Mewar by the city of Narlai, force the Deosuri
pass and invade the Kamalmir region, where the Maharana
and the defeated Rathors had taken refuge. But so gréat was

the terror inspired by the “death-loving” Rajputs that
Tahawwutr’s troops sat down in fear and inactivity.

Akbar left Sojal on @ist September, and reached Nadol
at the end of the month. But Tahawwur Khan refused to
enter the hills, and Akbar had to use compulsion towards his
timid lieutenant On 87th September the Khan acvanced
towards the mouth of the pass to reconnoitre. When he had
yielded to Rajput seduction and decided to play the traitor,
we do not know. But from September [680 we notice a
suspicious slackening of his activity. /

Then the Emperor’s patience was worn out. [le sent to
Akbar the imperial Bakhshi with orders to enforce a forward
movement of the division. Further delay could not be
excused, So, Akbar advanced his base from Nadol to
Deosuri (19th November), and from the latter vitlage sent
Tahawwur Khan on to force the Jhilwara pass; the Mughals
advanced to Jhilwara, fighting and carrying the barricades
across the path, and the Khan, from his station at Jhilwara,
began fo ravage the neighbouring country freely.

The advance to Jhilwara was made on 98nd November,
The next step would have been to push on eight miles south
to Kamalmir, the last refuge of the Rana. But during the
next five weeks we have again the same suspicious inactivity
on Tahawwut Khan's part. In truth, the  prince’s
treasonable plot was fully hatched during this period. On
{st January 1681 he united with the Rajput rebels, issued a
manifesto deposing his father, and crowned himself Emperor ;
and the next day he set out for Ajmir to wrest the Mughal
crown from Aurangzib’s brows.

85. Prince Akbar proclaims fimself Emperor, 1681,

Sullan Muhammad Akbar, the fourth son of Aurangzib,
was only 23 years of age at this time. In his campaign in
Mewar he had given signal proofs of slackness and incapacity,


--- Page 184 ---
1680] AKBAR’S PLOT FOR THE THRONE 177

for which the Emperor had sharply censured him. In Marwar,
where he was sent next, he failed eilher fo crush the roving
Rathor bands or to penetrate into Mewar by the Deosuri Dass
as planned by his father. Smarting under disgrace for these
repealed failures, he lent a ready ear to the tempting invitation }
of the Rajputs to scize his father’s throne with their help. ‘

Tahawwur Khan, his chief officer, was the intermediary o|
these {reasonable negotiations, The Maharana Raj Singh and
Durgadas, the Rathor leader, told Akbar how his father’s
bigoted attempt to root out the Rajputs was threatening the
stability of the Mugha! empire, and urged him to seize the
throne and restore the wise policy of his forefathers if he
wished fo save his heritage from destruction. They promised
to back him with the armed strengih of the two greatest Rajput
clans, the Sisocdias and the Rathors.

Everything had been arranged for a march against
Aurangzib at Ajmir, when the Maharana died, @2nd October,
1680), and during the month of mourning that followed, his
successor fai Singh naturally remained Inactive. Thereafter,
Tahawwur Khan having reached the Jhilwara Pass, not far
from the Rajput headquarters at Kamalmir, the negotiations
were easily resumed and quickly concluded. The Rana
agreed to send half his army, both foot and horse, under his
son ot brother to fight the prince’s battles. The 2nd of
January 1681 was fixed as the day when Akbar would begin
his match on Ajmir to cantest the imperial throne.

Two days before this date he wrote a false letter to his
father to disarm his suspicion: “The brother and son of the
new Rana, under the guidance of Tahawwur Khan, have
descended from the hills and come to me, The Rathor
Jeaders also have come here to make terms through the
mediation of the Khan. They urge that unless 1 myself conduct
them to your Majesty and personally beg pardon on their
behalf, they cannot compose their minds for coming over to

178 SHORT IISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cn IX

our side. 1 am, therefore, starting [with them] for your
Presence.”

Then Akbar threw off the mask. Four theologians in his
pay issued a decree over their seals, declaring that Aurangzib
had forfeited the throne by his violation of the Islamic Canon
Law. Akbar crowned himself Emperor (fst January), and
created Tahawwur Khan his Premier Noble. Most of the
imperial officers with him were powerless to resist or to
escape, and feigned adhesion to his cause,

The Emperor’s situation at Ajmir was critical. The two
main divisions of his armyy which were untainted by treason,
were quartered far away. His immediate rctinue consisted
merely of unserviceable soldiers, with his personal attendants,
clerks and eunuchs, while rumour swelled the rebel army to
70,000 men, including the best blades of Rajputana.

Every one expected a rapid advance of Akbar's troops,
the rout of the small imperial body-guard, and a change of
sovereigns. But Akbar began to spend his days and nights
in indolence and pleasure. He took a fortnight (2-15 January)
in covering the 120 miles which separated him from his
father, when every hour’s delay told in Aurangzib’s favour,

For, meantime, courfers had galloped off on all sides to
recall the scattered Mughal detachments to the Presence.
Loyal captains were straining every nerve and marching day
and night to join the Emperor in time. Shihab-ud-din Khan,
the father of the first Nizam, reached Ajmir (th January)
with his troops after a forced march from Sirohi, in which
he covered 120 miles in two days. Some other officers were
equally quick, Thus the acute stage of ihe crisis was soon
over. The palace at Ajmir was put in a posture of defence ;
entrenchments were dug around the camp; the passes leading
to the city were held in force; on 14th January, the Emperor
issued forth fnio the open, and encamped six miles south
of Ajmir on the historic field of Deorai, But despair and


--- Page 186 ---
1681} PRINCE AKBAR TO ATTACK AURANGZIG 179

defection raged in the camp of Akbar. As he came nearer,
increasing numbers of Mughal officers began fo desert him
and escape fo the imperial camp. The thirty thousand Rajputs,
however, remained true to him.

The crisis came on the {5th of January. The Emperor
advanced four miles farther south and waited at Do-rahah.

In the evening, Prince Muazzam after a forced march
through rain and wind and the bitter cold of midwinter, joined
the Emperor, doubling his strength, On the other side,
Akbar arrived three miles from his father’s camp, halted there
for the night, and fixed the next morning for the decisive
battle.

$6. Murder of Tafhawwur Khan, faiture of Akbar.

Bul during the night Aurangzib’s cunning diplomacy
secured the completest victory without resort to arms.
Tahawwur Khan, the right-hand man of Akbar, had married
a daughter of Inayet Khan, a high officer then in the imperial
camp. Aurangzib made Inayet write to Tahawwur Khan
urging him to come to the Emperor, with a promise of
pardon for the past, anda threat that if he declined “his
women would be publicly outraged and his sons sold into
slavery at the price of dogs,”

The letter bewildered Tahawwur Khan. After putting on a
coat of scale armour under his robe, as a precaution against
treachery, he secretly left his tent without informing Akbar or
Durgadas, arrived at the imperial camp a little before mid-
night, and demanded audience, but refused to put up with
the indignity of being ushered into the Presence unarmed
like a captive. The dispute became loud. At last the crowd
of royal attendants attracted to the spot by the noise rained
down blows on him with their maces. The hidden  cuirass
saved him for a time, but at last some one cut his throat and
“silenced his uproar.”


--- Page 187 ---
180 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB lou. IX

Meantime, Aurangzib had written a false letter to Akbar. In
it the prince was praised for the suecess he had hitherto gained
in carrying out his father’s stratagem of luring all the Rajput
fighters into a snare and bringing them within easy reach of
the Emperor; and he was now instructed to crown his achieve-
ment by placing them in his van in next morning’s battle, so
that they might be crushed when altacked by Aurangzib from
the front and Akbar from the rear. As contrived by Aurangzib,
the letter fell into Durgadas’s hands, who read tt and went to
Akbar’s tent for an explanation. The prince was asleep and
his eanuchs had strict orders not to wake him. Durgadas next
sent men to call Tahawwur Khan. Then the Rajputs discovered
that the soul of the whole enterprise had stolen away to the
imperial camp some hours ago; the intercepted letter was
believed to have been verified by these facts. No time was to
be lost if the Rajputs were to escape from the treacherous plot
they had discovered by good luck. Three hours before dawn
they took horse, robbed what they could of Akbar’s property,
and galloped off to Marwar. Profiting by this chance, the
imperial troopers whom Akbar had forced to march under his
banners and the loyal captains whom he had placed under
arrest, escaped towards the camp of Aurangszib. Tahawwut
Khan had been ihe connecting link between the Rajputs and
Akbar; ha had been the new Emperor's commander-in-chiet
and prime minister in one, and his flight dissolved the
confederacy.

In the morning Akbar woke to find himself deserted by all.
His vast army had melted away in a single night, as if by magic,
and only his faithful old retainers, a band of 340 horse, were
left with him. Mounting his ladies on horses and loading what
treasure he could on camels, he rode away for dear life in the
track of the Rajputs.

The remnant of Akbar’s property which had escaped plunder
was seized, and his deserted family,—consisting of one wite,


--- Page 188 ---
1681] FLIGHT OF AKBAR 181

iwo sons, and three datghters-—was brought away to the
Emperor’s camp. Relentless punishment was meted out to his
followers. The Princess Zeb-un-nisa, whose secret correspond-
ence with Akbar was discovered, was deprived of her allowance
of four lakhs of Rupees and her landed property, and confined
in the Salimgarh fortress.

A well-appointed army under Prince Muazzam was next
sent into Marwar to hunt Akbar down. During the second night
after Akbar’s flight, Durgadas having discovered the fraud
played by Aurangzib, turned back and took Akbar under his
protection. Pajput honour demanded that the refugee should be
defended at all costs. Akbar with his protectors roamed through
Marwar, never passing twenty-four hours at the same place ;
but the Mughal officers in Gujrat were on the alert and headed
the rebel off. Then Durgadas niost chivalrously undertook
to conduct Akbar to the Maratha Court, the only Power in
India that had successfully defied Mughal arms, Every known
ferry ancl pass was guarded by imperial pickets; but the
Rathor leader with ihe greatest skill evaded them and misled
his pursuers as to his real objective, crossed the Narmada
(9th May) near the ferry of Akbarpur, and appeared within
a short distance of Burhanpur on the Tapti ({5th May). But
here, too, his path was barred by imperial officers, and he
marched due west through Khandesh and Baglana, finally
reaching Shambhuji’s protection in Konkan (1st June).

8 7. Peace with Mafiarana.

Akbar’s rebellion disconcerted the Mughal plan of war at a
fime when their net was being drawn closer round Marwar,
and it gave automatic relief to this State. It was probably
at this time that the Sisodias seized the opportunity of making
reprisals, under the gallant prince Bhim Singh and the
Maharana’s finance minister Dayaldas, ravaging Gujrat and
Malwa. .

( the Rajput war was a drawn game so far as the actual
fighting was concerned, but its material consequences were
disastrous {io the Maharana’s subjects ; their corn-fields in
the plains were ravaged by the enemy; they could stave
off defeat but not starvation. So, both sides desired peace.\ |
Maharana Jaf Singh personally visited Prince Muhammad Azam
(14th June, 1681), and made peace with the empire on the
following terms :

1. The Rana ceded to the empire the parganas of
Mandal, Pur and Bednor in lieu of the jazfya demanded
from his kingdom,

2, The Mughals withdrew from Mewar, which was
restored to Jai Singh with the title of Rana and the rank of a
Commander of Five Thousand.

_ Thus Mewar at last recovered peace arid freedom. Not
so Marwar. That unhappy theatre of war was turned into a
wilderness during the truceless conflict which constitutes
Jodhpur history for the next thirty years. “The sword and
pestilence united to clear the land.” Akbar’s junction with
Shambhuji raised a more formidable danger to the empire
and Aurangzib had to concentrate all his forces in the
Deccan and even to be present there in person. The.
Mughal hold on Marwar was consequently relaxed, This
was the salvation of the Rathors. Throughout the succeeding
generation we find the Mughal hold on Marwar pulsating
with the military situation in the Deccan.

The Rathor system of warfare, under Durgadas’s able
guidance, anticipated the Maratha method and its success by ’
harassing and exhausting the imperialists and even by
driving the helpless Mughal commanders to buy a_ secret
forbearance by paying chaulH to the Rathors. Thus the
war went on with varying fortunes, but without cessation
for 3O years, till August 1709, when Ajit Singh entered
Jodhpur in triumph for the last time and his lordship of

Marwar was formally and finally acknowledged by the
Emperor of Delhi.

“In the height of political unvisdom, Aurangzib wantonly
provoked rebellion in| Rajputana, while the Afghans on the
frontier were still far from being pacified, With the two
leading Rajput clans openty hostile to him, his army lost its
finest and most loyal recruits!’ Nor was the trouble confined
to Marwar and Mewar. It spread by sympathy among the
Hada and Gaur clans. The elements of lawlessness thus
set moving overflowed fitfully into Malwa and endangered
the vitally important Mughal road through Malwa _ to the
Deccan.

BOOK IV

CHAPTER X
RISE OF THE MARATHA POWER.

8 1. Fhe keynote of Deccan history in the Seventeenth
Century.

In the middle of the Fourteenth century the foundation of
the Bahmani kingdom created an independent centre of
Muslim power in Southern India, and Indian Islam started on
a new career of expansion in the south and repeated the
work of the Delhi Sultanate in North India by crushing ont
the great Hindu kingdoms of the Decean which had hitherto
retained their independence. This process went on throughout
the Fifteenth century. Even when, at the end of the first
quarter of the next cenlury, the great house of Bahmani fell,
its heritage passed into the worthy hands of Nizam Shah and
Adil Shah. Ahmadnagar and Bijapur tow became cenires
which fully kept up the traditions of Islamic dominion and
Islamic culture founded by the Sultans of Kulbarga. The first
quarter of the 17th century saw the final extinction of the Nizam
Shahs. Bijapur now rushed in to fill the leadership vacated by
Ahmadnagar.

But with the commencement of the Seventeenth century a
new combatant had entered the southern arena. The Mughal
Emperor was now free to conquer the Deccan, and this fact
dominated the whole history of Southern India throughout the
{7th century. Adil Shah (the ruler of Bijapur) found that he
must give up the dream of winning the hegemony of the
Deccan, as the heir of the Bahmanis and the Nizam-Shahs,

i


--- Page 192 ---
DECLINE OF BIJAPUR MONARCHY 185

and that he must find an outlet for his ambition eastwards
and southwards only, so as not to cross the path of the
dreaded Mughals of the north. By the partition-treaty of
1636, the southern boundary of Mughal Deccan had been
clearly marked out, and during the following twenty years
Bijapur had risen to the pinnacle of her greatness by streich-
ing her sway from sea to sea across the Indian peninsula,
while the capital city had become the mother of arts and
letters, of theology and science. But the wartior-kings of an
earlier, poorer and ruder generation were now followed by
successors who preferred the harem and the darbar to the
tented field and the saddle. The climax of the Adil-Shahi power
was also the beginning of its rapid decline and dismemberment.

A feudal State cannot be governed by a faineant king nor
by a constitutional prime minister. When the king is no longer
a hero, the military viceroys of the provinces will not obey
him. “ Therefore, after the death of the last great Adil Shah {in
November 1656), the dissolution of the remaining Muslim
kingdoms of the Deccan and their absorption into the Mughal
empire would have taken place as an inevitable, speedy
and almost silent operation of Nature, but for the entrance of
a new factor into Deccan polities.”

These were the Marathas. They dominated Deccan history
for the century anda half that followed the accession of
Aurangzib, and North Indian history for the last fifty years of
the 18th century, The Maratha people Had been there from
time oul of mind, but since the {3th century they had lived
dispersed through many States, as the subjects of aliens in
the land of their birth, without any political organization or
status of their own. A genius was needed to gather these
scattered units {ogether inlo a nation and drive them like
a solid wedge into the Mughal empire, shivering it to bits.
That genius was Shivaji, the contemporary and antagonist
of Aurangzib.


--- Page 193 ---
186 SHORT HISIORY OF AURANGZIB [cn

From the day when the Emperor Akbar launched forth
into a policy of conquest south of the Vindhyas to the day
94 years later, when Aurangzib rode in triumph into the
fallen capital of the last of the Qutb-Shahs, the Sullans of
Bijapur and Golkonda could never for a moment forget
that the sleepless aim of the Mughal Emperor was their final
extinction and the annexation of all their territories. They
found in the genius of Shivaji and the reckless audacity of
Shambhuji their only shield in the hour of supreme danger.
A union of hearts between Bijapur or Golkonda and _ the
Mughal empire against the Marathas was a_ psychological
impossibility.

European historians maintain that it would have been
wiser for Aurangzib lo have left Bijapur and Golkonda in
independence to serve as the police of the Deccan against
the growing Maratha lawlessness which finally proved too
strong for the Mughals. This view is based upon ignorance
of the true condition of the Deccan. By the time that Shivaji
had succeeded in forming a national State as a nucleus round
which the Maratha chiefs hitherto in Muslim pay might cluster,
the kingdoms of Bijapur and Golkonda had arrived at the
last stage of decline. Their kings were mere puppets sunk in
pleasure, their capitals ran blood during the frequent
faction-fights for the office of wasie, the administration
had utterly broken down, law and order had disappeared,
the provincial governors had become judependent, the generals
were selling themselves to the highest bidder. Such Govern-
ments could not be expected to tame Shambhuji and chastise
Shanta Ghorpare more effectually than Aurangzib himself
could do.

Briefly put, the grouping of Powers in the Deccan was
thus: The dread of Mughal aggression drove the Sultan of
Golkonda whole-heartedly, and that of Bijapur distrustfully
and intermittently, into the arms of Shivaji. Bijaput’s leagues —


--- Page 194 ---
RELATIONS AMONG DECCANI POWERS 187

with Shivaji were formed only when Mughal invasion was an
insistent fact and the situation of Adil Shah was desperate ;
and these leagues were soon dissolved by the growing fear
that Shivaji was trying fo enrich himself by treacherously
seizing iis forts and lands. Of the three Deccani Powers, Quib
Shah may be left out of our account, as he never sought a
rupture with the Mughals during this period. The Bijapur
Government fell into a hopeless decline* after 1666, when Ali
Adil Shah IL gave himself up entirely to wine, while rival
nobles began to fight for the wazirship and the control over
the capital and the foineant Ring. Matters grew worse when
the boy-king Sikandar succeeded in 1672, and the history of
Bijapur became in effect the history of its regents. Great
disorder prevailed in the administration. This was the
opportunity which made Shivaji’s rise to independent power -’
possible,

Shivaji could never for a moment be sure of the Delhi
Government's pacific disposition or fidelity to treaty proinises.
Hence, he lost no chance of robbing Mughal territory in the
Deccan. With Bijapur his relations were somewhat different,
He could raise his tiead or expand his dominion only at the
expense of Bijapur. But when, about 1662, an understanding
with him was effected by the Adil-Shahi ministers, he gave up
molesting the hearl of the Bijapur kingdom, With the Bijapuri
nobles whose fiefs lay close to his dominions and across the
path of his nalural expansion (29. Kolhapur, Kanara and
Kopal), he could not be af peace, though he did not wish
to challenge the central Government of Bijapur.

the South to wear out the last quarter century of his life in
ceaseless warfare, a period of 94 years iniervened, during
which there were five viceroys of the Mughal province of
Deccan, among whom Prince Shah Alam held the office for
11 years, Bahadur Khan for 6 years, Shaista Khan for 4,
Jai Singh for nearly two, and Dilir Khan for one year. Duting
these twenty-four years the Mughals pursued a vigorous forward
policy against Bijapur only under Jai Singh (1666), Bahadur
Khan (1676—77), and Dilir Khan (1679—80). Military operations
against the Marathas were actively carried on by Shaisla Khan
(1660—69), Jai Singh (1665), Mahabat Khan (1671—792) Bahadur
Khan ({673—75), and by Dilir Khan for a short while in 1678—
79. A state of war between Shivaji and the Mughals existed
for amuch longer period, but during most of it the imperial
generals acted languidly, so as to hoodwink their distant
master, while maintaining a secret understanding with shivagi /
(and, later, with Shambhuji) and accepting bribes from’
him. .

Only a few clear successes but no decisive result was
achieved by the Mughal arms in the Deccan during these
24 years, The cause of this failure was partly personal and
partly political. Shah Alam was a timid unenterprising prince,
inclined by nature to peace with his neighbours and the!
pleasures of the harem or the chase. Besides, his chief
lieutenant Dilir Khan’s open defiance of his authority often
made the viceregal camp in the Deccan as powerless as a
country torn by civil war. Shah Alam and Dilir always
worked at cross purposes and thus ensured Mughal failure
in the Deccan.

Secondly, the imperial officers were heartily sick of the
ceaseless war with Shivaji. The Hindu officers in Mughal pay
secretly fraternized with the Deccani champion of Hinduism,
while several of the Muslim generals were glad to bribe him
io let them live in peace. Above all, no Mughal governor

ot the Deccan was supplied with men and money even half
adequaie to the task of defeating Bijapur and the Marathas.
The rebellion of Prince Akbar and his flisht to Shambhuff
raised a danger to the throne of Delhi which could be met
only by Aurangzib’s personal appearance in the South, Thus
a complete change was forced on the imperial policy in that
quarter. The first task of Aurangzib now was to crush the
power of Shambhuji and render Akbar impotent for mischief.

83. Maharashtra : tfe land and tts people.

The home of the Maratha people is made up of three
clearly marked regional divisions. Between the Western Ghats
and the Indian Ocean lies a long narrow strip of land of
varying breadth, called Konkan (between Bombay and Goa)
and Kanara (south of Goa). It is an area of certain and
heavy tainfall—from 100 to 120 inches in the year,-~—with
tice for the predominant crop, and dense mango-groves,
plantain orchards and coconut-palms. Then, after crossing
the Ghals easiwards we have a belt of land, some 90 miles
in breadth, called Maral “Kt is extremely rugged, a series
of table-lands cut on every side by deep winding valleys,”

Going further towards the east, the spurs of the Western
Ghats sink, the river valleys widen out and form Desf or the
vast rolling blacl-soil plain of the Central Deccan.

This land, almost locked among the hills and open only in
the east, is the cradle of the Maratha kingdom. East of the
Ghats the rainfall decreases rapidly, and is tncertain and
insufficient for agriculture, while the soil is naturally sterile and
broken up by low ranges of bare rocky hill. “The Deccan,
generally speaking, yields to much labour a bare measure of
subsistence.”

In such a country, where Nature enforces a Spartan simpli-
city, there can be no luxury, no learned leisure (except among


--- Page 197 ---
190 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB , fou. X

the priests), no aesthetic development, no polished manners
even. But such a country and climate have their compensating
advantages. They develop self-reliance, courage, perseverance,
a stern simplicity, a rough straightforwardness, a sense of social
equality and consequently pride in the dignity of man as man.
In the 7th century, the Chinese pilgrim Yuan Chwang noted the
Marathas for being “proud-spirited and warlike, grateful for
favours and revengeful for wrongs.” In the course of the next
ten centuries they became more cunning and less chivalrous,
but the basis of their character remained the same,—activity,
self-reliance, self-respect and love of equality.

Social distinctions were fewer and much less sharp atmong
the i6th century Marathas than among richer and more civilized
communilies. The same sense of equality was fostered by
religion. Their popular saints of the 15th and 16th centuries
jaught the sanctity ef conduct rather than mere birth, and the
oneness of all true believers before God.

The simplicity and uniformity of early Maratha society were
also reflected in their language and literature, which were poor,
undeveloped, and essentially popular. Nature provided them ’
with many teady-made and easily defensible forts close al hand,
where they could “quickly flee for refuge and whence they
could offer a tenacious resistance. “The whole of the Ghats
often terminate towards the top in a wall of smooth rock, the
highest points of which, as well as detached portions on
isolated hills, form natural foriresses,.....Qwith) a level space on the
summit.....ln many of them there are springs of the finest water.”
Thus a remarkable community of language, creed and life
was alftained in Maharashtra in the 17th century, even before
political unity was conferred by Shivaji,

The backbone of Shivaji’s army was composed of the
peasaniry belonging to the Maratféa and Kunbi castes,-~a
simple, frank, independent, manly and hardy race. With the
Muslin conquest of the Deccan and the extinction of the last

CARELR OF SHA] BHONSLE . 191

Hindu kingdom in Maharashtra in the 14th century, the
fighting classes among the natives gathered round their own
leaders in small bands and hired out their swords to the
new rulers of the land. Many Maratha families rose to wealth,
power and distinction as captains of mercenary troops in the
service of the Muslim States in their neighbourhood.

$4. Shahi Bhonsle : his careet.

One such family, bearing the name of Bhonslé, originally
lived in the Palas sub-division of the Puna district, as the
headmen (pati) of two villages. They followed agriculture
and gained much local credit by their sober honest character
and religious benefaclions. Some buried treasure that they
discovered in their fields enabled them to buy arms and
horses and develop into captains of mercenaries under the
Nizam-Shahi dynasty at the close of the 16th century. Such
was Shahji Bhonsle, the eldest son of Maloji. Born in 1594,
he was married when a child fo Jija Bai, the daughter of
the high-born Lakhji Yadav Rao, baron of Sindhkhed and
one of the greatest Hindu nobles of Ahmadnagar.  Shahji
first saw service probably as the commander of the small
contingent of his family during the rule of Malik Ambar,
the regent of Nizam Shah. On the death of Malik Ambar
in May 1626, the Stale fell into rapid decay ; there were
frequent assassinations at Court. During these troubled times,
Shahji first followed the Nizam-Shahi Government, then
joined the Mughals, deserted them, fought against the
Bijapuris, went over to their side afterwards, and finally set
up a puppet Nizam Shah (1633) in one of the hill-forts of
the Sahyadri range. He seized all the Nizam-Shahi dominion
from Puna and Chakan to Balaghat and the neighbourhood
of Junnar, Ahmadnagar, Sangamner, Trimbak and Nasik,
and for three years (1633-36) carried on the government
in the Sultan's name. He made Junnar his capifal. But in

1636 a erand campaign was opened by the imperialists
against Shahji, in which he was completely defeated and had
fo give up eight of his forts, enter the service of Bijapur,
and leave Maharashtra.

§ 5. Childhood, education, and character of Shivaji.

Shivaji, the second son of Shahji and Jija Bai, was born
in the hillfort of Shivner, which overlooks the town of
Junnar, on 10th April 1627. After entering Bijapur service
towards the end of 1636, Shahjfi was sent away to the
Tungabhadra region and the Mysore plateau, and later on to
the Madras coast to conquer fresh territories for his new
master and jagirs for himself, But here his favourite wife
Tuka Bai and her son Vyankaji accompanied him, while Jija
Bai and Shivaji were sent to live at Puna, in charge of _ his
land-steward Dadaji Koncl-dev.

Her husband's neglect drove the mind of Jija Bai itwards
and deepened her natural religious spirit, which she imparted
to her son. Shivaji grew up in solitude, a mateless child,
without brother, sister or father. The isolation of their life
drew mother and son very close together and intensified his
love for her till if became almost an adoration for a deity.
From a very early age, he was thrown on his own resources,
and learnt io carry out his own ideas unaided and to take
the initiative without referring to any higher authortty. Such
education as he received was eminently practical; he became
skilled in fighting, riding and other manly accomplishments ;
but he mastered the contents of the great Hindu epics by
listening to recitations and story-tellings and thus learnt their
political lessons and moral * maxims. He loved to distraction
religious readings and songs (Kirtan) and sought the society
of Hindu and Muslim saints wherever he went

along the rugged forest-clad side and foot of the Sahyadri

range, were the homes of a sturdy, healthy, and brave race
of peasants called Maviles. From them Shivaji drew his earliest
comrades, his most devoted followers, and his best soldiers.
In the company of Mavle chieftains of his own age, young
Shivaji wandered over the hills and forests of the Sahyadri
range, and along the mazes of the river valleys, thus hardening
himself to a life of privation and strenuous exertion. A. stoical
earnestness mingled with religious fervour was very early
imparted to the character of Shivaji. He began to love
independence and loathe a life of servile luxury in the pay of
some Muslim king.

Dadaji Kond-dey died about the middle of 1647, and
Shivaji became his own master at the age of twenty, He
had already been trained in martial exercises and civil
administration ; he had familiarized himself with the troops of
his father’s western jagit, and the people he wotld have to
govern, Initiative and power of command had been

freely
developed in him.

8 6. Early conquests of Shivaji.

The year 1646 marks a crisis in the history of Bijapur.
The king fell seriously ill, and lingered on for ten years more,
but during these years no serious business could be attended
to by him. This was Shivaji’s opportunity, He occupied
Torna fort by tricking its Bijapuri commandant Here he
seized Government .treasure amounting to 2 fakhs of Auz.
Five miles east of it, on ihe crest of the same spur of hills, he
built a new fort named Rajgarh. Later he took Kondana
from a Bijapur agent. After the death of Dadaji, Shivaji
set himself to bring all parts of Shahjfi’s western jagir under
his own control, so as toform one compact State ruled by
one authority.

On 25th July 1648 Shahji was’ arrested and all his property

and contingent attached by the Bijapuri commander-in-chief,
Mustafa Khan, then investing Jinjiin the South Arcot district.

Shahji was broughtin chains to Bijapur, and kept under
guard until he submitted to his sovereign.

Shivaji was ina terrible dilemma: he appealed to Prince
Murad Bakhsh, the Mughal viceroy of the Deccan, entreating
him to secure the Emperor’s pardon for Shahji's past conduct
and protection for him and his sons in future, and offering
to come and join the Mughal service. Shah Jahan, however,
did not put any pressure on Adil Shah to release Shahji.
Shahji was set ai liberty, through the mediation of the
Bijapuri noble Ahmad Khan and in return for the surrender
of three fortis (Bangalore, Kondana and Kandarpi) to the
Sulian, (at the end of 1649). As the release of Shahi
had been conditional, Shivaji kept comparatively quiet during
the six gears from 1649 to 1655, instead of giving the Bijapur
Government any new provocation. His chief acquisition at
this time was the hillfort of Purandar, gained by treachery
to its Maratha Brahman owners.

At the extreme north-western corner of the Satara district
fies the village of Javli, which was then the centre of a fairly
large principality, including nearly the whole of that district,
owned by a Maratha family named More, the head of which
bore the heredifary title of Chandra Rao. They kept 12,000
infantry, mostly sturdy hillmen of the same class as
the Mavles.

The State of favli, by its situation, barred the path of
Shivaji’s ambition in the south and south-west. So he sent his
Brahman agent, Raghunath Ballal Korde to murder Chandra
Rao, during pretended negotiations for a marriage betwaen
Shivaji anc the late Chandra Rao’s daughter. Immediately on
hearing of the murder, Shivaji advanced and assaulled Javli
(i5 Jan. 1656), The leaderless garrison defended themselyes
for six hours and were then overcome. The whole kingdom

of Javli now passed into Shivaji’s possession. Two miles
west of Javlihe built a new fort named Pratapgarh, and here he
set up an image of his patron goddess Bhavani. In the April

following he captured Raigarh, his future capital, from the
Mores.

$7. Sfhivajr's first war with the Mughals, 1657.

On the death of Muhammad Adil Shah (4 Nov. 1656),
Aurangzib began active preparations for the invasion ot Bijapur,
and tried to seduce as many Adil-Shahi nobles and vassals
as he could. Shivaji’s envoy Sonaji reached the prince's
siege-camp before Bidar (in March 1657) and vwras assured that
the Mughal Government would grant all the prayers of the
Maratha chief, namely (/) a formal recognition of his right to
all the Bijapuri forts and villages actually in his possession
and (if) the annexation of the port of Dabhol and the territory
apperlaining fo it A reply in these terms was also written
to Shivaji by Aurangztb on 23rd April, 1657. But Shivaji
had already decided on the different policy of fighting for
his own hand. The vague promises of the Mughal prince
could not satisfy him. He considered it more profitable to
make a diversion in favour of Bijapur by raiding the south-
western corner of Mughal Deccan.

Two Maratha captains, Minaji Bhonsle at the head of
3,000 horse and Kashi, crossed the Bhima and plundered the
Mughal villages in the Chamargunda and Raisin sub-divisions
respectively. They carried devastation and alarm to the very
gates of Ahmadnagar, the chief city of Mughal Deccan, (end of
April 1657), A Maratha attempt to loot the city (eff) which
nestled under shelter of the fort of Ahmadnagar was defeated
by a timely sortie of the garrison. At the same time, Shivaji
was busy looting the Junnar sub-division in the north. In the
dark night of 30th April, he silently scaled the walls of Junnar

196 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cu. X

city with rope-ladders and after slaughtering the guards, carried
off 300,000 fun in cash, 200 horses, and much costly clothing
and jewellery, Aurangzib, on hearing of these disturbances,
poured reinforcements into the Ahmadnagar district. Nasiri
Khan, Iraj Khan, and some other officers at the head of
3,000 cavalry were ordered there. Meantime, Multafat Khan
fad issued from the fort of Ahmadnagar and relieved the
beleaguered outpost at Chamargunda by defeating Minaji,
(28th April.)

But when the Mughal pressure in the north Puna region
became great Shivaji slipped away to the Ahmadnagar district
and began to plunder it. By this time (end of May), however,
Nasiri Khan had reached the scene. By a forced march he
surprised Shivaji’s army and nearly encircled if. Many of the
Marathas were slain, many wounded, and the rest put to flight,
(4 June). Aurangzib ordered his officers to make reprisals
by entering Shivaji’s land from all sides, “wasting the villages,
slaying the people without pity, and plundering them to the
extreme.” His new dispositions for guarding his soulh-wesfern
frontier showed excellent combination and judgment The rains
now set in with the full violence of the monsoons, and the
campaign had to be suspended during June, July and August.

When in September his liege-lord, the king of Bijapur, made
peace, Shivaji found it useless and even rttinous to himself to
continue the war with the Mughal empire single-handed. He sent
his envoy Raghunath Pant to Aurangzib. The prince was just
then starting on his march to Northern India (25 Jan,, 1658)
and wrote to Shivaji in reply, “Though your offences do not
deserve pardon, I forgive you as you have repented.” But
Aurangzib’s mind was not really composed; he felt convinced
that the young Maratha chief was a raider whose daring was
only equalled by his cunning, and an ambitious adventurer who
would place self-interest above fidelity to his plighted word.

In the last quarter of the year 1657, the northward retreat

1659] AFZAL KHAN AGAINST SHIVAJI 197

of Prince Aurangzib, the likelihood of a civil war for the throne
of Delhi, and the wrangles among the Bijapuri nobles about
responsibility for their ill-success in the recent war with the
Mughals (vhich culminated in the murder of the waair Khan
Muhammad),—all combined to remove the only checks on_-
Shivaji’s ambition. Crossing the Western Ghats he burst into
Konkan. The northern part of this coast-strip formed the
Kalian (modern, Thana) district and was then governed by an
Arab named Mulla Ahmad of the Navaiyat (emigrant) clan, one
of the leading nobles of Bijapur. Shivaji easily seized the rich
towns of Kalian and Bhivandi (@4 Oct. 1657), which were then
without walls, and there took much wealth and costly mer-
chandise. The fort of Mahuli, which had once been the last
refuge of Shahji, was next captured (8 Jan. 1658). His progress
southwards into the Kolaba district seems to have been assisted
by the petty local chiefs who were eager to throw off Muslim
yoke and wrote inviting him to come. Kalian and Bhivandi
were immediately turned into naval bases and dockyards by
Shivaji.

, By the year 1659 he had extended his dominions in the
uplands or Des& to the southern limit of the Satara district, and
in North Konkan from Mahuli to near Mahad.

88. SAiraji slays Afzal Khan of Bijapur, 1659.

In 1659, the Bijapur Government being freed for the time
being from the constant menace of the Mughals on the frontier,
began to call iis refractory vassals to account The command
of the expedition against Shivaji was given to Abdullah Bhatari,
surnamed Afzal Khan, a noble of the first rank, who had fought
with conspicuous bravery and skill in the Karnalak expeditions
and the more recent war with the Mughals. But only 10,000
cavalry could be spared to accompany Afzal, while popular
report had raised the strength of Shivaji's Mavle infantry to
60,000 men. Afzal Khan was therefore instructed by the


--- Page 205 ---
198 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cn X

Dowager Queen to effect the capture or murder of Shivaji by
“pretending friendship” with him and offering to secure his
pardon from Adil Shah.* From his camp at Wai, Afzal sent
his land-steward Krishnaji Bhaskar to Shivaji with a very alluring
message, saying, “Your father has long been a great friend of
mine, and you are, therefore, no stranger to me. Come and
see me, and I shall use my influence to make Adil Shah
confirm your possession of Konkan and the forts you now
hold.”

Shivaji treated Afzal’s envoy, Krishnaji Bhaskar with respect,
and at night met him in secrecy and solemnly appealed to him
as a Hindu and a priest to tell him of the Khan’s real intentions.
ft was well known that when Afzal was besieging the fori of
Sera, he had put to death Kasturi Ranga, the Rajah of the
place, who had come to his camp to make his submission,
Krishnaji yielded so far as to hint that the Khan seemed to
harbour some plan of mischief. Shivaji then sent the envoy
back with Pantaji Gopinath, his own agent, who learnt from
Afzal’s officers by a liberal use of bribes that “the Khan had
sO atranged matters that Shivaji would be arrested at the inter-
view, as he was too cunning to be caught by open fight.”

The place chosen for the interview was the crest of an
eminence, below the fort of Pratapgarh, and overlooking the
valley of the Koyna, where a richly decorated tent had been
pitched for the purpose. On each side four men were present
within the tent-—~the principal, two armed retainers and an
envoy. But Shivaji was seemingly unarmed, like a rebel who
had come to surrender, while the Khan had his sword al his
side. But concealed in Shivaji’s left hand was a set of steel

* “Against Shivaji the Queen this year sent Abdullah Khan with an army ot
10,000 horse and fool, and because she knew with that strength he was not able to
resist Shivaji, she counselled him to pretend friendship with his enemy, which fe did.
And ihe other [/ 2, Shivaji], whether through intelligence or suspicion it is not known,
dissembled his love toward him &c.” (Revington at Rajapur to Company, 10 Dee.

claws (bagSnakh) fastened to the fingers by a pair of rings,
and up his right sleeve lay hidden a thin sharp dagger called
the scorpion (bichwwa).

The attendants stood below. Shivaji mounted the raised
platform and bowed to Afzal. The Khan rose from his seat,
advanced a few steps, and opened his arms to receive him
in his embrace. The short slim Maratha only came up to
the shoulders of his opponent. Suddenly Afzal tightened his
clasp, and held Shivaji’s neck in his left arm with an fron
grip, while with his right hand he drew his long straight-bladed
dagger and struck at the side of Shivaji. The hidden armour
‘beneath Shivaji’s coat rendered the blow harmless. He groaned
in agony as he felt himself being strangled. But in a moment
he recovered from the surprise, passed his left arm round the
Khan’s waist and tore his bowels open with a blow of the
steel claws, Then with the right hand he drove the
bichiwa into Afzal’s side. The wounded man relaxed his hold,
and Shivaji wrested himself free, jumped down from the
platform, and ran towards his own men outside,

The Khan cried out, “Treachery! Murder! Help ! Help (”
The attendants ran up from both sides. Sayyid Banda, an
expert swordsman attending on Afzal, faced Shivaji with his
tong straight sword and cut his turban in twain, making a
deep dint in the steel cap beneath. But Jiv Mahala hacked
off the tight arm of the Sayyid, and then killed him, Shambhufi
Kavi cut off Afzal’s head, which he carried in triumph to Shivaji.

Freed from danger, Shivaji and his two comrades then
made their way to the summit of Pratapgarh, and fired a
cannon. This was the signal for which his troops were
waiting in their ambush in the valleys below. At once the
armies of Moro Trimbale and Netaji Palkar and the thousands
of Mavles rushed on the Bijapuri camp from four sides,
Afzal’s officers and soldiers alike were panic-stricken at the
news of their chief's death and this unexpected attack in that

200 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cu X

unknown region, where every bush seemed to be alive with
enemies. The carnage in the Bijapuri army was terrible.

The booty taken was immense: all the artillery, waggons,
ammunition, treasure, tents and equipage, transport cattle and
baggage of an entire army, fell into the victors’ hands. Among
them were 65 elephants. 4,000 horses, 1200 camels, 2000
bundles of clothing, and {0 faffs of Rupees in cash and
jewellery.

Flushed with their victory over Afgal Khan (10 November,
1659) and the destruction of his army, the Marathas poured
into South Konkan and the Kolhapur district, capturing the fort
of Panhala, defeating another Bijapuri army, and making exten-
sive conquests (Dec. 1659—Feb., 1660).

§ 9. Shivaji besieged in Panfiala.

Early in 1660, Ali Adil Shah Il sent his Abyssinian slave
Siddi Jauhar (created Salabat Khan) with an army to put down
Shiva. fJauhar drove Shivaji into Panhala (Qnd Match, 1660),
which he invested with a force of 15,000 men. But Shivaji
corrupted Jauhar, so that the siege was conducted for mere show.
Fazl Khan, the son of the slain Afzal, however attacked the
Marathas with relentless vigour and by seizing a neighbouring
hillock threatened to make Panhala untenable. So, one dark
night (13th July) Shivaji slipped out of the fort with half his
forces, and though pursued by a Bijapuri army, made his
escape to Vishalgarh, 27 miles to the west. His success was
due to the desperate resistance of his rear-guard, under Baii
Prabhu (who was slain with most of his men) at the pass of
Gajpur. The men he had left in Panhala surrendered it on
22nd September.

§ 10. Sfaista KGan occupies Puna and Chakan,

Early in 1660, Shaista Khan, the new Mughal viceroy of
the Deccan, opened the campaign against Shivaji from the north,

1660] SHAISTA KHAN’S CAMPAIGNS IN DECCAN 201

after arranging for an attack upon the Maratha dominions by
the Bijapuris from the south at the same time Leaving
Ahmadnagar with a vast army on 25th February, the Khan
marched southwards along the eastern side of the Puna district,
methodically capturing and garrisoning all the strongholds
that guarded the approaches to Puna on the east and
south, The Marathas at first retreated before him without
risking a batile, till near Purandar. The Mughals were victorious
in fight and Shaista Khan entered Puna on 9h May.

Leaving Puna on 19th June, ihe Khan arrived in the vicinity
of Chakan (18 miles northwards) on the 4st, reconnoifred
the fort and began to run trenches towards the fort-walls,
After 54 days of hard labour a mine was carried from his
own position in the north to under the fower at the north-
eastern corner, and it was exploded at 3 p.m. on idth August,
1660. The work and its defenders were blown away; the
Mughals rushed to the assault, Next day the citadel capitulated.
But the imperialists had fo purchase their victory at a
heavy price, losing 9268 killed and 600 wounded.
Shaista Khan, on his return to Puna (end of August
1660) after the capture of Chakan, spent the rainy season
there in enforced inactivity. He employed his time more use-
fully in inducing Ghalib, the Bijapuri commandant of Parenda,
to surrender that fort to Aurangzib for a high price, (20th
November).

At the beginning of next year (1661), Shaisfa Khan turned
his attention to the Kalian district or North Konkan. Here a
small Mughal force, only 3,000 strong, under Ismail, had been
operating since April last, and had occupied a part of the
country, though the important cities and forts (like Kalian)
remained unconquered. In January 1661, a strong Mughal
force from Puna under Kar Talb Khan descended into Konkan.
At Umbarkhind (about 15 miles due east of Pen), Shivaji by
secret and rapid marches came up with them and cut off their


--- Page 209 ---
202 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cn X

lines of advance and retreat alike. Kar Talb’s army seemed
doomed to perish from thirst, without the power to move. In
despair he gave up all the property in his camp and paid a
large ransom to Shivaji and thus bought a safe retreat for his
army (3rd February, 1661). The Kalian district having been
thus freed from the new enemies, Shivaji left it alone, and
marched southwards, easily capturing city after city, till all the
coast-strip from Danda-Rajpuri to Kharepatan was commanded
by him. But these successes were chequered by a great defeat.
In May 1661 the"Mughals wrested Kalian from the Marathas and
Rept hold of it for nine years more. The net result of the
Operations of these two years was that the Mughals kept their
grip on the extreme north of Konkan, while Shivaji remained
master of the southern part, In March 1663, ithe Mughals gave
a long and vigorous chase to Netaji, the Master of the Horse
in Shivaji’s army. Netaji got away, though not without the loss
of 300 horse and himself wounded.

§ 11. Séivaji’s night-attack on Shaista Khan.

But within a month of meeling with this reverse to his
arms, Shivaji dealt a masterly blow at the Mughals. He sur-
prised and wounded the Mughal viceroy of the Deccan in the
heart of his camp, in his very bed-~chamber, within the inner ring
of his body-guards and slaves.

Shaista Khan was residing at Puna tn the Lal Mahal or the
unpretentious home of Shivafi’s childhood. His harem was with
him, and around his mansion lay the quarters of his guards
and attendants, the band-room and offices. Further off, across
the road leading southwards to Singh-garh lay the camp of his
lieutenant, Maharajah Jaswant Singh, and his contingent of
10,000 men. To surprise him here was an enterprise that
required no less agilty and cunning than bravery and dash.
Shivaji directed two supporting divisions of one thousand each,
under Netaji Palkar and Moro Pant the Pesfiwa, to take post


--- Page 210 ---
1663] SHIVA WOUNDS SIIAISTA KHAN 203

on the two flanks of the vast Mughal encampment, at a mile’s
distance from its outer side, After nightfall (Sunday, 5th April,
1663), with 400 picked men he himself entered the limits of
Puna, replying to the challenge of the Mughal guards that they
were Deccani soldiers of the imperial army going to take up
their appointed posts. After resting for a few hours in some
obscure corner of the camp, the party arrived near the Khan’s
quarters at midnight. Shivaji knew the ins and outs of the city
and every nook and corner of the house where he had passed
his boyhood and youth.

It was the sixth day of Ramzan, the month of fasting for
Muslims. The servants of the Nawab’s household had mostly
fallen asleep affer their day’s abstinence followed by the heavy
meal at night Some cooks who had risen from bed to make
a fire and prepare ihe meal which is taken a little before
dawn in the month of Ramazan, were despatched by
the Marathas without any noise. The wall dividing this outer
kitchen from the body-servants’ room within the harem once
had a small door in it, but the opening had been closed with
brick and mud to complete the seclusion of the harem. The
Marathas took the bricks out and made an opening there,
Shivaji, with his trusty lieutenant Chimnaji Bapuji, was the first
to enter the harem, and was followed by 200 of his men.
When he reached the bedroom of the Khan, the frightened
women roused the Nawab, but before he could use his
weapons Shivaji was tpon him and severed his thumb with
one stroke of his sword. It was evidently at this time that
the lamps in the room were put out by some wise woman.
In the darkness two of the Marathas tumbled into a cistern
of water; and the confusion that followed was used by
Shaista Khan's slave-girls to carry him away to a place of
safety. The Marathas continued their work of slaughter in
the darkness for some time.

Meantime the other half of Shivaji's force, (Q00 men), who


--- Page 211 ---
204, SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cu X

had been left outside the harem, had rushed the main guard,
slaying the sleepers and the awake and crying in derision,
“Is it thus that you keep watch?’ They next entered the
band-room and ordered the bandsmen, as if from the Khan,
fo play. The loud noise of the kettle-drums drowned all
voices, and the yells of the enemy swelled the confusion.

Abul Fath, a son of Shaista Khan, had been the first to
hasten to his father’s rescue wilhout waiting for others ; but
the brave youth was slain after he had struck down two or
three Marathas.

Shivaji, finding his enemies fully awakened and arming,
delayed no longer, but promptly left the harem, called his
men together, and withdrew from the camp by the direct
rotte, unmolested and wunpursued. During the surprise the
Marathas lost only six men killed and forty wounded, while
they slew a son and a captain of Shaista Khan, forty of his
attendants and six of his wives and = slave-girls, besides
wounding two other sons, eight other women and Shaista
Khan himself. The public throughout the Deccan ascribed
Shivaji’s exploit to the connivance of Jaswant Singh.

The daring and cunning of the Maratha hero were
rewarded by an immense increase of his prestige, He was
taken to be an incatnation of Satan; no place was believed
to be proof against his entrance and no feat impossible for
him. The Emperor heard of the disaster and ascribed it to
the viceroy’s negligence and incapacily. As a mark of his
displeasure, he transferred Shaista Khan to the government
of Bengal (1 Dec, 1663), which was then regarded as a penal
province. The Khan left the Deccan about the middle of
January 1664, on being relieved by Prince Muazzam.

812. SKivaji’s fest sack of Surat.

While this change of governors was going on at
Aurangabad, Shivaji performed a feat of even greater audacity


--- Page 212 ---
1664] PIRST SACK OF SURAT BY SHIVAII 205

than he had ever displayed before. From 6th to 10th January
he looted the city of Surat, the richest port of the Mughal
empire. It had, at that time, no wall to protect it Its wealth
was boundless. The imperial customs alone yielded a revenue
of 12 fax&s of Rupees a year.

The city of Surat covered nearly four square tiles,
including gardens and open spaces, and had a population
of 200,000 souls. The streets were narrow and crooked ;
but the town was mainly composed of poor men’s huts built
of wooden posts and bamboo walls and with floors plastered
with mud. “In the greater part of the town scarcely two oft
three brick-houses were to be seen in a street, and it some
parts,....not one for many streets together.”

Early in lhe morning of Tuesday, 3th January, 1664, Surat
was suddenly alarmed by the news that Shivaji had arrived
with an army af Gandavi, 28 miles southwards, and was
advancing [to plunder the town. At once the people were
seized with a panic, and began to flee away with their wives
and children, mostly across the river, to save their lives.
Rich men found shelter in the fort by bribing its commandant.
Inayet Khan, the governor of the town—who was quite
distincL from the commandant of the fort,—himself fled to
the fort, leaving the town at the ehemy’s mercy. He used
to draw from ihe Treasury the pay of 500 soldiers, but had
so long appropriated the money without maintaining a proper
force. His cowardice also prevenied him from organizing a defence
or even from dying at his post. The English and Dutch
merchants resolved to defend their own factories at all costs,
though these were open houses, not built to stand an attack.

At {1 o'clock in the morning of Wednesday, 6th January,
1664, Shivaji arrived at Surat and pitched his tent in a garden
a quarter of a mile outside the Burhanpur or eastern gate.
The Maratha horsemen immeédiately afterwards entered the
defenceless and almost deserted city, and after sacking the


--- Page 213 ---
906 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB {cu. XI

houses began to set fire to them. Throughout Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, this work of devastation was
continued, every day new fires being raised, so that thousands
of houses were consumed to ashes and iwo-thirds of the town
destroyed. Near the Dutch factory stood the grand mansion
of Baharji Borah, then “reputed the richest merchant in the
world,” his property having been estimated at 80 /akfs of
Rupees. The Marathas plundered it at leisure day and night
till Friday evening, when having ransacked it and dug up its
floor, they set fire to it, Close to the English factory were
the lofty residence and extensive warehouses of another very
rich merchant, Haji Said Beg, who, too, had fled away to the
fort, leaving his property without a defender. All the afternoon
and night of Wednesday and till past the noon of Thursday,
the Marathas continued to break open his doors and chesls and
eatry off as much money as they could. But in the afternoon
of Thursday the brigands left it in a hurry, on being scared
by a sortie which the English had made into the street. The
English merchants next day put a guard of their own in the
house of Said Bee and thus he suffered no further toss. The
plunder of Surat yielded above a £rore of rupees.

The cowardly governor Inayet Khan, who had run into the
fort on Tuesday night, formed an infamous plot from his safe
refuge. On Thursday he sent a young follower of his to
Shivaji with pretended terms of peace but really to murder
him at the interview. A Maratha body-guard that stood
before the Rajah with a drawn sword, struck off the assassin’s
hand with one blow. But so great was the force of the’
desperado’s rush that he did not stop but drove the bloody
stump of his arm on Shivaji’s person and the two rolled
on the ground together. At ten o'clock in the morning of
Sunday the 10th, Shivaji suddenly departed from Surat with
his army, on hearing that a Mughal force was coming to the
relief of the town,

1665] JAL SINGH’S CAREER AND CHARACTER 207

The Emperor showed his sympathy with the afflicted citizens
by excusing the custom duties for one year in the case of
all the merchants of Surat, and he rewarded the valour of the
English and the Dutch traders by granting them a reduction
of one per cent from the normal import duties on their
merchandise in future.

The year 1664 that lay between the departure of Shaista
Khan and the arrival of Jai Singh, was not marked by any
Mughal success. The new viceroy, Prince Muazzam, lived
al Aurangabad, caring only for pleasure and hunting.

8 13. jai Singh against Shivajt, Capture of Purandar.

The failure of Shaista Khan and the sack of Surat caused
bitter mortification to Aurangzib and his Court, and he decided
to send his ablest Hindu and Muhammadan generals, Jai Singt
and Dilir Khan, to put down Shivaji.

Jai Singh had fought under the imperial banner in every
part of the empire-——-from Balkh in Central Asia to Bijapur in
the Decean, from Qandahar in the west to Mungir in the east.
Hardly a year had passed during the long reign of Shah
Jahan when this Rajput chieftain had not seen active service
somewhete and received some promotion for conspicuous
merit. In diplomacy he had attained to a success surpassing
even his victories in the field. Wherever there was a difficult
ot delicate work to be done, the Emperor had only to turn to
Jai Singh. A man of infinite tact and patience, an adept in the
ceremonious courtesy of the Muslims, a master of Turki and
Persian, besides Urdu and the Rajput dialect, he was an ideal
leader of the composite army of Afghans and Turks, Rajputs
and Hindustanis, that followed the crescent banner of the
sovereign of Delhi, His foresight and political cunning, his
smoothness of tongue and cool calculating policy, were in
striking contrast with the impulsive generosity, reckless daring

blunt straightforwardness, and impolilic chivalry which we are
apt to associate with the Rajput character.

Jai Singh played skilfully upon the hopes and fears of the
Sultan of Bijapur, holding forth the chance of reduction of
tribute and removal of the Emperor’s displeasure, if Adil Shah
aided the Mughals and thus clearly proved his want of connec-
tion with Shivaji. He also arranged to combine against Shivaji
all his enemies and distract his attention by attacks from all
possible quarters. Money and promises of high rank in the
Mughal service were lavishly employed on Shivaji’s officers to
corrupt their loyalty, and with some success. Above all, Jai
Singh concentrated all authority in his own hands, as an
indispensable condition of success in war. He rightly’
insisted that in war there should be only one head, and that
the ‘man on the spo? should be given full authorily, or else
the work would suffer. The Emperor yielded to the argument
and Jai Singh gained absolute civil and military authority alike.

Jai Singh, with a true general’s eye for the ground, made
Saswad his base. Puna was strongly garrisoned. An outpost
was established opposite Lohgarh to observe and blockade if
and guard the road leading north to the Mughal frontier near
Junnar. A flying column was organized to vavage the Maratha
villages embosomed among the hills to the west and south-west
of Saswad. ,

On Slst March, Jai Singh look up a permanent base,
between Saswad and Purandar, only 4 miles from the later
place. Then he taid siege to the fort of Purandar.

Six miles south of Saswad rises the stupendous mountain
mass of Purandar, the highest point of which towers 4,564
feet above sea-level and more than 2,500 feet above the plain at
its foot. It is really a double fort, with an independent and very
strong sister enclosure, named Vajragarh, on a ridge running
out east of it Purandar consists of an upper fort or citadel with
precipitous sides all around, and a lower fort or machi, 300

fect of more below it. The latter is a ledge running round
the waist of the hill with many a winding, the entire circuit
being four miles. On the north side the ledge widens out
into a broad terrace, containing the barracks and offices of
the garrison. This terrace is bounded on the east by the high
spur named Bhairav Khind, which starts trom the base of the
steep overhanging north-eastern tower (called Kfad-kala or the
Sky-scraper) of the upper fort, and runs for about a mile
eastwards in a narrow ridge, ending in a small table-land
(3,618 feet above sea-level), crowned with the fort of
Rudramal (now called Vajragarh). This Vajragarh commands
the mach? or lower fort of Purandar on its northern and most
important face, as the garrison has to live here. Jai Singh,
like a true general, decided to attack Vajragarh first.

The incessant bombardment of the Mughals demolished the
bases of the tower in front of Vajragarh. At midnight, 13th
April, Dilir Khan’s division stormed the tower and drove the
enemy into ah enclosure behind it, Next day, the victorious
Mughals pushed on to the inner enclosure and the garrison,
oppressed by their fire, capitulated in the evening (14th April).

The possession of Vajragarh was the stepping-stone to the
capture of Purandar. Dilir Khan now turned to the fatter
fort, while Jai Singh organized taids into the Maratha country,
in order, as he wrote to the Emperor, to convince Shivaji
and the Sultan of Bijapur that the Mughal army was large
enough to be able to spare troops from the siege, and also
to prevent any concentration of forces round Shivaji by
creating constant terror and disturbance in various parts of
" his kingdom. There was also a secret reason for thus sending
away some generals from the siege-camp. He had some
disloyal officers under him, whose presence was worse than
useless. Daud Khan Qureshi was posted to watch the postern
gate (&Aick) of the fort; but after a few, days it became
known that a party of Marathas had eniered the fort by that

gate, without being opposed by him. “Subh-Karn Bundela did
not at all give his heart to the work, bul preferred above
everything else to favour Shiva 1”

The Maratha efforts to raise the siege were many, but on
the whole they failed to shake Jai Singh.

After the capture of Vajragarh Difir Khan advanced along
the connecting ridge and laid siege to the macfi or lower fort
of Purandar. His trenches approached the tower of Khad-
kala at the north-eastern angle of the fort.

When, in the course of May, the Mughal trenches reached
the foot of the two White Towers, which had been dismantled
by bombardment, the garrison began to throw down lighted
naphtha oil, leather bags full of gunpowder, bombs and heavy
stones which effectually stopped the further advance of the
Mughals. Jai Singh ordered a high wooden platlorm of logs
and planks to be made, on which guns were to be mounted
and parties of gunners and musketeers placed, to command
the enemy’s position, On 30th May, with only two hours of
daylight remaining, some Ruhela soldiers, without informing
Dilir Khan, stormed the White Tower. Afler an obstinate
struggle at close quarters, the Marathas lost heavily and retreat-
ed to behind the Black Tower, which they were forced to
evacuate aficr two days. Thus five towers and one slockade
of the lower fort fell into the hands of the Mughals. Purandar”
now seemed doomed.

Early in the siege, the gallant qiladar Murar Baji Prabhu,
with seven hundred selecl men had made a sortie on Dilir Khan,
who was trying to climb the hill with 5,000 Afghans and some
more troops of other races. Murar Baji with his Mavles slew
500 Pathans besides many Bafa infantrymen, and at the head
of sixty desperate followers cul his way to Dilir Khan. The
Khan, in admiration of his matchless courage, called upon
him fo yield and promised him his life and a high post
under him. Murar indignantly refused, and was going to

strike at Dilir when the fatter shot him down with an arrow.
Three hundred Mavles fell with him, and the rest retreated
to the fort.

The Mughal victorg of @nd June, and the impending fall
of the lower fort decided Shivaji. The families of the Maratha
officers were sheltered in Purandar, and its capture would
mean their captivity and dishonour. He resolved to interview
Jai Singh and make peace with the imperialists.

§ 14. Treaty of Purandar, (665.

On ith June at 9 o'clock in the morning, while Jai Singh
was holding court in his tent at the foot of Purandar, Shivaji
came to him and was welcomed with every honour.

Up to midnight the two sides higgled for the terms of a
permanent peace. “Gradually, after much discussion, we
came to this agreement —{a) That 95 of his forts,* the lands
of which yielded 4 lakfs of fun as annual revenue should be
annexed fo the Empire; and (6) that 12 of his forts, including
Rajgarh, wilh an annual revenue of | /atf of fun, should
be left to Shiva, on condition of service and loyally to. the
imperial throne” Shivaji, however, begged to be excused from
attending the Emperor’s Cotirt like other nobles and Rajahs,
and proposed to send his son, as his representalive, with a

. contingent of 5,000 horse, (to be paid by means of a
jagir), for regular attendance and service under the Emperor
or the Mughal governor of the Deccan.

In addition to the above terms, Shivaji made another and
a conditional engagement with the Mughals: “If lands

imperial farman that the possession of these lands will be
confirmed in me after the expected Mughal conquest of
Bijapur, then I agree to pay to the Emperor 40 /akfs of fun
in 13 yearly instalments.” He was expected to wrest these
lands from the Bijapuri officers by means of his own troops.
Here we detect lhe shrewdness of Jai Singh’s policy in throw-
ing a bone of perpetual contention between Shivaji and the
Sultan of Bijapur. Next day (12th June), according to the
agreement, 7,000 men and women, (of whom 4,000 were
combatants), left Purandar, and the Mughals entered into
possession of it; all the stores, weapons, artillery, and other
property found within were attached by the Government.
Mughal officers were sent with Shivaji’s men to take charge
of five other forts to be surrendered by the Marathas.

8 15, Shivaji visits Aurangzib at Agra, 1666.

Jai Singh at the end of the Bijapur campaign, had under-
taken {o send Shivaji to the imperial Court. He plied Shivaji
with hopes of high reward and “used a_ thousand
devices” to induce him to go fo Agra. In spite of these
temptations, Shivaji hesitated long. Both he and his
friends were as much alarmed al the idea of his
going to the Mughal Court as at the prospect of his
interview with Afsal Khan. But Jai Singh took the most solemn
oaths possible for a Hindu that Shivaji would not be harmed
duriag his visit Shivaji’s arrangements for the administration
of his kingdom during his expected absence in Northern India,
were a masterpiece of forethought and organization. His plan
was to make his local representatives absolutely independent
of any need for his orders or guidance during his absence,
His mother lija Bai was left as Regent. He began his journey
to Northern India on the 3th of March, 1666, with his eldest

son Shambhuji, seven trusty chief officers, and 4,000 troops.
On 9th May he arrived in the outskirts of Agra, where the
Emperor was then holding Court.

The 12th of the month was appointed as the day of his
audience. It was the 50th lunar birthday of the Emperor. The
Hall of Public Audience in Agra Fort was splendidly decorated
for the occasion. Into this Divan-i-am, Kumar Ram Singh
ushered Shivaji with his son Shambhuji and ten of his officers.
On behalf of the Maratha chief, 1,500 gold pieces were laid
before the Emperor as present (nazar) and Rs. 6,000 as offer-
ing (nisar), Aurangzib graciously cried out, “Come up, Shivafi
Rajah ! Shivaji was led to the foot of the throne and made
three salams. Then, ata signal from the Emperor, he was
conducted back to the place reserved for him among the
third-grade nobles, the work of the darbar proceeded, and
Shivaji seemed fo have been forgotten.

This was not the kind of reception he had so long been
picturing to himself and expecting as almost a cerlainty from
his many conversalions with Jai Singh. He learnt from Ram
Singh that he was among the commanders of 5,000, “What!”
he exclaimed, “my little son of seven years was created a °
5-hazari without haying had fo come to the Emperor’s presence.
My servant Netaji is a 5-hazari. And am |, after rendering all
these services and coming all the way fo the Court, to get the
same low rank ?” Then he asked, who the noble standing in
front of him was. Ram Singh replied that it was Mahatajah
Jaswant Singh. At this Shivaji cried out, “Jaswant, whose back
my soldiers have seen! I to stand behind him? What does
it mean ?” Stung to fury by what he considered a public
humiliation, Shivaji expostulated with Ram Singh in a high fone,
and even wanted to commit suicide rather than outlive such a
shame. Ram Singh tried his best fo pacify him, but in vain.
Swelling with suppressed anger and fretting within himself in
bitterness of mortification, Shivaji fell down in a swoon, There

O14 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB {cn X

was a stir among the courtiers. The Emperor asked what the
matter was. Ram Singh diplomatically replied, “The tiger is a
wild beast of the forest. He feels oppressed by heat in a place
like this and has been taken il” He also apologized for the
Rajah’s rade conduct by saying that he was a Deccani un-
familiar with Courts and polished manners. Aurangzib graciously
ordered the sick Rajah to be removed to an ante-room and
sprinkled with rose-water, and, on his cestoralion to his senses,
gave him leave to go to his quarters without waiting for the
close of the darbar.

On returning from the Court, Shivaji openly taxed the
Emperor with breach of fatih towards him, and asked to be
put to death as a lesser evil; it only increasecl the Emperor's
dislike and distrust of the Maratha chief. Ram Singh was
ordered to lodge him in the Jaipur House outside the city-walls,
and be responsible for his custody, Shivaji was forbidden the
Court, and he found himself a prisoner in fact. His appeals
fo the Emperor and the prime minister for release only met
with evasive replies, like “Wait a little and I shall do what you
ask for.” At the same time his position became worse than
before. Fulad Khan, the police chief of Agra, by imperial
order placed a iarge guard with artillery round Shivaji’s mansion
and he now became a prisoner in appearance as well as
in reality.

Jai Singh was placed in a dilemma by this unexpected
result of Shivaji’s visit to the Court He continued to write
to his Court agent, Ram Singh, to see to it that Shivaji’s life
was safe and the solemn assurances of the Rajput father and
s0n temained inviolate.

8 16. Sfhivaji's escape from Agra.

Shivaji turned to his own inner resources to effect his
liberation. He succeeded in getting permission for his Maratha
escort to return to the Deccan. Being thus freed from anxiety


--- Page 222 ---
{666] SHIVA] ESCAPES FROM AGRA 915

about his followers, Shivaji set about devising plans for his
own escape. He feigned illness and began to send out of his
house every evening sweetmeats for Brahmans, religious
mendicanls and courtiers. These were carried in huge baskets
slung from a pole which was borne by two men on their
shoulders. The guards searched the baskets for some days and
then allowed them to pass out unchallenged. This was the
opportunity for which Shivaji had been waiting. In the after-
noon of 19th August, he sent word fo his guards that he was
very ill and had taken to his bed and that they should not
disturb him. Tis half-brother Hiraji Farzand, who looked
somewhat like him, lay down on his cot, with a quilt covering
all his body except the outstretched right arm adorned with
Shivaji’s gold wristlet—while Shivaji and his son crouched
down in two baskets, which were safely sent out shortly after
sunset through the line of unsuspecting guards, being preceded
and followed by baskels of real sweets.

The baskets were deposited at a lonely spot outside the
city; the porters were dismissed ; and then Shivaji and his
son issued forth and made their way to a village six miles
from Agra, where the trusty Niraji Ravji (his Chief Justice) was
waiting for them with horses. After a hurried constitation in
a jungle the party divided; Shivaji with his son and three
oflicers, Niraji Raoji, Datta Trimbak and Raghu-mitra, a low
caste Maratha, smeared themselves with ashes like Hindu
ascelics, and hastened towards Mathura, while the others took
their own way homewards.

Meanwhile, at Agra, Hiraji fay in bed all that night and
well into the afternoon of the next day. The guards who
peeped in in the morning were satisfied when they saw Shivaji’s
gold bracelet on the sleeper’s wrist, and a servant sitting on
the floor massaging the patient’s feet. Aboul 3p“. Hiraji
quietly walked out of the house with the servant, warning the
sentries at the gale, “Make less noise ; Shivaji is il and under


--- Page 223 ---
216 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [on X

treatment.” Gradually the guards’ suspicion was aroused ; the
house seemed strangely deserted; no crowd of visitors came
fo see Shivaji as usual ; and there was no sound, no stir in
the house. They enlered his room and found that the bird
had flown away! They at once ran with the astounding news to
their chief Fulad Khan, who reported it to the Emperor,
ascribing Shivaji’s flight to witchcraft and saving himself from
all blame. But by this time Shivaji had had twenty-four hours’
clear start over his pursuers. The Emperor suspected that Shivaji
had fled with the connivance of Ram Singh. The Rajput
prince was punished, first by being forbidden the Court and
then by being deprived of his rank and pay.

With consummate cunning Shivaji threw his pursuers off
the scent, by following a route exactly opposite to that which
leads to Maharashtra. Instead of moving due south-west trom
Agra, through Malwa and Khandesh or Gujrat, he travelled
east-watds to Mathura, Allahabad, Benares, and Gaya, and
then south-westwards through Gondwana and  Golkonda.
After going through many romantic adventures and making
many hairbreacth escapes, Shivaji reached Rajgarh on 20th
November, 1666,

On returning home from Agra Shivaji found the political
situation in the Deccan entirely changed. The Mughal viceroy,
Jai Singh, was no longer in a position fo repeat his former
success over the Marathas. Worn out by age, toil, disappoint-
ment and domestic anxieties, discredited in his master’s eyes
by the failure of his invasion of Bijapur, Mitza Rajah Jai Singh
died at Burhanpur on @nd July 1667, after having been
relieved of the viceroyalty by Prince Muazzam in the
preceding May.

The return of the weak and indolent Muazzam and the
friendly Jaswant to power in the Deccan (May 1667) relieved
Shivaji of all fear from the Mughal side. It is true that
Dilir Khan returned to the side of Prince Muagzam in October

1667, but the coming of this famous warrior brought no
accession of strength to the imperialists. The prince was
jealous of Dilir’s influence and prestige at his father’s Court,
resented his insubordinate spiril, and regarded him as a spy
on behalf of the Emperor. The proud Ruhela general, on
his part, publicly slighted Maharajah Jaswant Singh, the
right-hand man and trusted confidant of the prince, so that
for some time to come a_ civil war raged in the Mughal
camp in the Deccan, and no step could be taken  ayainst
Shivaji, But even if the viceroy of the Deccan had been a
man of greater spirit and enterprise, it would have been
impossible for him for some years from this time to get
adequate men and money for an attempt to crush Shivaji.
The resources of the empire had to be concentrated elsewhere
to meet more pressing dangers: in March 1667, the Yusufzai
rising in Peshawar broke oul, which faxed the imperial strength
for more than a year afterwards.

The Maratha chief, on his part, was not eager for a war
with the imperialists. For three years after his return home
from Agra, he lived very quietly, and avoided giving any
fresh provocation to the Mughals. He wanted peace for a
fime to organize his government, repair and provision his
forts, and consolidate and extend his power on the western
coast ai the expense of Bijapur and the Siddis of Janjira. He
entreated Jaswant Singh to be his intermediary in making peace
with the empire. He wrote to the Maharajah, “Mirza Rajah, my
patron, is dead. if through your intercession I am pardoned, !
shall send Shambhu fo wait on the prince and serve as a
gnansabdar at the head of my followers wherever ordered.”

Jaswant Singh and Prince- Muazzam jumped at the offer
and recommended Shivaji to Aurangzib, who accepted the
proposal. The Emperor recognized Shivaji’s title of Rajah
(early in 1668), but did not restore any of his forts except
Chakan. Thus a peace was made which lasted for two years,


--- Page 225 ---
CHAPTER Xl
SHIVAJI, 1670-1680.

$1. S#ivaji’s rupture with the Mughals and
recovery of forts.

In terms of his new agreement with the Mughals, Shivaji
sent a Maratha contingent to Aurangabad under Pratap Rao
and Niraji Raoji (Aug. 1668). Shambhuji was created a
Commander of Five Thousand again and presented with an
elephant and a jewelled sword. Jagirs were assigned to him in
Berar. During 1667, 1668 and 1669, Shivaji remained very
quiet, as a vassal of the Mughal Government. His relations with
Bijapur also were pacific. In fact, during these three years
(1667-69), he was busy framing a set of very wise regulations,
which laid the foundations of his Government broad and deep.

But the peace was essentially a hollow truce on both sides.
Aurangzib, ever suspicious of his sons, looked upon Muazzam’s
friendship with Shivaji as a possible menace to his throne, and
he secretly planned to entrap Shivaji a second time, or at least
to seize his son and general as hostages. Another ill-judged
measure of imperial parsimony was lo attach a part of Shivaji’s
new jagirin Berar in order to recover the lakh of Rupees
advanced to him in 1666 for his journey to the Court. The
news of it reached Shivaji and he broke with the Mughals at
the end of the year 1669. ‘
we Shivaji opened his offensive with great vigour and immediate
success. His roving bands looted Mughal territory, and he
recovered several of the forts which he had ceded to
Aurangzib by the Treaty of DPurandar. His most conspicuous
success was the capture of Kondana from Udai-bhan, its

Rajput qiladar, (4th Feb. 1670). Assisted by some Koli
guides who knew the place well, one dark night Tanaji
Malusare, with 300 picked Mavle infantrymen, scaled the
less abrupt hill-side near the Kalian gate by means of rope-
ladders. The garrison fought desperately, but the Mavles
with their war cry of Hara ! Hara! Mafader ! carried havoc
into their ranks. The two chiefs challenged each other and
both fell down dead, after a single combat. Twelve hundred
Rajputs were slain, and many others perished in trying to
escape down ihe hill-side. Shivaji named the fort Singh-gac6
after the lion-heart that had won it.

Ludi Khan, the fawfdar of Konkan, was wounded in a
battle with the Maratha forces, defeated in a second encounter
and expelled from his district, The Mughal faujdar of Nander
fled away, deserting his post. The only officer who made
an attempt to uphold the imperial prestige in the Deccan
was Daud Khan Qureshi, who successfully held Parnir and
Junnar.

By the end of April 1670 Shivaji had looted 51 villages
near Abmadnagar, Junnar and Parenda.

§ 2 Quarrel between Muazzam and Diltv.

The Mughal administration of the Deccan was during
half of the year 1670 passing through a civil war between
the viceroy Shah Alam and his general Dilir Khan. The latter
refused fo wait on the prtinee, fearing that he might be
treacherously killed or imprisoned by his chief! At this act
of insubordination, the prince and his favourite lieutenant
Jaswant wrote to the Emperor accusing Dilir Khan of rebellion.
The Khan had already denounced the prince to the Emperor,
saving that he was in collusion with Shivaji. Aurangzib was
at this time filled with setious anxiety at Muazzam’s wilful
conduct, neglect of the imperial busiriess, and failure to carry


--- Page 227 ---
220 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB {cu. XI

out orders. Dopular voice in the Decean could account for
the open audacity and easy success of Shivaji’s raids and
the prince's inactivity, only by ascribing to Muazzam a
treasonable design to attempt his father’s throne in alliance
with the Marathas.

So, at the end of March 1670 the Emperor had sent his
Chamberlain (Xfan-i-saman), Vitiehar Khan, to Aurangabad
to investigate how matters really stood,—whether Muazzam
was really bent on treason and what his relations with
Shivaji were. This officer was now instructed to inquire into
the prince's charges against Dilir Khan.

Dilir, finding his position in the Deccan intolerable, wanted
to go back to the iniperial Court without waiting for Shah
Alam's permission; but the prince ascribed this course to a
wicked desire of creating disorder in Northern India. Imperial
orders reached him to force Dilic Khan back to the path of
obedience. Though it was the height of the rainy season
(August), the rivers swollen and the roads miry, Dilir burnt his
tents and stores and fled northwards to Ujjain with his army.
As soon as he started from the south, Prince Muazzam and
Jaswant gave him chase with all the available Mughal troops.
But on the frontier of Khandesh a letiler came from the
Emperor ordering Muazzam back to Aurangabad (September).
For, in the meantime, Bahadur Khan, the governor of Gujrat,
had taken Dilir Khan under his protection and written lo the
Emperor praising Dilir’s loyally and past services, and
recommending that Dilir might be permitted to serve under
him as faujdar of Kathiawad. The Emperor agreed. Muazzam
promptly obeyed his father’s order and returned to Aurangabad
at the end of September, 1670, ,

These internal troubles paralysed the Mughal arms, and
Shivaji made the most of this golden opportunity. In March
the English factors at Surat wrote, “Shivaji. marches now not
as before as a thief, but in gross with an army of 30,000

1670] SECOND PLUNDER OF SURAT? 921

men conquering as he goes, and is not disturbed though the
prince (Shah Alam) lies near him.” On 3rd October he
plundered Surat for the second time.

83. Second loot of Surat.

On 2nd October came successive reports of Shivafi's
arrival wilh 15,000 horse and foot within 20 miles of Sutat.
All the Indian merchants of the city, and even the officers of
Government had fled away in the course of the preceding
day and night) On the 3rd, Shivaji attacked the city, which
had recently been walled round by order of Aurangzib. After
a slight resistance the defenders fled to the fort, and the
Maralhas possessed themselves of the whole town except only
the English, Dutch and French factories, the large New Sera
of the Persian and Turkish merchants, and the Tartar Serai
midway between the English and French houses, which was
occupied by Abdullah Khan, ex~king of Kashghar, just returned
from a pilerimage to Mecca. The French bought off the
raiders by means of “valuable presents.” The English factory,
though it was an open house, was defended by Streynsham
Master with 50 sailors.

The Tartars made a stout resistance al] the day, but finding
the post untenable they fled with their king to the fort at
night, giving up to plunder their house with its valuable pro-
perty. The Turks in the New derai successfully defended
themselves, inflicting some loss on the raiders. The Marathas
plundered the large houses of the cily at leisure, and burnt
down nearly half the town, retreating on the Sth.

An official inquiry ascertained that Shivaji had carried off
66 lakhs of Rupees’ worth of booty from Surat But the
real loss of Surat was not to be eslimated by the plunder
which the Maralhas carried off. The trade of this, the tichest
port of India, was practically destroyed. For several years

after Shivafi’s withdrawal from it the town used to throb
with panic every now and then, whenever any Maratha force
came within a few days’ march of it, or even at false alarms
of their coming. On every such occasion the merchants
would quickly remove their goods to ships, the citizens would
flee to the villages, and the Curopeans would hasten to Swally,
Business was effectually scared away from Surat.

8 4. Shivaji defeats Daud Khan al Dindori, 17tf8 October
1670; raids Becat.

After this second sack of Surat, Shivaji entered Baglana
and plundered the villages al lhe foot of Mulhir fort. Daud
Khan, who had been called away from Burhanpur to go
against the Maratha raiders, reached the town of Chandor,
where the road from Baglana to Nasik crosses the hill range.
At the midnight following i6th October, bis spies reported
that Shivaji hac already issued from the pass and was rapidly
following the road to Nasi with half his forces, while the other
half of his army was holding the pass to pick up stragglers,
Daud Khan at once resumed his march. Ikhlas Khan Miana,
leading the Mughal vanguard, sighted the enemy in the early
morning, and without waiting for his lroops to come up,
recklessly charged the enemy, The Maratha rear-guard,
which had faced about, was 10,000 strong and commanded
by distinguished generals like Pratap Rao Gujar, the Master
of the Horse, Vyankafi Datto, and Makaji Anand Pao (a
natural son of Shahji Bhonsle). Ikhlas Khan was very soon
wounded and unhorsed. After a time Daud artived and
reinforced his van. For hours together an obstinate and
bloody battle raged. The Matathas, “like the Bargis of the
Deeean, fought hovering round the imperialists.” But the
Bundela infantry of the Mughal army with their abundant
fire-arms kept the enemy back. There was a lull in the fight

at noon. In the evening the Marathas charged again, but .
were driven back, evidently by the artillery. At night the
Mughals bivouacked under the autumn sky, their camp was
entrenched, and they engaged. in burying the dead. and
fending the wounded. The Marathas: retreated fo [Konkan
without further opposition. About a week later the Peshwa
captured the fort of Trimbak’ (Nasik district), This battle
neutralized the Mughal power for more than a month
afterwards. The day after the fight, Daud Khan marched
with the broken remnant of his army to Nasik, and halted
there for one month, evidently to recoup his strength. Late
in November, he removed to Ahmadnagar. Early in December

Shivaji had invested Salhir with a force of 90,000 horse
and foot, and one day finding the garrison off their guard he
scaled the wall by means of rope-ladders. The gqiladar
Fathullah Khan fell fighting, and his wife's brother then gave
up the fort to the enemy (c Sth Jan. 1671). The success of the
Marathas continued. Their roving bands cut off the grain
supply of Neknam Khan, the faujdar of Baglana. ,

845. Campaigns of Mughal generals, 1671-72.

These reverses roused Aurangzib to a sense of the yravily
of the situation. He appointed Mahabat Khan to the supreme
command in the Deccan. Reinforcements in men, money and
provisions were poured into Baglana Jan. 1671).

Late in January 1671, Mahabat Khan joined Daud Khan
near Chandor and the two laid siege to Ahivant, which Shivaji
had recently taken. After a month the garrison capitulated.
Leaving a force to hold Ahivant, Mahabat spent three months
at Nasile and then went to Parnir (20 miles west of Ahmad-
nagar) to pass the raing season (June to September) there.

The Emperor was dissatisfied wilh Mahabat Khan for the
poor result of his campaign and his long spell of inactivity
aflerwards, and suspected him of having formed a secret
understanding with Shivaji. So, he sent Bahadur Khan and
Dilir Khan to the Deccan next winter. They marched from
Gujrat into Baglana, laid siege to Salhir (now in Maratha
hands), and leaving Ikhlas Khan Miana, Rao Aimar Singh
Chandawat and some other officers to continue the siege,
proceeded towards Ahmadnagar. Dilir Khan with a flying
column recovered Puna, massacring all {he inhabitants above
the age of 9 years, (end of December 1671). But the
division left to besiege Salhir was attacked by a large force
of Marathas under Pratap Rao, Anand Rao and the Peshwa.
After an obstinate battle, Ikhilas Khan and Muhakam Singh


--- Page 232 ---
1672] MARATHA VICTORIES IN BAGLANA AND KOLVAN 905

{the son of Rao Amar Singh Chandawat) were wounded
and captured, with 30 of their principal officers, while Rao
Amar Singh and many other commanders as well as several
thousand common soldiers were slain, and the entire sicge-
cainp was taken by the enemy. Shortly aflerwards Moro
Pant captured Mulhir. This took place at the end of January
and the first weck of Webruary, 1672. Shivaji's prestige and
confidence in his own power were immensely increased by
these successes.

About the middle of 1672, Mahabal and Shah Alam were
recalled to Hindustan, and Bahadur Khan was appointed
commander-in-chief and acting viceroy of the Deccan, in the
place of these two, becoming substantive subafdar in January
{673 and holding that office itll August 1677,

8 6, Maratha occupation of the Koli country and
deatand of chauth fram Surat, 1672.

On 43th June, a large Maratha army under Moro Trimbak
Pingle captured Jawhar from its Koli Rajah, Vikram Shah,
and seized there treasure amounting to 17 /akfAs of Rupees.
Advancing further north, he took the ‘other Koli State of
Ramnagar in the first weele of July.

The annexation of Jawhar and Ramnagar gave the
Marathas a short, safe and easy rote from Kalian up
Northern Konkan to Surat, and faid that port helplessly open
to invasion from the south. The city became subject to
chronic alarm from the Marathas.

From the neighbourhood of Ramnagar, Moro Trimbak
Pingle sent three successive fetters on behalf of his master
to the gowernor and leading traders of Surat demanding
four da&4s of Rupees as blackmail, and threatening a visit to
the city in the event of their refusal.

From their base in the Koli country, a Maratha force under
Moro Trimbak easily crossed the Western Ghats info the Nasilz

district (middle of July 1672) and plundered it, defeating Jaday
Rao and Siddi Halal, the Mughal ‘fanafdars in charge of the
southern and norihern sub-divisions of the district. For this
failure, these two officers were sharply censured by Bahadur
Khan and they went over to the Marathas in anger !

8 7. Maratha activities during 1675.

In November next Shivaji sent his cavalry to make a
lightning raid into Berar and Telingana. The Mughal general
was baffled in his attempt to come up with them. The Marathas
from Ramgir divided into two bodies, one escaping south into
the Golkonda State andthe other turning northwards to Chanda
and thence westwards info Berar. The first division was
headed off into Bijapur territory by Dilir Khan who captured
much of their booty. The second band was opposed by
Bahadur Khan near Antur (38 mifes north of Aurangabad) and
much plunder was recovered ftom them and restored to the
owners. Another batlle was fought six miles from Aurangabad,
in which the Marathas were repulsed, with a loss of 400 dead,
by the Bundelas under Subh-Karn (Dec).

This Maratha raid info Khandesh and Berar, untike their
first incursion in December 1670, was completely foiled by the
commendable activity of the Mughals,

In 1673 Bahadur Khan encamped at Pedgaon, on the north
bank of the Bhima, eight miles due south of Chamargunda.
This place became the residence of his army for many years
afterwards, and here a fort and town grew up from their
cantonment, which the Emperor permitted him to name
Bahadur-garh.

Pedgaon occupies a position of great strategic importance,
It stands on the plain just clear of the long mounlain spur
running eastwards from Puna. From this place the Mughal
general could at will move westwards along the north of the
range to protect the valleys of the Mula and the Bhima (the


--- Page 234 ---
1673] SHIVAI'S GAINS FROM BIAPUR 297

North Puna district), or along the south of it to guard the
valleys of the Nira and the Baramati (the southern portion of
the district). Northwards he could communicate with his great
depot of arms and provisions at Ahmadnagar, without having
fo cross any river (except at the foot of that fort); and south-
wards he could easily invade Bijapur through the Sholapur
clistrict.

This year Shivaji’s attempt to gain Shivner (the fort of
Junnar) by bribery was foiled by Abdul Aziz Khan, the Mughal
governor of the fort, who was a Brahman convert to Islam
and one of the most faithful and valued servants of Aurangzib.
He received Shivaji’s bribe, but at the same time secretly
informed Bahadur Khan of the plot; the Maratha army fell into
an ambuscade planned | by the Mughals, and retired in dis.
appointment with heavy loss.

Ali Adif Shah fF died on 24th Nov., 1672, and in a few
months the government of Bijapur (with a boy of four on the
throne) fell into disorder and weakness. This was Shivaji’s
opportunity. On 6th March 1673, he got possession of Panhala
a second time, by bribery, and on 27th July he secured the
hitl-forl of Satara by the same means. In May his men under
Pratap Rao Gujar burst into the inland parts of Bijapuri Kanara,
looting Hubli and many other rich cities. But they received a
great check from the Bijapuri general Bahlol Khan.

On Dasafaca day (10th Oct 1673), an army 25,000 strong,
led by Shivaji in person, burst into Bijapuri ferrifory, plundering
meny tich towns, and then passed into Kanara for more
plunder. Here they tcemained busy till the middle of
December,

Late in January 1674, a Mughal army tried to descend
into Konkan and cause a diversion in that quarter
simultaneously with the Bijapuri invasion of the Panhala
region. But Shivaji stopped the paths by breaking the roads
and mountain passes and keeping a constant guard at various



--- Page 235 ---
928 SHORT [HISTORY OF AURANGZIB lcm. XI

points where the roule was most difficult ; and the Mughals
had to return baffled,

Soon afterwards, the Mughal power in the Deccan
was crippled. The rising of the Khaibar Afghans became
so serious that Aurangsib had to leave Delhi (7th April) for
Hasan Abdal, in order to direct the war from the rear, and
next month Dilir Khan was called to the north-western frontier.
Bahadur Khan was left alone in the Deccan with a greatly
weakened force, This lull in the war was utilized by Shivaji
to crown himself with the greatest pomp and ceremony, on
6th June, 1674, at Raigarh.

§ 8. Loot of Bafadur KBan’s camp and extensive contest with
the Mughals, 1674.

The coronation exhausted Shivaji’s treasury and he was in
need of money to pay his troops. Towards the middle of
July, a body of 2,000 Maratha light cavalry, made a false
demonstration and lured Bahadur Khan some 50 iniles away
from his cantonmenis at Pedgaon, when Shivaji himself with
another division, 7,000 strong, swooped down by another
route on his defenceless camp, carried away a Krore of
Rupees in booty and 900 fine horses, Late in October, a
large army commanded by Shivaji in person crossed the
Ghats into the Deccan plateau, skirted Bahadur Khan's
camp, which was “hotly afatmed,” looted several towns near
Aurangabad, and then burst into Baglana and Khandesh,
where they continued for more than a month (Nov. to
middle of Dec.). Among other places they pillaged and burnt
Dharangaon, 10 miles north of Erandol, and its English factory.

Shivaji next opened delusive peace negotiations with
Bahadur Khan, and for nearly three months (Marech—May)
kept the Mughals in play, by feeding false hopes of a peace.
But by the time (July 1675) that Phonda was captured,

Shivaji threw off ihe mask and dismissed the Mughal envoys
with taunts. 7

In January 1676 Shivaji was taken severely ill, and passed the
next three months on the sick-bed at Satara. The civil war
that had broken out between the Deceani and Afghan patties
al Bijapur on the usurpation of the regency by Bahlol Khan
fend of 1675) was Shivaji’s opportunity. “He ranged up and
down, plundered and robbed without any hindrance or
danger.” On 3ist May Bahadur Khan opened a_ vigorous
and long campaign against Bijapur, the consequence of which
was to drive the new regent Bahloi Khan into the arms of
Shivaji.

89. Sflpaji’s diplomatic preparations for fis Katnatak

expedition.

In January next (1677), the Maratha king set ott on the
greatest expedition of his life, the invasion of the Karnatak.
The political situation in the neighbouring’ countries was
eminently favourable to Shivaji’s design. The Emperor’s best
troops were still engaged in controlling the revolied hillmen of
the Afghan frontier. At Bijapur the Mughal viceroy openly
took the side of the Deccani party and on 31st May opened
a campaign against Bijapur which was to continue for
more than a year. Shivaji’s clever diplomacy won a
complete triumph over Bahadur Khan, who had already
coquelted with the Maratha king for a friendlly understanding,
And now, on the eve of opening the Mughal campaign
against Bijapur, (May, 1676), it was as much his interest to
make friends with the Marathas on his right flank as it was
Shivaji’s to secure Mughal neutrality in his rear during his
invasion of the Karnatak. Shivaji sent his Chief Justice, Niraji
Raoji, to Bahadur Khan, with costly presents and induced him
to promise neutrality during his projected absence in the
Karnalak, the conquest of which was expected lo take one year.


--- Page 237 ---
930 SHORT HISfORY OF AURANGZIB [er Xl

With Golkonda close friendship and co-operation were
secured. Madanna Pandit, the all-powerful wazir of Abul Hasan
Qutb Shah, had already made a subsidiary alliance with
Shivaji, promising him an annual tribute of one fakA of Aun
for the defence of the realm. Prahlacl Niraji, a shrewd
diplomatist, had been posted at Haidarabad as Maraiha envoy.
Shivaji decided to get from Gollzonda the expenses of the
campaign and the assistance of an auxiliary force, by promising
to Qutb Shah a share of his conquests.

8 10. S#ivasi’s alliance with Golkonda and conquest of the
Katnatak.

Shivaji started from Raigarh at the beginning of January
1677, and advanced due east by regular marches, at the head
of 50,000 armed men, arriving at Haidarabad early in February.
On entering the Qutb-Shahi territory he had issued strict
orders to his men not to rob or molest any inhabitant of the
country, and had enforced obedience by severe punishment.

The city of Haidarabad was gaily decorated by the people
to give a royal welcome to the great friend and protector of
their king. The Maratha army marched through the streets in
perfect order and halted before the Dad Mahal palace, while
Shivaji with five of his officers went upstairs and had a friendly
conversation with the Sultan for three hours. Abul Hasan,
being very favourably impressed by Shivaji’s personal charm,
character and ability, and the strengih and discipline of his
army, bade his wazir grant him whatever he wanted. Alter
some discussion a secret compact was made regarding the
coming campaign. The Sullan wasto pay Shivaji a subsidy of
3,000 Aun a day, or four and a half faé4s of Rupees a month,
and send an army of 5,000 men in charge of one of his
generals (sar~i~lashfar), Mirza Muhammad Amin, to co-operate
in the conquest of the Karnatak. In return for this aid,
Shivaji promised his ally such parts of his conquests in the

1677} SHIVAJE CONQUERS MADRAS KARNATAK O31

Karnatak as had not belonged to his father Shahji. The
defensive alliance against the Mughals was strengthened anew
with solemn oaths. Qutb Shah promised to pay his annual
subsidy of one /aéf of fun regularly and to keep a Maratha
ambassador at his Court, as the price of his protection against
the Mughals.

The dominions of the vassals of the fallen Vijaynagar
empire had been mostly seizect by Adi! Shah and Qutb Shah.
Bijapur now possessed fnorthern and eastern Mysore and the
Madras plain (or Karnatak lowlands) from the Palar river
southwards to the Kolerun (branch of the Kaveri), 7 e, the
country from Vellore to near Tanjore, while Golkonda had
annexed the region north of the Palar, namely from Chicacole
to Sadras. In the Karnatak plain the local governors of
Bijapur were Nasir Muhammad Khan (a son of the ex-wazir
Khan Muhammad) with his seat at Jinji, and south of him
Sher Khan Lodi (an Afghan protege of Bahlol Khan) with his
capital at Vali-kanda-puram (in the north of the Trichinopoly
district), Further south were the Hindu kingdoms of Tanjore
(conquered by Shivaji’s half-brother Vyankafi in 1675) and
Madura, All these powers were ever bent on fighting with
and arnexing one another's territories. Taking advantage of
these infernal dissensions, the Qutb-Shahi minister Madanna
planned to reconquer Bijapuri Karnatak with the help of
Shivaji ancl restore Hindu rule there.

Leaving Haidarabad after a month, Shivaji hastened south-
wards by way of Karnul, Shri Shailam, Anantpur, Tirupati,
Kalahastri and Peddapolam (seven miles west of Madras, first
week of May). He then took the strong fort of Jinji by treaty
with its owner and laid siege to Vellore, whose governor
ultimately yielded it fora price after a heroic defence of fourteen
months, on 21 Aug. 1678.

The flood of Maratha invasion swept over the Karnatak
plains. Only a few fortified places offered resistance, the rich


--- Page 239 ---
O39 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cn XI

men fleeing to the shelter of the woods or the European forts
on the coast at the news of their approach. Sher [han Lodi
was defeated at Tiruvadi (13 miles west of Cuddalore) on 26th
June and forced to give up all his territories. Then marching
io Tirumala-vadi, on the north bank of the Kolerun river,
Shivaji. invited Vyankaji to meet him and tried to wrest from
him three-fourths of what their father had left at his death.
But Vyankaji cleverly escaped (3rd July) to Tanjore, and
Shivaji set out on his return, visiting many holy places on the
way. The whole of the Karnatak was “peeled to the bones”
by his system of organized plunder and exaction.

The territory annexed by Shivaji in the Karnatak in the
course of 1677 and 1678 was sixty leagues by forty and
estimated to yield 20 lakhs of fun a year, and it included a
hundred forts.

Shivaji left the Madras plains early in November 1677 and
entered the Mysore plateau, conquering ifs eastern and central
parts. From Sera in the heart of the Mysore kingdom, he
marched home by way of Kopal, Gadag, Bankapur, Belvadi
(in the Belgaum district) and Turgal, and returned to his own
stronghold of Panhala in the first week of April, 1678.

8 11. The Mugfats, Bijapur, and Shivaji, 1678-79.

In May 1678 the Marathas made a second attempt to get
possession of Shivner. They invested the village (of Junnar)
at its foot, and at night tried to scale the fort. “Three
hundred Marathas climbed the fort-walls at night by means
of nooses and rope-laddetrs. But Abdul Aziz Khan was an
expert qifadar; he slew all the infantry of Shivaji who had
entered the fort, and sent a message to Shivaji to the effect,
‘So long as I am qiladar, you will never take this fort’

A rupture now took place between Shivaji and Qutb
Shah, and the diplomatic system so patiently built up by
Madanna Pandit fell to the ground. Qutb Shah’s indignation


--- Page 240 ---
1679] CONFUSED STATE-RELATIONS IN DECCAN 035

had been rising as he found himself made a mere cat's paw
of Shivaji in the Karnatak adventure. He had borne all the
expenses of the expedition and supplied artillery and an
auxiliary force for it But not one of the conquered forts
was given to him, not one pice of his contribution was repaid
out of the fabulous booty carried away by Shivaji from that
Jand of gold. So, Abul Hasan arranged for a peace between
the new Bijapuri regent, Siddi Masaud, and his rivals
(especially Sharza Khan), helped him with money to pacify
the unpaid mulinous soldiery, and bound him to wage war
against Shivaji and “confine him to Konkan.” But Dilir Khan
spoiled the whole plan by an atlack on Bijapur.

Shivaji's eldest son Shambhuji was the curse of his old age.
This youth of twenty-one was violent, capricious, unsteady,
thoughtless and noloriously depraved in his morals, For his
outrage on a matried Brahman woman he had been confined
in Panhala fort, but escaped with his wife Yesu Bai and a
few comrades to join Dilir Khan (13 Dec. 1678). The Khan
with his valuable new ally halted at Akluj (50 miles south
of Bahadurgarh) for some time to prepare for the invasion
of Bijapur.

In this danger Siddi Masaud immediately asked for help
from Shivaji, as agreed upon. The Rajah sent six fo seven
thousand well-armed cavalry to guard Bijapur. Masaud
could not fully trust his ally, Then Shivaji threw off the
mask, He began to plunder and devastate Adil-Shahi territory
again. Masaud now made peace with Dilir Khan. A Mughal
force was invited to Bijapur and royally welcomed.

Dilie Khan next matched to the fort of Bhupalgarh,
(20 miles n. w. of Jath and 45 miles s, w. of Pandharput),
which Shivaji had built as a storchouse of his property and
the refuge of the families of his subjects in the neighbourhood
during his wars with the Mughals. The assault was launched
‘about 9AM, Qnd April, 1679, and the Mughals fought

934, SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIL [cu. Xt

with vigour till noon, when they captured the fort, alter
heavy slaughter on both sides. Vast quantities 1of grain and
other property and large numbers of .people were captured
by the victors. Seven hundred survivors of the garrison were
deprived of one hand and then set free; the other captives
were evidently sold into slavery. The fall of Bhupalgarh
was followed by a period of puzzling intrigue and counter-
intrigue between the Mughal viceroy and the Bijapur nobility,
and also quarrels between Masaud and Sharza Khan,
Masaud and Dilir, and Masaud and his favourite Venkatadri
Murari. About the middle of this year Shivaji sent to
Aurangzib a well-reasoned and spirited letter of protest
against the jagiya, which was drafted by Nila Prabhu in
eloquent Persian. (Hist. of Aurangaib, tii. ch. 54 Appendix.)

§ 19. Last campaign of Séivajt.

On 18th August, Dilir crossed the Bhima at Dhulkheel,
40 m. due north of Bijapur, and opened anew campaign
against Masaud. That helpless regent besged aid from
Shivaji, who undertook the defence of Bijapur with great
promptitude. Shambhuji, who had fled from Dilir, returned
to Panhala about the 4th of December.

On 4th November, 1679 Shivaji matched out of Selgur
(55 m. w. of Bijapur). His cavalry, 18,000 strong, rapidly
moved northwards in two parallel divisions under Shivaji
and Anand Rao, and poured like a flood through the
districts of Mughal Deccan, plundering and burning all the
places in their track and taking an immense baoty
in cash and kind. In the middle of the month, Jalna,
a populous trading town, 40 miles east of Aurangabad,
was captured and plundered. Here the godly saint,
Sayyid Jan Muhammad, had his hermitage in a garden
in the suburbs. Most of the wealthy men of Jalna
had taken refuge in this hermitage with their money and

jewels. The raiders, finding very little booty in the town
and learning of the concealment of the wealth in the saint's
abode, entered it and robbed the refugees, wounding many
of them. The holy man appealed to them to desist, but they
only abused and threatened him for his pains. Then the
man of God, “who had marvellous efficacy of prayer,”
cursed Shivaji, and popttlar belief ascribed the Rajah’s death
five months afterwards to these curses.

After having thoroughly plundered and devastated Jalna
for four days, as the Marathas, loaded with booty consisting
of “countless gold, silver, jewels, cloths, horses, elephants,
and camels,” were retreating, an enterprising Mughal officer
Ranmast Kaan, attacked their rear-suard. Shidhoji Nimbalkar
with 5,000 men held him in check for three days, but was at
last slain with many of his men. In the meantime, very
large reinforcements were hastening up to the Mughals from
Aurangabad under Kesari Singh and Sardar Khan. When
these came to a halt six miles from the fighters, Kesari Singh:
at night sent asecret message to Shivaji as a brother Hindu,
advising him to run away at once before the Mughals could
complete their circle and cut him off. Shivafi trusted to his chief
spy, Bahirji, uncer whose skilful guidance the Maratha army
escaped by an obscure path afler lhree days and nights of
anxious and ceaseless marching. Bat they had to sacrifice
much of their booty, besides losing 4,000 horsemen killed
and Hambir Rao wounded. From this disastrous expedition,
Shivaji returned to Patta-garh (about 99nd November) and
rested his exhausted and = stricken army for some days, and
then, at the beginning of December, went to Raigarh.
A Maratha division raided Khandesh, in the last week of
November, burning atd plundering Dharangaon, Chopra, and
many other considerable towns adjacent to it

The character of his eldest son filled Shivaji with the
gloomiest anticipations of the future. A profligate, capricious


--- Page 243 ---
956 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cu. X]

and cruel youth, devoid of every spark of honour,
patriotism or religious fervour, could not be tefl sole
master of Maharashtra. Shivaji tried hard to conciliate
and reason with Shambhuji. But a born judge of character
like Shivaji must have soon perceived that his sermons
were falling on deaf ears, and hence his last days were
clouded by despair. On 93rd March, 1680, the Rajah was
seized with fever and blood dysentery. The illness continued
for twelve days, and finally the maker of the Maratha nation
passed away at noon on Sunday, 4th April, 1680, the
full moon of the month of Chaitra. He had not yet
completed the 53rd year of his age.

§ 15. SAtvaji’s Kingdom, army and revenue.

At the time of his death Shivaji’s kingdom included alf
fhe country (except the Portuguese possessions) stretching
from Ramnagar (modern Dharampur State in the Surat
Agency) in the north, to Karwar or the Gangavali river in
the Bombay district of Kanara, in the south. Its  castern
boundary embraced Baglana in the north, then can
southwards along an irregular shifting line through the
middle of the Nasik and Puna districts, and encircled the
whole of the Satara and much of the Kolhapur districts, A
recent but permanent acquisition was the western Karnatalz
or the Kanarese-speaking country extending from Belgaum
to the bank of the Tungabhadra opposite the Bellary
district of the Madras Presidency.

Shivaji’s latest annexation was the country extending from
the Tungabhadra opposite Kopal to Vellore and Jinji, é e,
the northern, central and eastern parts of the present

SHIVAN'S S¥STEM OF CIAUTH O37

Outside these settled or half-settled parts of his kingdom,
there was a wide and very fluctuating belt of land, subject
to his power but not owning his sovereignty. In
these he levied blackmail (KSandani, £ @, ransom, in Marathi),
as regularly as his army could repeat iis annual visit to them.
The money paid was popularly called cfHautf, because it
amounted to one-fourih of the standard assessment of the
and revenue of a place. The payment of the cfauth merely
saved a place from the unwelcome presence of the Maratha
soldiers and civil underlings, but did not impose on Shivaji any
corresponding obligation to guard the district from foreign
invasion or internal disorder. His revenue is put by his courtier
Sabhasad at the round figure of one frore of fun, while the
chauth when collected in full brought in another 80 /akfs.

ft was Shivaji's settled policy fo use his army to draw
supplies from foreign dominions every year. “The troaps were
fo go into cantonments in the home territory during the rainy
season (fune—September). On the day of Dasafara (early in
October) the army should set out from the camp for the
country selected by the Rajah, The troops wete to
subsist in foreign parts for eight months and also levy
contributions. No woman, female slave or  dancing-girl
was to be allowed to accompany the army. A soldier
keeping any of these was fo be beheaded. No woman
or child was to be taken captive, buat men only. Brahmans
were not to be molested, nor taken as hostages for ransom.

(Sansk. Mantri) who compiled a daily record of the  kRing’s
doings and Court incidents, (4) the Sucnis (Sansk, Sachiv) or
superintendent of correspondence, (5) the Dabir (Sansk. Samant)
or foreign sectetary and head of the intelligence department,
{6) the Sar-f-naubat (Sansk. Senapati) or commander-in-chief,
(7) the Pandit Rao (corresponding lo the Persian Sadr and
Muftasib in one), whose duty it was to decide theological questions
and caste disputes, to punish heresy and impiety, and to
reward learned Brahmans out of the royal alms fund, and (8)
the ANyayadfish or chief justice. All these ministers with the
exception of the Senapati were of the Brahman caste, and all
the first six of them had to take command of armies when
necessary. The actual work of Stale correspondence was
condueted by members of the Prabhu (Kayastha) caste, most of
whom knew Persian well, The pay-accounts of the army were
kept by a class of officers called sabnises (Persian Bakhsh),

But this Council of Eight Ministers was is no sense a Cabinet,
They merely acted as the king’s secretaries ; they had np
initiative, no power to dictate any policy to him by the threat
of resignation. Their function was purely advisory when the
hing was in a mood to fisten to advice, and at other times
they merely carried out his general instructions and supervised
the details of their respective departments. The Deshwa was
more honoured than the other seven Pradhans, but they were
in no sense subordinate to him. The solidarity of the Britikh
Cabinet, as well as ils power, was wanting in the Maratha

tion in his own hands, fike Louis XIV or FPedetick the

empire and all its resources. Aurangzib was in despair as to
how he could subdue Shivaji, afler seeing that nearly all his
great generals had failed in the Deccan.

To the Hindu world in that age of renewed persecution,
Shivaji appeared as the slar of a new hope, the protector of
their religion.

§ Shivaji’s private life was marked by a high standard of
morality. He was a devoted son, a loving father and an
aitentive husband. Intensely religious trom his very boyhood,
by instinct and training alike, he remained throughout life
abstemious, free from vice, and respectful to holy men. The
liberality of his faith is proved by his impartial respect for
the holy men of all sects (Muslim as much as Hindu) and
toleration of all creeds. His chivalry to women and _ strict
enforcement of morality in his camp was a wonder in that
age and has extorted the admiration of hostile critics like
Khaft Khan.

$ He had the born Icader's personal magnetism and threw
a spell over all who knew him, drawing the best elements of
the country to his side and winning the most devoted service
from his officers, while his dazzling victories and ever ready
smile made him the idol of his soldiery. His roval gift of
judging character was one of the main causes of his success,
as his selection of generals and governors, diplomalists and
secretaries was never at fault. His army organization wasa
niodel of efficiency ; everything was provided beforchand and
kept in its proper place under a proper care-taker; an
excellent spy system supplied him in advance with the most
minute information about the theatre of his intended campaign ;
divisions af his army were combined or dispersed at will over
jong distances without failure ; the enemy's pursuit or obstruc-
tion was successfully met, and yet the booty was rapidly and
safely conveyed home without any loss. His inborn military
genius is proved by his instinctively adopting that system of


--- Page 247 ---
DAO SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [ou XE

warfare which was most suited to the racial character of his
soldiers, the nature of the country, the weapons of the age, and
the internal condition of his enemies. His light cavalry,
stiffened with swift-footed infantry, was irresistible in the aye
of Aurangzib

Shivaji’s real greatness lay in his character and practical
ability, rather than in originality of conception or length of
political vision. Unfailing insight into the character of others,
efficiency of arrangements, and instinctive perception of what
was practicable anc most profitable under the circumstances
(tact des choses possibles)—these were the causes of his
success in life. (The imperishable achievement of his life was
the welding of the scattered Marathas into a nation, and his
most precious legacy was the spiril that he breathed into his
people. ‘And he achieved this in the teeth of the opposition
of four mighty Powers like the Mughal empire, Bijapur,
Portuguese India, and the Abyssinians of Janjira.

No other Hindu has shown such constructive genius ia
modern times. He has proved by his example that the Hindu
race can build a nation, found a Stale, defeat enemies ; they
can conduct their own defence ; they can protect and promote
literature and = arl, commerce and industry; they can
maintain navies and ocean-trading fleets of their own, and
conduct naval baitles on equal terms with foreigners. He
taught the modern Hindus to rise to the full stature of — theie
growth.

CHAPTER Xl

DECLINE AND FALL OF BUAPUR

§ 1. Jaf Singh's invasion of Bijapur, 1665-1666.

Aurangzib had reason to be displeased with the Sultan of
Bijapur. Adil Shah had taken advantage of the war of Mughal
succession to evade the fulfilment of the promises made by
him in the treaty of August 1657. During Jai Singh’s campaign
against Shivaji he found out that the Bijapur Government had
made a secret alliance with the Maratha chief and helped him
with lands, money and other requisites. Above all, the war
with Shivaji being over in June 1665, the vast army assembled
in the Deccan under Jai Singh’s command was slanding idly,
and profitable employment had to be found for it An
invasion of Bijapur offered the best means of doing it.

In the treaty of Purandar, Jai Singh’s clever diplomacy had
detached Shivaji from Bijapur and, indeed, thrown a bone of
perpetual contention between the two. The Maratha chief had
promised to assist the Mughals in their intended invasion of
Bijapur by furnishing 2,000 cavalry of his son Shambhuji’s
contingent as a mansabdar and 7,000 expert infantry under his
personal command.

Jai Singh also intrigued with many of the feucdatories of
Bijapur and sent them letters offering them service wrtnler the
Delhi empire. The old Mughal policy of seducing the ministers
and generals of Bijapur was pursued vigorously and with a
lavish disregard of expenditure. The most eminent of these
deserters was Mulla Ahmad, an Arab of the Navaiyat clan
settled in Konkan, who held the second place among the
Bijapur nobility. He joined Jai Singh on 29th September, 1665,

and was at once created a 6-fazati in the Mughal peerage ;
but he fell ill on the way to Delhi and died aboul 18th

December.

Before opening the campaign Jai Singh employed diplomatic
trickery, of which he was a past master, to throw Adil Shah
into a sense of false security by pretending that he had received
no order to invade Bijapur. He also made conciliatory over-
tures to Qutb Shah to induce him to stand aloof from Bijapur
in the coming war.

(at last, all his preparations being complete, Jai Singh set
out on 19th November 1665 from the foot of fort Purandar,
at the head of 40,000 imperial troopers, besides 2,000 Maratha
cavalry and 7,000 infantry under Netaji Palkar. \ During the
first month of the campaign, Jai Singh’s march was an
uninterrupted triumph. The Bijapuri forts on the way,--Phaltan,
Thathvada, Khatav, and finally Mangalvide (only 52 miles north
of Bijapur)—were either evacuated or surrendered at call. The
first battle with the enemy took place on 95th December. That
day a detachment under Dilir Khan and Shivaji marched ten miles
from the imperial camp and fought a Bijapuri army of 12,000
men under the famous generals Sharza Khan and Khawas
Khan and their Maratha allies, Jadavy Rao of Kaliani and
Vyankaji the half-brother of Shivaji The Deceanis evaded
the charges of the heavy cavalry of Dethi, but harassed
them by their “cossack” tactics, forming four divisions and
fighting loosely. Affer a long contest, Dilir Khan’s tireless
energy and courage broke the enemy by repeated charges,
and they retired in the evening. But as soon as the victors
began their return march, the elusive enemy reappeared and
galled them severely from the two wings and rear. At dawn,
24th December, Sharza Khan with 6,000 cavalry came to
the fort of Mangalvide by forced marches, The Mughal faujdar
Sarfaraz Khan, disobeying Jai Singh’s instructions, sallied out


--- Page 250 ---
1665] JAL SINGH’S MARCH ON DUAPUR 945

fo fight him and was stain. The remnant of his force fled
back to the fort.

After a two days’ stay, Jai Singh resumed his march and
on 28th December, fought another battle. The Deccani
horsemen, as usual, tried to envelop the Mughals, breaking
into several loose bodies, each of which attacked its
immediate opponent at the first sign of any weakness or
disorder in the ranks of the latter. Finally the Mughals
charged and the Deccanis gave way, but they kept up a
Parthian fight for the six miles they were chased. Next day,
99th December, Jai Singh arrived within 12 miles of Bijapur.
This was destined to be the furthest point of his advance,
because by this time Ali Adil Shah IL’s mililary preparations
had been completed, and his capital and its environs had
been rendered impregnable to altack; its regular garrison
was strengthened by 30,000 Karnataki infantry,—renowned
for their fighting quality. In addition to this, the country
round, jor a radius of six miles, had been remorselessly laid
waste; the two large tanks of Nauraspur and Shahpur had
been drained dry; all the wells in the environs had
been filled up with earth; every building had been
razed to the ground and every tree cut down, so that “not
a green branch or shade-giving wall was left standing” to
afford shelter to the invaders. At the same time a picked
farce under the noted generals Sharza Khan and Siddi
_Masaud had been sent off to invade the imperial
dominions and create a diversion in Jai Singh’s rear, while
the main Bijapuri army hovered round that general's
camp.

Jai Singh, in his eagerness to grasp the golden chance of
attacking Bijapur while undefended and torn by domestic
factions had not summoned big artillery and siege material
from Parenda fort but had arrived near Mangalvide by rapid
marches. And now his position was critical, A large army


--- Page 251 ---
DAs, SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB (cu. xii

was coming from Golkonda to the help of Adil Shah. And
the invaders were faced with slarvation.

§ 9, Jai Singh forced to retreat from Bijapur, 1666,

S6, the Mughal general began his retreat on 3th January,
1666, the Bijapuris hanging on his rear. He reached Sultanpur
fon the Sina), 16 miles south of Parenda on the 27th and
halted there for 24 days.

In this month of January, four great misfortunes befell
the Mughals. First, about the 12th, a brave Afghan captain
named Sikandar (the brother of Fath Jang Khan) when
convoying provisions, material and munitions to the army
of Jai Singh, was surprised by a superior Bijapuri force
tinder Sharza Khan eight miles south of Parenda ; he was cut
down, and all his rich convoy was plundered.

Then, on the 16th, Shiva who had at his own request
been detached to make a_ diversion in the west by
attacking Panhala, met with a dismal failure in assaulting
that fort, and lost a thousand men. About ihe 20th came
the evil news that Netaji, Shivaji’s chief officer, who was
dissatisfied with his master probably at the inadequate
recognition of his valuable services and gallant feats of arms,
had deserled to Bijapur for a bribe of four /fakfs of Aun
and led raiding parties into Mughal territory. Jai Singh lured
him back (20th March) with many persuasive letters and the
acceptance of all his high demands. The fourth misfortune
of the Mughals was the sending of 12,000 cavalry and 40,000
infantry by the Sultan of Golkonda to assist Adil Shah.

In his retreat from the environs of Bijapur Jai Singh had
io Aight two severe battles (on {lth and 22nd January) besides
almost daily skirmishes by his foraging parties. The raiding
parties of Bijapur, under Bahlol Khan and Nelaji, in the lately
annexed Bidar-Kaliani districts could no longer be ignored.


--- Page 252 ---
{666] JA SINGH’S RETREAT FROM INVASION 945

And, therefore, on 20th Feb. Jai Singh issued from his camp
at Sulfanpur and marched due east into the disturbed area.

The third stage of the war now began, which was to
end with his retreat to Bhum, 18 m. n. e. of Parenda, early
in June next. During these three months and a half Jai
Singh moved about in the small quadrilateral formed by the
Bhima on the west and the Manjira on the east, the cities
of Dharur in the north and Tuljapur in the south. In the
course of this campaign, he fought four more bloady but
fruitless battles like those described‘ before; each time the
Bijapuris were repulsed in the field and driven some distance
off, but they were not crushed, and continued as before to
hover round the Mughal camp, cut off stragglers and weak
foraging parties, and stop the arrival of supplies.

Mangalvide was too far from the Mughal frontier and loo
isolated a post to be held easily ; Jai Singh, therefore, detached
(24th May) Dilir Khan to remove the guns and material from
the fort, distribute the grain and other property, burn whatever
could nol be carried away, and dismantle the fortifications,
This was done. Phalian had been deemed untenable and
its Mughal garrison withdrawn as carly as February last
So, not a single place temained to the Mughals ott of the
gains of the first campaign.

Jai Singh’s return march northwards began on 3ist May.
Reaching Bhum (about 10th June), he halted there for 34/2
months, and then, on 28th September, started for the environs
of Bir (37 m. n. of Bhum) where he stayed till 17th November,
finally reaching Aurangabad on the 26th of that month,
Both the combatants were sick of the war, and longed for
peace; and negotiations were reopened. The Bijaputis retired
within their own frontiers when the Mughals did the same.

8 3. fai Singh's failure and death.
(i Singh's invasion of Bijapur was a_ milifary failure.
Nof an inch of territory, not a stone of a fortress,


--- Page 253 ---
246 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cn XI

not a pice of indemnity was gained by it As a financial
speculation it was even more disastrous. } In addition to
thirty fa&As of Rupees from the imperial treasury, Jai Singh
had spent more than a &rore out of his own pocket.
Profuse as Jai Singh’s payments were, they were exceeded by
the engagements he made on behalf of his master. Every
petty Muslim captain or Maratha chieftain, who offered to
desert from Bijapur, was promised a title anda high mansab
in the Mughal service, besides a large cash bounty for
equipping his retainers.

The Emperor was highly displeased with Jai Singh for the
military failure and money losses of the invasion of Bijapur.
The unhappy general received (Oct, 1666) orders to return
to Aurangabad, and on the 23rd March following (1667) he
was recalled to Court and the viceroyalty of the Deccan was
given to Prince Muazzam, assisted by Jaswant Singh. The
Rajput veteran of a hundred fighls made over charge to his
successor at Aurangabad in May 1667, and bent his way
towards Northern India in humiliation and disappointment.
Not a pice of the rore of Rupees of his own money thal
he had spent in the Bijapur war would be repaid by his
master. Broken-hearted from disgrace and disappointment
and labouring under disease and old age, Jai Singh sank in
death on reaching Burhanpur, on Qnd July, 1667.

But the Rajah had never a fair chance in this war. His
army was hopelessly inadequate for the conquest of so
large and rich a kingdom; his war material and food supply
were sufficient for a month or two only, and he had no
siege-guns. At the same time the power of the Bijapur
State was unimpaired in contrast with its exhausted condition
when Aurangzib himself captured its capital 90 years later.
Small as Jai Singh’s army was relatively to the task laid upon
i, he was badly served by his subordinates. Many of his
officers were unreliable, and refused or delayed in carrying


--- Page 254 ---
FEUDAL DISINTEGRATION OF BIJAPUR OAT

out his orders. And the imperial officers at the base did
not Reep his army regularly supplied with grain. Success
under these conditions was not humanly possible.

8 4. Military aristocracy governing Bijapur
provinces, thetr cRaracter.

Military revolt was the curse of the Bijapur sultanate,
and the decline of its royal power was attended by the
dismemberment of the kingdom into a number of military
fiefs. The government was a pure military occupation, and
its power was upheld by a number of mercenary generals
among whom all offices of power and trust were divided.
The chief races who formed the dominant aristocracy were
the Afghans (with their fiefs in the western parts, irom
Kopal to Bankapur), the Abyssinians (ruling over the eastern
provinee, viz, the Karnul district and a part of the Raichur
Deab), the Sayyids who headed the Mahdavi sect, and the
Arab Mullas of the Navaiyat clan of Konkan. The Hindus,
both public servants and vassal Rajahs, were a depressed
class. The official body that had made the State its own
was alien in otigin; but it had settled in the soil with no
idea of returning to its original homes, and it had practically
converted itself into a heredifary feudal baronage, each race
of which married within ifs own tribe and thus could not
become assimilated to the native population. This alien
aristocracy of office naturally formed no integral part of the
State. Its aim was purely personal gain, and so long as the
pay and pension of its members were secure they did not
care who was the sovereign of the country of which they
were nominally a part; they had no patriotism because they
had no patria; they were truly political Bedouins, “orphans
of the heart,” nomads who lived in India but were not
of it


--- Page 255 ---
GAS SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cH XII

The State founded on the lovalty of such public servants
is an edifice built on sand. At each foreign conquest the
people merely changed masters. Their fife was untouched
by the political change, and they, therefore, could not be
expected to rally round the crown in its hour of need, as
the cifizens of a national State are sure to do. The decline
of the Adil-Shahi monarchy merely illustrates this well-known
principle,

struggles for the regency.

Under Muhammad Adil Shah the kingdom of Bijapur
reached its greatest expansion, and stretched from the Arabian
Sea to the Bay of Bengal, across the entire Indian peninsula.
iis realm had an annual revenue of 7 K£rores and 84. lakfs
of Rupees, besides 51/1 &rores of tribute due from vassal
Rajahs and zamindars. The strength of «the army eslablishment
was 80,000 cavalry and 250,000 infantry, besides 530 war
elephants.

The storm of Mughal invasion (1657) having blown over,
the Bijapur State next showed a revival of power for some
time. Ali Adil Shah J. developecl great capacity and
enterprising spirit from 1661 to 1666. He took the field in
person, curbed the growing power of Shivaji, forced the
refractory Abyssinian officers of the N. EB. province (Karnul)
back into submission, humbled the rebel Rajah of Bednur, and
finally rolled back the flood of Mughal invasion under Jai
Singh. Thereafter the Sulfan gave himself up to the pleasures”
of the harem and the wine-cup, for the rest of his life; but
his able wast, Abdul Muhammad, continued to carry on the
administration with great success. Wilh the death of Ali Adil
Shah IL on 24th Nov. 1672, the glory of Bijapur departed.
His son Sikandar, a boy of four, was placed on the throne,


--- Page 256 ---
SIKANDAR ADIL SHAH’S MINORITY 949

and the reign of selfish regents commenced which finally
ruined the monarchy.

The history of Bijapur from 1672 to the extinction of the
dynasty in 1686 is really the history of its waazirs. It was a
period marked by chronic civil war among the factious
nobles, independence of the provincial governors, paralysis
of the central administration in the capital itself, occasional but
indecisive Mughal invasions, and a secret alliance but pretended
hostility with the Marathas.

Ali Adil Shah IL died on 24th Nov. 1672, and immediately
afterwards Khawas Khan, the Abyssinian leader of the Deceani
Musalman party, seized the supreme power and crowned the
boy Sikandar, the last of the Adil-Shahis, The new prime
minister broke his word to the other nobles and refused to
vield to them the forts "he had promised. At this, the able
and experienced ex-wasir Abdul Muhammad left the Court
in disgust. (The infancy of the king and the incapacity of the
regent threw the monarchy into a decline. Disturbances broke
out on all sides,”

“The Emperor began to send Bahadur Khan repeated
orders for invading Bijapur.” But the task was obviously
impossible for Bahadur Khan with the ordinary contingent of
a provincial governor. What the Khan did was to advance
from the seat of his government to Pedgaon (afterwards
named by him Bafiadur-garf), a strategic point on the Bhima
river 55 miles due east of Puna and nearly midway between
Aurangabad and Bijapur. His aim was to direct his main
forces against Shivaji and win territory from Bijapur by
corrupting its nobles and threatening war, rather than by
actual invasion.

The Afghans formed “more than half the Bijapuri army.”
Their leader was Abdul Karim, surnamed Bahlol Khan IL,
whose fief lay at Bankapur. Their harsh demand for arrears
of pay and open opposition to his administration had driven


--- Page 257 ---
250 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cn XU

the regent to secretly beg the aid of the Mughal viceroy in
“pacifying the Afghans or extirpating them.” So, the latter
advanced to the bank of the Bhima river, met Khawas Khan
(49th October), and arranged terms for suppressing the Afghan

faction at Bijapur and mating war on Shiva.

8 6. Regency of Bahlol Khan, (675— 1677.

Sure of Mughal support, the regent formed plans for over-
throwing Bahlol Khan, who was commander-in-chief and “used
often to disobey and oppose Khawas Khan.” The Afghan
chief, getting scent of the matter, forestalled the blow. Inviting
Khawas to a dinner, he plied him with wine, seized him,
(11th November), and sent him off as a prisoner to Bankapur.
He then entered the citadel of Bijapur and made himsalf wazie
without a blow. “Khawas Khan had been prime minister and
virtual king for three years, during which, owing to the Khan’s
indolence and incompetence, affairs went from bad to worse.
But bad as this Abyssinian’s regency had been, the rule of
Bahlol Khan and his Afghans was even worse, After seizing
the regency he began to place his Afghan followers and
relatives in power and removed the Deccanis from office, one
by one, and even expelled them from the city. Great disorder
broke out throughout the Ringdom. The Deccani party was
up in arms against Bahlol. ,

Bahlol Khan’s administration rested on the ability and
vigour of one man, his chief counsellor Khizr Khan Pani.
On 12th January 1676, this man was stabbed to death by a
Deceani. Bahlol immediately murdered the helpless captive
Khawas Khan (18th Jan.), and then set out from Bijapur to
punish Minhaj and other Deccanis. On 21st March a bloody
battle was fought between the men of Sharza Khan and_ the
army of the regent near Mokah, in which the Afghans trium-
phed. Sharza took refuge with Bahadur Khan at Sholapur,

1

who now sided with the Deccani party and denounced Afghan
rule at Bijapur. He marched southwards from Sholaput, crossiag
the Bhima near Halsangi on 3ist May; his cavalry began
to ravage the environs of Bijapur city. On 13th June, on a
plain between Aliabad and Indi (50 miles north-east of Bijapur),
Bahlo] Khan offered him battle. The brunt of the Deccani attach
fell on the Mughal right wing under Islam Khan (governat
of Malwa) and his Turks, who repelled two onsets. But his
elephant slampeded into the enemy’s ranks during a gun-
powder explosion and Islam Khan and his son were slain.
The Mughal base camp on the other side of the Bhima was
looted by the Afghans and its guards put to the sword, while
the flooded river prevented Bahadur Khan from sending
succour to it.

Bahadur Khan's position was further endangered by the
arrival of a vast Golkonda army, under the premier Madanne
Pandit, to reinforce the Bijapuris. But the new-comers were
bribed by the Mughal general, and had also (as [ suspeci
some <ifference with Bahlol Khan, and therefore retreated
without doing anything. Bahadur Khan marched on to
Halsangi, where he assembled a vast force. This huge demon-
stration of strength cowed Bahlol Khan, who then secured
satety for himself by agrecing not to hinder the Mughal
conquest of certain Bijapuri districts. Bahadur Khan now took
easy possession of Naldurg (id4th May 1677) and Kulbarga
(7th July) by bribery. But the viceroy’s position was rendered
untenable by a conflict of policy between him and his second
in command, Dilir Khan, (arrived in June 1676), who as an
Afghan beeame the bosom friend of Bahlol Khan and the
patron of the Afghan faction at Bijapur. Dilir and Bahlol
wrote io the Emperor accusing Bahadur Khan of having
formed a secret understanding with the three Deccani Powers
and of being really hostile to the success of lhe imperial
enterprises there.

8 7 Ditir Kfan and Baflol invade Golkonda, 1677.

Aurangzib recalled Bahadur, who left the province early
in September 1677, and Dilir continued to officiate as viceroy
of the Deccan till October 1678. Looking collectively at the
Mughal gains in the Deccan during the first wenty years of
Aurangzib’s reien, we find that he had in {657 annexed
Kaliani and Bidar in the north-eastern corner of the kingdom
of Bijapur; the fort and district of Parenda in the extreme
north had been gained by bribery in November 1660; Sholapur
had been acquired by treaty in July 1668; and now Naldure
and Kulbarga were annexed. Thus, the vast tract of land
enclosed by the Bhima and the Manjira eastwards up to an
imaginary line joining Kulbarga to Bidar (77° E. longitude)
passed into Mughal hands, and the imperial boundary on the
south reached the north bank of the Bhima, opposite Halsangi,
within striking distance of Bijapur  city,—while south-eastwards
it touched Mallehed, the fortress of the western border of the
kingdom of Golkonda.

After the Mughals had effected their conquests in this
corner of Bijapur, they turned to settle accounts with Golkonda.
They threatened (middie of August) @utb Shah with invasion
unless he seized and delivered up to them Shivaji and
Shaikh Minhaj,—the last of whom had taken much money from
the Mughal viceroy by promising to join him, but had ended
by going over to Golkonda. Dilir and Bahlol invaded Golkonda
in September. From Kulbarga, the last Mughal outpost, they
advanced ta Malkhed, 94 miles eastwards, the first fort on the
Golkonda frontier, which they took in one day. But near
Malkhed, 80 miles from the Qutb-Shahi capital, the tide of
invasion was arrested by vast enemy forces. The Qutb-
Shahis were posted at Mangalgi, 7 m. north of Mallhed, the
Mughal encampment (October). For two months there was
constant but indecisive fighting. The Qutb-Shahis penetrated

far within Bijapuri and Mughal territories and cut off grain
convoys coming to the invaders. The Afghans and Rajputs
in the allied army suffered terrible hardships from excess of
rain and the scarcity of grain caused by the enemy hovering
around. Bahlol Khan was struck down by a mortal iflness,
and his relaincrs dispersed fo save themselres from starvation.
Then Dilir made a disastrous retreat fo Kulbarga, the enemy
hemining him round and making daily attacks. His bagoage
was looted, and the famished imperialists had to eat the seeds
of the toddy-palm and the date-palm. ;

At Kulbarga Masaud met Dilir Khan and made peace with
the Mughals: he was to act as woair at Bijapur, but must obey
the orders of Aurangzib, make no alliance with Shivaji, and
always help ihe Mughals in wresting the Maratha chief's
usurped territory ; Adil Shah’s sister, Shahar Banu Begam
(popularly called Padishah Bibi} was to be sent to the Mughal
Court fo marry ason of the Emperor. Dilir then retired
northwards,

§ 8 Masaud becomes regent; Afghan muting ;
Rebellions in provinces of Bijaput.

Bahlol died on 93rd Dec. 1677. Masaud, escorted by a
Golkonda army, was installed as regent in February next. But
the treasury was empty. He failed to pay up the arrears of the
Aighan metcenaries, and then the exasperated Afghans broke
out in lawless fury. They seized the hotses of Bahlol Khan’s
orphans, widows anc other relatives, publicly insulting them to
compel payment of their dues, All citizens believed to be rich
were caught and tortured by them. “Chintu’ Chimna, a
Bralunan robber, oppressed the people of the city, while the
Afghans oppressed those outside the fortwalls...All the time
Masaud sat down in helplesstiess, shutting the doors of his own
house...... Many people emigrated to the Karnatak in fear.”

Nor was the new regent better obeyed in the provinces.

O54 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB {cn. XT

To crown fis misfortunes, he provoked the wrath of the
Mughals by trying fo strengthen himself by a secret alliance
with Shivaji, This breach of faith on the part of Masaud
absolved Dilir Khan from the treaty of Kulbarga, “respect
for which alone had so Iong kept him back from the invasion
of Bijapur.” At the end of the rainy season (October 1678)
Dilir Khan moved out of Pedgaon and halted at Akluj.

Meantime, Shivaji, according to treaty, sent six thousand
sieel-clad troopers to guard Bijapur and reinforce Masaud.
But hearty co-operation between the two allies was impossible ;
Shiva tried to seize Bijapur by treachery. The ill-feeling
between them daily increased and finally broke out in open
quarrel. Then Shivaji resumed plundering the Bijapur territory.
The Maratha troops approached the city, and footed the
suburbs of Daulafpur (42, Khawaspur), Khusraupur, and
Zubrapur. Masaud, in greater fear of his pretended ally
than of his open enemy, sought the protection of Dilir han
and welcomed’ a Mughal force at Bijapur.

Dili Kban made a successful diversion in favour of
Bijapur by capturing and destroying Shivaji’s stronghold of
Bhupal-garh (2 April 1679) and defeating the relieving army of
16,000 Marathas with heavy slaughter. But Masaud’s duplicity
at last wore out his patience, and he crossed the Bhima at
Dhulkhed ancl marched fo Halsangi, only 35 miles north of
Bijapur. The Adil-Shahi Government had been dissolved
and there was utter anarchy in the country and capital int
consequence of the feud between Masaud and Sharza Khan,
The Mughal viceroy of the Deccan had how become the sole
arbiter among the warring factions of Bijapur. “About
10,000 troopers of Adil Shah, consisting of Deccani Muslims,
Afghans and Marathas, entered the Mughal service and
gathered round Dilir, while only three or four thousand
slarving men remained with Masaud in Bijapur, and even
these hankered for Mughal pay.”

1679] DILIR’S 1 AST INVASION OF BIJAPUR Os

a)

Aurangzib demanded that the Sultan's sister Shahar Banu,
surnamed Padishah Bibi, should be sent to the Mughal harem,
This princess was the beloved idol of the royal family and the
citizens alike. On ist July 1679 she left the cily of her birth,
amidst the tears and wailings of the Court and the populace,
fo enter a bigoted Sunni’s house for the rest of her life.

$9. Dilir Kian invades Bijapue ; Shivaji assists
Adil Shah, 1679.

But the sacrifice of the royal maiden was of no avail to
the doomed dynasty. Mughal greed was insatiable: Dili
Khan now demanded that Masaud should resign the regency
and retire to his own fief, while the Bijapur government
would be carried on by a creature of the Mughals. Masaud
wisely rejected the proposal. The Mughal general, being
thus openly defied, at once declared war against Bijapur.
But his own position was really weak; his treasure-chest was
empty, while his soldiers’ pay was in arrears. Secondly, the
new viceroy of the Deccan, Prince Shah Alam, was his
sworn enemy, and tried his best to foil his undertakings and
cover him with discredit. Dilir Khan was thus brought to a
halt at the very outset of the campaign, and wrole entreating
the prince for money. Masaud utilized the delay in
strengthening the defences of Bijapur; he sent an envoy to
Shivaji appealing to him to come to the rescue of Adil Shah
in his supreme need. Shivaji’s response was prompt He
told off 10,000 Maratha cavalry to aid Masaud, and despatched
9,000 ox-loads of provisions to Bijapur.

The Mughals took possession of Mangalvide (52 miles
north of Bijapur) and the country between the Bhima and the
former fart, in September 1679. They also raided Salotgi,
Kasigaon, and Almala, and besieged Akluj, but without success.
Dilir Khan reached Baratgi (6 m. n. @& of the capital) on 7th
October. But distracted by the opposition of Shah

Alam, the censure of the Emperor for his delay in effecting
the conquest, and quarrels among his counsellors and allies,
he saw failure staring him in the face. Shivaji had arrived
at Selour (midway between Panhaia and Bijapur) with a new
division 10,000 strong, ane had been joined by his advanced
division, of the same strength, under Anand Rao, (31 Oct.
1679). On 4th November he divided his army into two
bodies: one, 8,300 strong, under his own command, marched
notth-east by way of Muslah and Almala, while the second,
10,000 men led by Anand Rao, entered Mughal territory by
the Sangula route (north-westwards.)

With an army swollen to 30,000 horse, he spread a fan
of freebooters and raided the imperial dominions in = all
directions from the Bhima northwards to the Narmada,
plundering, burning, and slaying.

8 10. Dilir ravages the country round Bijapur and
attacks the capital.

Stung by the Emperot’s reproaches, Dilir Khan resumed the
campaign. Despairing of taking Bijapur by siege or coup’ de
main, and afraid of being attacked by Shivaji in the rear if
he opened siege-trenches, the Mughal general left the environs
of the city on 14th November and marched wesiwards, intend-
ing to invade the Miraj-Panhala region. His first work was
to ravage the Bijapuri territory with insane cruelty. The
villages in his path were utterly sacked; all their men, both
Hindus and Muslims, were faken prisoner for being sold into
slavery ; and the women committed suicide by jumping down
into the wells with their children. On 920th November,
Shambhuji fled away from Dilir’s camp to Bijapur, and
thence arrived at Panhala about the 4th of December,

From Ainapur Dilir Khan had faced round. Making a
wide detour round the south side of Bijapur city, he raided


--- Page 264 ---
1680] DILIR RAVAGES BYAPUR DISTRICT O57

the fertile and flourishing valleys of ithe Don and _ the
Krishna,—the former of which was known as the granary
of Bijapur,—laid waste all the gardens, fields, and villages
on the way, took all their inhabitants prisoner, and then
reached Aliabad (6 miles n. e. of the city) on 4th December.
From this place he used to mareh out daily with his guns
and men and exhaust his ammunition soldiers and horses by
wildly firing at the impregnable fort-walls from one point
or ano ther every day.

The quarrel between Shah Alam and Dilir Khan daily
grew bitterer ; the Emperor wrote a strong letter of censure
lo the general. Dilir’s position before Bijapur was no longer
tenable. Tis army refused to obey him. So, on 29th January
1680, he broke up his camp at Begam Hauz and began his
retreat, after having wasied 56 days before the fort of Bijapur.
He next roamed about like a mad dog, slaying and looting
with fiendish cruelty, needlessly inflicting unspeakable misery
on the innocent peasants, and turning into a barren wilderness
the region from Bijapur cily southwards fo the Krishna and
eastwards to the fork between the Krishna and the Bhima.
Practising his usual brigandage all the way, Dilir Khan next
invaded the Berad country whose capital was Sagar, then
ruled over by Pam Nayak, and reached Gogi (0th Feb., 1680),
He met with a crushing defeat when he tried to assault Sagar
(8 miles south of Gogi). The Berad infantry, sheltered behind
the parapet of the fort, hillocks and even boulders, plied
their matchlocks with deadly effect on the Mughal troops
densely crowded in the village.

The imperial cavalry galloped away in a panic, assailed
in their backs by the fleet-footed Berads and piteously erying
for mercy. The Mughal casualties mounted up to 1,700 men
on that day. The spirit of his soldiers was utterly broken and
they even declined his offer of Rs. 5,000 as bounty for facing
the enemy again.

811. Diliv Khan is disgraced and recalled, 1680.

At last utterly disgraced he set out on his return journey,
on 23rd Feb., moving northwards along the east side of
Bijapur, burning the villages on the route and seizing the population
for ransom. His officiating viceroyalty of the Deccan had
ended in October 1678, when Shah Alam had arrived at
Aurangabad to fill that office for the fourth time. The prince
continued in the Decean till May, 1680. His supine
administration was rendered more than usually barren of
success. The Emperor was displeased and recalled both Shah
Mam and Dilir, appointing Khan-i-Jahan (Bahadur Khan) as.
subahdar of the Deccan for the second time. This general took
over charge from Shah Alam at Aurangabad in May, 1680.

8 19. Aurangzib’s policy towards Bijapur
from 1680 to 1684.

For four years after Dilir Khan's failure and _ retreal
(February 1680), nothing decisive was done by the
Mughals against Bijapur, as they were harried and distracted
by the fertile audacity of Shambhuji. Aurangzib wrote a
friendly etter to Sharza Khan, the leading general
of Bijapur, (3th July, 1681), pressing him to co-operate
with the Mughal generals in crushing Shambhuji and
recovering the Bijapur territory he had usurped; Shahar
Banu, the Bijapuri princess recently married to Azam, also sent
a personal appeal fo Sharza (18th July) to the same effect,
But no response came from any Adil-Shahi officer to the
Emperor's appeal for co-operation. The Emperor received
repeated and clear proofs of the help that the Marathas used
to get from the Bijapuri Government. So, Aurangzib decided
to increase the pressure on Shambhuji by making a diversion
against the Bijapuris and compelling them to concentrate their
resources on the defence of their own realm. In April 1689,


--- Page 266 ---
1685] HOPELESS CONDITION OF BIAPUR GOVERNMENT 959

a large force was sent under Prince Azam to enter Bijapur
territory. He ravaged the frontier, took the fort of Dharur
{about 140 miles north of Bijapur). The campaign languished
for many months, and the prince had not advanced further
south than the Nira river when he was recalled to Court
(une {683). A few months later these cesultory atlacks on
Bijapur ceased for a lime.

The condition of Bijapur was now hopeless. Five years’
wazit-ship at the decadent Court of Adil Shah had thoroughly
disgusted Siddi Masaud. “With all bis efforts he faiied to
reform the government or restore order in the administration.
No man from peasant to chieftain ate his bread in peace of
mind for a single day : none from king to beggar slept in
happiness for a single night” Despairing of improving the
administration, he left the Court on @isi November 1683, and
formally resigned his post on reaching his fort of Adoni. Aga
Khusrau was invested with the robe of wazir on 19th March
1684, but died in six months ({1th October). At this time
vigorous steps were taken for the defence of the realm :
Sikandar entrusted this task (3rd March 1684) to his bravest
general Sayyid Makhdam, surnamed Sharza Khan; his vassal
Pam Nayak of Wagingera was invited to come to the capital
with his Berad clansmen, who were the best shots in the
country. .

On 30th March, a letter was received from Aurangzib,
calling upon Adil Shah as a vassal, fo supply provisions to
the imperial army promptly, allow the Mughal troops a free
passage through his terrifory, supply a contingent of 5 or 6
thousand cavalry for the Emperor’s war with the Marathas,
abstain from helping or harbouring Shambhuji, and expel
Sharza Khan from his country |! In the meantime the Mughals
continued to appropriate bits of the Adil-Shahi kingdom and
establish their own outposts in it, At the end of May, Khan-i-
Jahan took possession of Mangalvide and Sangola and their


--- Page 267 ---
262 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB (cH. X.

a Golkonda force, and finally on 10th December a second
army from Shambhuji under Hambir Rao. \

Prince Azam had arrived close to the fort of Bijapur on
29th June, 1685, but in less than a month he had to fight three
severe battles with the enemy. On ist July his trenches were
assailed by Abcur Rauf and Sharza Khan, and several Muzhal
officers were wounded and slain. Next day the Deccanis
fell on the supplies coming to the siege-camp and evidently
cut them off.

8 14. Prince Azam in danget, is relieved by Firuz Jang.

A famine broke out in his camp; the  oft-ravaged
neighbourhood of Bijapur could yield no food supply, the
roads from the north were closed by the activity of the
Marathas and the flooded streams, as the rainy season had
now set in. “Grain sold at Rs. 15 a seer, and thal joo in
small quantities.”

For lack of men the Mughal outpost at Indi, midway
between Sholapur and Bijapur, had been withdrawn, and thus
the road from the imperial base to the sicge-camp was
now closed. Aurangzib saw no other means of saving
his son than by ordering him to relire from Bijapur with
his army. The prince held a council of war ; they all voted
for a retreat. But the  prince’s spirit had been roused ; he
would not reduce himself to the level of his rival Shah Alam,
who had recently come back from Konkan covered with
dismal failure. Turning to his officers, Azam exclaimed, “You
have spoken for yourselves, Now listen 1o me Muhammad
Azam with his two sons and Begam will not retreat from
this post of danger so long as he has life. After my death,
His Majesty may come and order my corpse to be removed
for burial. You, my followers, may stay or g0 away as
you like.” Then the council of war cried out with one voice,
“Our opinion is the same as your Highness’s |”

1685] AZAM AT BIJAPUR REINFORCED 263

When this Spartan resolution of his son was reported to
Aurangzib, he at once took steps to send relief. 5,060 pack-
oxen were despatched to convey food, with treasure loaded
on many hundred spare remounts, and much munition to the
prince, A strong escort under Ghagi-ud-din Khan Bahadur
Firuz Jang left the imperial camp with the party on 4th
October, 1685, and fought its way to the famished army,
after repulsing Sharza Khan at Indi. The artival of Firuz
Jang “turned scarcity into plenty in the Mughal camp, and
the famished soldiers revived.” [lis next success was the
cutting off of a force of 6,000 Berad infantry, each man
carrying a bag of provisions on his head, which Pam Nayak
tried to smuggle into the fort at night. Early in October,
Haidarabad, the capital of Qutb Shah, was entered by Shah
Alam unopposed, its ruler having shut himself up in Golkonda.
Many of his officers deserted to Shah Alam. The Mughal
control over the Qutb-Shahi State was confirmed in March,
1686, when the prime minister Madanna Pandit—who had
pursued a policy of alliance with Bijapur and the Marathas,—
was murdered.

§ 15. Suferings and difficulties of Mughals
at siege of Bijapur.

By this time (une 1686) the siege of Bijapur had dragged
on for 15 months with no decisive result,

Discord and mutual jeaiousg had broken out among
the Mughal commanders. The Emperor realized that unless
he took the command in person, the fort would not fall. On
i4th June 1686 he left Sholapur and on 3rd July reached
the Rasulpur suburb west of the fort. Orders were at once
issued fo press the siege vigorously. The city was completely
beleaguered. Prince Shah Alam, now the eldest living, com-
manded the sector opposite the north-western or Shahpur
gate and wanted to steal a march over his brother Azam,

the general in charge of the siege. [le opened a correspon-
dence with Sikandar Adil Shah and his officers to effect the
peaceful surrender of the fort and thus rob Azam of the
credit of being called the captor of Bijapur. One of his con-
fidential officers, Shah Quli, even used to enter the fort in
secret to negotiate with the garrison. The matter became the
talk of the camp and reached the ears of Muhammad Azam
Shah and of the Emperor. Shah Alam was censured; some
of the officers incriminated were thrown into prison and the
others were expelled from the camp. The sufferings of the
besiegers were aggravated by a scarcity which was raging in
the Deccan on account of the failure of rain that year. But
the sufferings of the besieged were ten limes worse.
“Countless men and horses died within the fort,’ and from
Jack of horses the Deccanis could not follow their favourite
factics of hovering round their enemy and cutting off stragelers
and transport. In the extremity of the siege, a deputation of
Muslim theologians issued irom the city and waited upon
Aurangzib in his camp, pleading,« “You are an orlhodox
believer, versed in Canon Law, and doing nothing without the
warrant of the Quran and the decrees of theologians. Tell
us, how you fustify this unholy war against brother Muslims
like us.” Aurangzib was ready with his reply. “Every word
you have spoken is true. I do not covet your territory.
But the infidel son of the infernal infidel (meaning Shambhuji)
stands al your elbow and has found refuge with you. He
is troubling Muslims from here fo the gates of Delhi, and their
complaints reach me day and night. Surrender him to me
and the next moment I shall raise the siege.” The scholars
were then reduced to silence.

Shortly after Aurangzib's arrival the sap had been carried
to the edge of the moat, bul the filling up of the ditch seemed
an impossible task. “From the fort walls the artillery struck
down whosoever reached the edge of the ditch, None durs!

show his head.” For three months the broad and deep moat
remained unfilled.

Aurangzib on 4th September advanced his tent from two
miles in the rear to a place immediately behind: the trenches.
Thither he rode fully armed, by a covered lane, and veceived
the salule of the investing officers. Next he rode to the
edge of the moat io inspect the battery raised to command
the fort bastion and to learn for himself why the conquest
was delayed.

8 16. The fall of the last king of Bijapur.

Bijapur fell a week after this date, but not to assault.
The garrison now lost heart. (The cause of the Adil-Shahi
monarchy was hopeless: the king was a plaything in the
hands of selfish nobles; all hope of help from outside was
gone, The future was absolutely dark. ) The garrison had
by this time shrunk to 9%000 men. In the night of 9th
September the secretaries of the two Bijapuri leaders, Nawab
Abdur Rauf and Sharza Khan, waited on Firuz Jang and
opened negotiations for surrender. Aurangzib received them
with favour.

(Sunday, 12th Seplember, 1686, saw the downfall of the
Bijapur monarchy. Amidst the tears and lamentations of his
subjects who lined the  slreets, Sikandar, the last of the
Adit-Shahi Sultans, gave up his ancestors’ throne)and issued
from the capital of his house, at one o’clock in the afternoon,
in charec of Rao Dalpat Bundela and went to Aurangzib’s
camp in Rasulpur.

Meantime the large tent which served as the Hall of
Public Audience in Aurangzib’s camp, had been richly
decorated for this historic scene. When Sikandar arrived, a
train of high officers welcomed him and ushered him into
the Presence. The fallen monarch made his bow at the foot
of the conqueror’s throne. His extreme beauty and combined


--- Page 271 ---
266 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cu. Xl

grace of youth and royally excited universal admiration and
pity for his fate. Even Aurangzib was touched: he spoke
soothingly to Sikandar. The deposed Sultan was enrolled
among the Mushal peers with the title of Kf#an (lord), and
a pension of one /a&fi of Rupees a year was settled on
him. All the Bijapuri officers were taken over into Mughal
service. On 19th September, the victor, seated on a portable
throne, rode into the fort by way of the trenches of Saf
Shikan Khan and the southern or Mangali gate, which had
once been chosen for the assault. Along the roads of the
city he marched, scattering handfuls of gold and silver coins
right and left, and viewed the fort walls and bastions and the
palaces within the citadel. Then he went to the Jama Masjid
and rendered two-fold prayers to God for His favours. In
Sikandar’s palace he rested for some hours and received
congratulatory offerings from his courtiers, All paintings on
the walls drawn in violation of the Quranic law that man
should not presumptuously vie with his Creator by depicting
living beings, were otdered to be erased, and an inscription
recording Aurangzib’s victory was placed on the famous
eannon Malik~t~maidan.

Complete desolation settled on the city of Bijapur
after the fall of tls independent dynasty. Two years
after its conguest, a terrible plague swept away more
than half its population. A few years later, Bhimsen noticed
how the city and its equally large suburb Nauraspur looked
deserted and rtined; the population was scattered, and
even the abundant water-supply in the city wells had suddenly
grown scanty! Bijapur henceforth continued as a dismal
example of departed greatness,—a vast city covered with
“long lines of fallen houses, ruined mansions and lonely
patches of jungle.” ,

The last Adil-Shahi Sultan was for sometime lodged in the
State-prison of Daulatabad. Later, he was again carried about

with the camp of Autrangzib, as a captive. In this condition
he died outside Satara fort on Srd April 1700; he had not
yet completed 32 years of age. According to his last wishes,
his mortal remains were carried to Bijapur and there buried
at the foot of the sepulchre of his spiritual guide Shaikh
Fahimullah, in a roofless enclosure.

CHAPTER XII
THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE QUTB SHAHS.

814. Accession of Abul Hasan Quib Shah, 1672.

Abdullah Quib Shah, the 6th king of Golkonda, , had
succeeded his father in 1626, at the age of twelve, and
reiened for 46 vears, during the whole of which he was a
mere puppet on the throne. The actual administration was
conducted for more than 40 years by his mother, Hayat
Bakhsh Begam, a lady of strong character, and after her
death (1667) by Abdullah’s eldest son-in-law Sayyid Ahmad.
Abdullah was, throughout his life, indolent and almost imbecile ;
he never appeared in public to give audience and administer
justice according to the custom of the country, nor did he
venture outside the walls of the fortress Golkonda. Confusion
and misrule were the natural and unavoidable consequences
of this state of things.

Abdullah had no son, but three daughters, the second of
whom had been married to Aurangzib’s son Muhammad
Sultan, and the first to Sayyid Ahmad, who claimed descent
from one of the noblest families of Mecca and who rose
by his ability to the position of prime minister and de facto
ruler of the State. It was proposed ‘to marry the third
princess to Sayyid Sultan; but on the day fixed for the
marriage, Sayyid Ahmad told Abdullah that if he gave his
daughter to Sayyid Sultan, he would at once leave the kingdom.
A burried search was made for another match for the princess.
The choice of the palace agents fell on Abul Hasan, a youth
descended on his father's side from the Qutb-Shahi family,
who had spent the last 16 years in the lazy pampered life
of a monk by entering himself asa disciple of the saint

1675] MADANNA, FAVOURITE OF QUTB SHAH 969

Sayyid Raju Qatial. This man was led to the palace and
forthwith married to the princess.

On Qist April, 1672, Abdullah died, and at once there
arose a dispute for the succession. After some confusion
and fighting, Sayyid Muzaffar, a leading general of high
Persian origin, supported by Musa Khan mafaldar and several
other officers of the harem, overpowered Sayyid Ahmad and
forced him into prison. Abul Hasan was crowned king,
Muzaflar becoming his prime minister. But within a few
months, Abul Hasan bought over Madanna, the Brahman
factotum of Muzaffar, and through him corrupted mos{l of the
captains of his personal followers, so that one day Muzafiar
was quietly deprived of his wazir-ship, which was conferred
on Madanna, with the title of Surya Prakash Rao. This
change of ministers took place about 1673 and Madanna’s
rule continued fill his own assassination in 1686, on the
eve of the fall of the kingdom. His brother Akkanna became
commander-in-chief and his nephew, the gallant and learned
Yengana surnamed Rustam Rao, was given a high command.
Muhammad Ibrahim, a creature of Madanna, was at first creaied
premier peer.

During the bwelve years of Madanna's ministry the internal
administration of the country was marked by the same
disorder and tyranny as in the reign of Abdullah, and matters
nalurally declined from bad to worse, “and nothing is thought
of but peeling and squeezing the people.” Madanna continued
the same foreign policy as before, but with a necessary
variation. There was no estrangement from the Adil-Shahi
Government, but that Court was now the scene of chaos,
faction-fights and changes of regency. Madanna, therefore,
built his hopes of national defence chiefly on a close alliance
with ihe eyer-victorious Maratha king, and promised him a
regular subsidy of one Jakh of fun for the defence of
Golkonda.,

8 9. Mugfal policy towards the Golkonda King,

(So long as Bijapur stood, Golkonda was safe. Aurangzib
knew it, and therefore did not try to annex the latter first.
Nor was it necessary for him to do so, as he found it more
profitable and cheaper to fleece and terrorize the Qutb-Shahi
Government than to extinguish it”) The Mughal “Resident” at
Haidarabad domineered over the Ring and the people, insulted
and taxed them, but without provoking armed protest.

Resigning his royal functions to his wazir Madanna, Sultan
Abul Hasan shut himself up in his palace with a host of
concubines and dancing-girls. Under his predecessor, Haicdarabad
had become the Indian Babylon, with its twenty thousand
public women (who had io dance before the king in the
public square every Friday) and its countless taverns, close to
these women’s quarters, where 1,900 large leather bottles of
fermented palm-juice were consumed daily. But he also
promoted several fine aris contributory fo luxury; he settled
in his capital and supporled by his bounty — skilled craftsmen of
various kinds whose exquisite manufactures were famous
throughout India. The king’s own skill in music was of no
mean order. He was tightly called Tana Shah or “the dainty
Ring.”

The enormous wealth of the country was derived from its
well-watered fields which at once arrest the eye by their
greenness and abundance of tropical fruits as the traveller
enters the State from the arid and sterile region round Bijapur,
its rich mines of diamond and iron, and its prosperous ports
on the east coast from Chicacole southwards to St. Thome.
The king had a secure income of 2% Kroves of Rupees, For
nearly thirty years after Aurangzib’s accession io the throne,
the Ringdom of Golkonda had enjoyed respite from Mughal
attack ; the pre-occupation of the Mughals with Shivaji and
his patron Adil Shah had prevented them from turning to

1665-66, under Dilir Khan in 1679 and under Prince Muhammad
Azam in 1685, the Sultan of Golkonda had openly sent his
troops to assist his brother in distress. The first two of these
acts had been condoned, or atoned for by the payment of
tribute. The last brought ruin on him. But, in the eyes of
Aurangzib his worst offence was his fraternizing with infidels,
He had effectively helped Shivaji with the sinews of war after
his flight from Agra in 1666 and thus enabled him to recover
his forts from the Mughals. Again Qutb Shah had rapturously
welcomed Shivaji on his visit to Haidarabad in 1677 and
behaved like a humble vassal of the Maratha king, placing a
necklace of gems round his horse’s neck and promising him
an annual subsidy of one /akA of fun for the defence of his
territory. Above all, he had made the Brahmans Madanna and

Akkanna, his chief ministers, and thus allowed Hindu influence
to predominate in his administration.”

8 3. Wor with the Mughals and capture of
Haidarabad, 1685.

C aurangeib had begun his attack on Bijapur (in March
1685) by warning Abul Hasan not to assist Sikandar Adil
Shah in any way. )But at the end of June, a letter from Abul

* As the Emperor wrote to his envoy at the Golkonda Court, “This luckless
wretch (meaning Abul Hasan Qutb Shah) has given the supreme power In his
State fo a fafir and made Sayyids, Shaikhs and scholars subject to that man, He
has publicly allowed (in his realm) all kinds of sin and vice (/z., taverns, brothels,
and gambling houses). Ue himself is day and night sunk in the deadly sing, through
the intoxication of kingship, and fails to distingulsh between Islam and infidelity,
justice and oppression, sin and piety. By refusing to respect God's commands
and prohibitions, by sending afd to infidel Powers,,.,. and by recently paying one
lakh of Guz to the &afiy Shambhu, he has made himself aceyrsed before Gad and
man.'' (K. K,, it. 328).

Hasan to his agents was intercepted, in which he had written,
“The Emperor is a great man, and has acted magnanimously
up to this time, but now, finding Sikandar a helpless orphan,
he has laid siege to Bijapur and pressed him hard. It is,
therefore, necessary thal while the Bijapur army and Shambhu,
with his countless hordes, are offering resistance from one
side, I should, trom this side, send 40,000 men under Khalilullah
Khan to enter into the war. We shall then see on which
front the Emperor can meet and repel! his enemies.”

At this Aurangzib at once delached Prince Shah Alam with
a vast army fo march on Haidarabad. But when the imperial
vanguard approached Serum, 8 miles east of Malkhed, it found
its path barred by a Golkonda army; the Mughal advance
was stopped and the troops fell back on Malkhed. Every day
there were skirmishes with the enemy. Khan-i-Jahan ran up
walls round his camp at Malkhed and practically stood a
siege there.

After a time the prince arrived with reinforcements and the
Mughals, depositing their baggage at Malkhed, sent their
vanguard again under Khan-i-Jahan to hack a way towards
Haidarabad. The Deccanis outnumbered this force as three
fo one, and there were frequent fights. Each such encounter
was followed by a halt of three or four days on the Mughal
side, It was already August, and the heavy rain caused great
hardship to the Mughal troops and impeded their advance.
Their daily losses at last took the heart out of the Mughal
soldiery. So, the imperial generals halted and wasted hwo
months in the neighbourhood of Malkhed without fighting.
Then a stinging rebuke from the Emperor and an unusually
audacious act of sniping on the prince’s camp, roused him to
seek battle again, After a very bloody contest the Deccanis
were pushed back to their camp. Next morning it was learnt
that they had fled towards Ilaidarabad. The cause of _ this
stidden breakdown of the Deceani resistance was dissension

{685] SECOND CAPTURE OF HAIDARSBAD 975

befween the commander-in-chief Mir Muhammad [brahim,
and his second in command Shaikh Minhaj, and the seduction
of the former by the Mughals. The prince, being now
unopposed, rapidly marched towards Haidarabad.

The flight of the commandet-in-chief paralysed the defence
of Haidarabad. Qutb Shah didnot know whom to trust; he
fled to Golkonda fort. The king’s flight to Golkonda was sa
precipitate that all his property was left behind. When the
people of Haidarabad learnt that the city had been abandoned
by the Government and that the enemy were athand, there was
a mad scramble to flee to the fort The confusion was
aggravated by the incliscriminale looting which began
immediately. The city presented the spectacle of a sack
after assault by an enemy. In every ward, street, and market-
place, there were lakhs of Rupees worth in cash, property,
China-wate of the nobles and tradesmen, and carpets of the
king and the aristocracy, besides horses and elephants. These
were looted in the midst of a terrible uproar. Many Hindu
and Muslim wives and children were kidnapped and some of
them outraged.

Next day Shah Alam senta party of his soldiers to protect
the citizens, but these men themselves joined in the plunder !
After two days the prince appointed Khan-i-Jahan to police
the city, and he succeeded in restoring order to some extent.
The Mughal army made this its second entry into Haidarabad
about 8th October 1685. Qutb Shah continued to send agents
to the prince, helplessly appealing to him to make peace. At
the prinee’s recommendation, which reached the Court on
18th October, the Emperor consented to pardon Abul Hasan
on the following conditions: (1) He must pay one <Krore and
20 lakhs of Rupees in settlement of all past dues, and in
addition a tribute of 2 /akAs of Aun every vear. (2) He must
dismiss Madanna and Akkanna. (3) He must give up all claim to
Malehed and Serum, which the imperialists had already occupied,

8 4. Murder of Madanna, 1686.

Shah Alam stayed for some months, first close io
Golkonda, and afterwards at Qutb Shah’s request he withdrew to
Kuhir, (48 miles n. w. of it), waiting for the collection of the
wat-indemnity. Abul Hasan put off the dismissal of Madanna
as fong as he could. At this his discontented nobles lost all
patience. They regarded Madanna as the cause of all their
sufferings at the hands of the Mughals. A plot was formed
against Madanna by the discontented Muslim nobles, whose
leader was Shaikh Minhaj, and by Saruma and Jatti Sahiba,
the widows of Abdullah Qutb Shah, who now ruled over the
king’s harem with despotic powers. One night, early in March,
1686, just after Madanna had left his master’s presence, he
was set upon and murdered in the streets of Golkonda by
Jamshid and other slaves. AkRanna shared his brother's fate
on the spot. Their brave and accomplished nephew, Rustam
Rao, was pursued to his house and there stabbed fo cleath.
The minister's family residences were plundered. Next, a
general attack was made by the mob on the Hindu quarter
of the fort and “many other Brahmans lost their lives janid
property in that night” The Dowager Sultana now sel the
heads of the obnoxious ministers to Aurangzib as the Best of
peace-offerings. The Emperor recalled Shah Alam to, his side
at Sholapur, where the prince arrived on 7th junds 1686,
Golkonda territory was now completely evacuated by the
Mughals. Bijapur feli on the 19th September of that year,
and its fall set the Mughal forces free lo deal finally with the
Quib-Shahi Government. .

8 5. Auvangzib besteges Golfonda, 1687,

On the 28th of January, 1687, the Emperor arrived within
two miles of Golkonda. Meantime, Abul Hasan had again


--- Page 280 ---
1687] GOLKONDA FOR DESCRIBED 275

fled from his capital to this fort, and the city of Haidarabad
was occupied for the third and last time by the Mughals.

Two miles due west of the stone bridge over the Musi
river which connects the two parts of the city of Haidarabad,
lies the fort of Golkonda. It is an irregular rhombus, with
a rough pentagon (the Naya Qifa) annexed to ils north-eastern
face. A strong crenellated wall of granite, over four miles in
lensth and of great thickness, surrounds the fort, which is
further defended by 87 semi-circular bastions, each from 50
fo 60 feet high and built of solid blocks of granite cementect
together, some of them weighing more than a ton. The eight
massive gates could have safely defied any artillery known fo
the 17th century, Outside is a deep ditch, 50 feet broad,
with stone retaining walls. But Golkonda really consists of
four distinct forts joined fo each other and included within
the same lines of circumvallation. The lowest of these is the
outermost enclosure into which we enter by the Fath Darwaza
near the soulh-easlern corner; if is a vasl tract covered with
mansions of the nobles, bazars, temples, mosques, soldiers’
barracks, powder magazines, stables and even cultivated fields.
Here the whole population of Haidarabad used to live in
times of danger. Proceeding inside along the grand main
road for some 1,250 yards from the Path Darwaza, and
leaving a set of rather laler palaces, harems and offices on
a low site on the right, we arrive at the Bala Hisar gate,
which leads us, over a flight of steps, to a higher area with
exceedingly lofty and strong walls and containing a capacious
three-storied armoury, magazines, stables, mosqties, audience
chambers, harems, gardens, large wells with sleps, and even
two setais and a temple of the monkey-god | Further west,
some 200 steps cul in the solid rock lead the traveller up to
the very apex of the fortress, the Bala Hisar (or Upper
Fort), standing on a bed of solid granite, ts walls being
formed by huge boulders with here and there connecting

curtains and parapets that tower far overhead. This is the
citadel of the citadel, the kernel of the whole fort
At the north-eastern corner of the fort stands a mound
commanding parts of Golkonda ; but it was enclosed by a
wall and added to the fort, under the name of the Naya Qila
or New Fort, by king Abdullah as a defensive precaution after
Aurangzib’s first siege in 1656. North, south and even west
of this fast area are large tanks, and the water-supply of
the fort was unfailing. North of the fort at a distance of a
mile and a quarter, runs a low range of bare fantastically
piled up hills skirted by the great old road from Sholapur and
the west Here Aurangzib is said jee“have established his own
quarters at the last siege.

The Mughal attack was directed on the south-eastern and
southern faces of the fort, their soldiers moving along both the
north and south banks of the Musi, while the n. w. gate was
bombarded only as a feint

Arrived within view of Golkonda, Aurangzib at once
ordered his generals to assail and drive away the enemy’s
troops who-had assembled in the dry = diteh under
shelter of the fort walls. One charge of the imperialists
swept them away, or as the Mughal official history
puts it, “the wind came and the gnats fled away ;” and
ther property, wives and — children were captured.
Qalich Khan (the grandfather of the first Nizam) tried
fo enter the fort pell-mell with the fugitives and capture
it by one stroke. But he was hil on the shoulder-blade by a
zamburak bullet from the fort walls, and in spite of alt the
remecties irfed by the doctors, he died after three days. Regular
siege operations were therefore begun, on 7th February.

§ 6. Sfafi Alam imprisoned.

But at the very outset the Emperor’s arms were paralysed
by biller personal jealousies in his camp. Prince Shah Alam


--- Page 282 ---
1687} SHAH ALAM ARRESTED BY AURANGZIB OTT

was of a soft pleasure-loving nature, and constitutionally averse
fo strenuous cxertion and heroic enterprise. He did not wish
to see a brother sovereign like Abul Hasan utterly ruined.
This generous impulse was mingled with a more sordid feeling :
if he could induce Abul Hasan to sue for peace throuch his
mediation, then he himself would be proclaimed in the official
reports as the captor of Golkonda. Abul [lasan’s avents
secretly visited Shah Alam with costly presents, begging him
to use his influence with the Emperor to save Abul Hasan’s
{hrone and dynasty. The prince gave encouraging replies.
In thus negotiating behind the Emperor’s back and with an
enemy beyond hope of the Emperor’s pardon, Shah Alam
was playing a dangerous game. And he had enemies in the
camp ever on the look out for a chance to ruin him. His
rival Azgam’s partisans revealed to the Emperor the secret
of the communications passing between Shah Alam and Abul
Hasan. An order of Shah Alam fo bring his women’s tents
closer to his headquarters, really as a precaution against
surprise by the enemy, strengthened Aurangzib’s suspicion that
the prince was meditating flight to the enemy's fort with his
family, All doubls were set at rest when Firuz Jang intercepied
and showed to the Emperor one night some letters which the
prince had been trying fo send to the fort.

Aurangzib acted promptly: imperial troops were at once
posted as guards round the prince’s camp. Next morning
(Qist February), Shah Alam with his four sons was invited to
the Emperor's tent for consultation. After a few minutes’
talk with him, they were asked by the wagirto step into a
side-room (the chanel) with him to hear some secret instruc-
tions of the Emperor. There they were politely asked to
consider themselves as prisoners and surrender their swords,
The prince’s entire family was imprisoned, his property attached,
his iroops distributed among other commands, and his trusted
eunuchs tortured to make them divulge their master’s

278 SHORE HISTORY OF AURANGZIB feu. XU

treasonable plots. The more the prince protested his innocence,
the more did the Emperor's anger flame up; he increased the
rigours of Shah Alam’s captivity and ordered that he should
not be allowed fo cut his hair or pare his nails, nor be
supplied with delicate food, cooling drinks or his customary
dress. It was seven years before Shah Alam recovered his
liberty. After the arrest of the prince, the Emperor hurriedly
broke up his Court, ran to his wife Aurangabadi Mahal, anv
kept slapping his knees ancl moaning, “Alas! Alas! { have
razecl to the ground what I had been rearing up for the last
forty yeat's.”

8 7. Aurangeib’s difficulties at Golkonda siege.

But Shah Alam was not the only discordant element in the
sieae-camp. The many Shias in the imperial service heartily
disliked the prospecl of the extinction of the last Shia kingdom
in India. Aparl trom the Shias, this war of extermination
against Abul Hasan was condemned by many orthocox Sunnis
even, as an unprovoked “war between Muslims” and therefore
sinful. The upright and saintly Chief Justice, Shailzh-ul-[slam,
had counselled the Emperor not to invade the two Decanni
sulianates, and on his advice being rejected he had resigned
his high post and retired fo Mecca. His sticeessor in affice,
Qazi Abdullah, tendered the same unpalatable advice and was
packed off to the Base camp !

This natural distrust of Shias hindered the Emperot’s
business. At first the only high and distinguished officer at
the siege was Firuz Jang, Saf Shilean Khan, the Chief of
Artillery, was a Dersian ancl jealous of the superior position
and favour enjoyed by Firuz Jang, a Turk. After working
strenuously for some fime, he resignecl “in order to spite
Firez Jang.” Salabat Khan succeeded him, but failed to do his
work well, and resigned in a short time. The next Chief of
Artillery was Ghairat Khan, who was surprised by the enemy

1687] MUGHAL FAILURES AT GOLKONDA 979

in a state of gross carelessness and carried off as a_ prisoner.
Then the post went abegging for some time to the ruin of the
siege operations. Then at last, Saf Shikan Khan was taken
out of prison and restored to this office (22 June 1687). But
by that time the field-works constructed after five months of
toil, had been demolished by the enemy, and the investment had
to be begun anew. The siege had been started on 7th February.
But the fort had an inexhaustible supply of munitions and its
walls bristled with guns of large calibre. Day and night the
garrison kept up an incessant fire on the approaching Mughals.
Every day some men were slain or wounded on the Mughal
side. But the dauntless courage and tireless perseverance of
the troops under Saf Shikan carried the sap to the edge of
the ditch in about six weeks. The next step was to fill the
ditch and make a path for the assaulting column.

While these slow operations for breaching and assault were
going on, the commander-in-chief, Piruz Jang, made an atlempt
to fake the fort by an escalacle, on {6th May. He stole out
of his camp at9 pm, and on reaching a bastion where the
enemy's sentties were asleep, he planted a ladder against the
wall and sent two men up to the rampart. The two other
ladders he had taken with him proved too short, and so a
rone-ladder was fastened to the top of the gate. By chance
a pariah dog was standing on the wall, seeking a path for
descending to the moat and feeding on the corpses lying there.
Alarmed bythe appearance of strangers, it set up a loud bark, which
roused the garrison, and they drove away the Mughals. To
the Muslims the dog is an unclean animal. But this dog had
saved the capital, Abul Hasan rewarded his canine deliverer
by giving it a gold chain, a collar set with jewels, and a gold
embroidered coat, and styling it Seffabga ot “Peer of three
degrees,’—-in mockery of Firuz Jang’s three titles of Kfan,
Bd6adue, and Jang—and remarking wittily “This creature has
done no less a deed (than Firuz Jang) 1”

The garrison promptly retaliated for the surprise that had tailed,
by making a sortie onthe raised battery and slaying the arlillery-
men. The siege operations had ceased to make any progress
for some time past,on account of the confusion in the artillery
branch. The enemy’s fire was still unsubdued, and the ditch
far from filled up. The Mughals also now fell into the grip
of famine, The Deccanis and their Maratha allies infested
the roads and prevented the transport of grain to the Mughal
camp. Then, in June, the rain descended in torrents, the
swollen water-courses and rivers became impassable, the
roads were turned into quagmires. No provisions could
reach the besiegers. The incessant rain of the middle of
June completely spoiled the siege-works. The raised gun-
platforms collapsed into mud-heaps; the walls of the trenches
fell down and blocked the passages; the camp became a
sheet of water out of which the white tents stood up like
bubbles of foam.

8 8 Sortles of the gartison : heavy Mughal losses.

The enemy seized the opportunity. In the night of [5th
June, amidst a deluge of rain, they raided the Mughal
advanced batteries and trenches, slew the carcless artillerymen,
drove nails into the port-holes of the guns, destroyed the
stores of sapping and gun material, then fell onthe officers, and
carried off into captivity Ghairat Khan (the Chief of Artillery),
Sarbarah Khan (a trusty old servant of the Emperor)
and twelve other high officers. It was only after three
days of struggle and with the assislance of a fresh
division that the enemy could be expelled and ,the
ruined battery re-occupied by the Mughals, Abul Hasan
ireated the captive Mughal officers very kindly, gave them
rich presents and sent them back to the Emperor, Vigorous
measures were taken to retrieve the late disaster and
press the attack home. Three mines hac been carried
from the siege-trenches to under the bastions, and they were


--- Page 286 ---
1687] ASSAULT ON GOLKONDA FAILS 281

ready by {9th June, each chamber stored with 500 maunds
of gunpowder and the fuses laid.

The next day was fixed for the explosion of the mines
and the delivery of the assault, which the Emperor went to
supervise in person froin Firue Jang’s trenches. The Mughal
froops, as ordered, rushed out of their trenches and made a
noisy feint against the undermined bastion in order to induce
the enemy to crowd at this point and then to kill vast
numbers of them by the explosion! Early at dawn the first
mine was fired, but the force of the explosion was directed
outwards ; a vast mass of rock and earth from the glacis
was hurled upon the Mughal ranks crowded below: “In a
lwinkle of the eye the flying splinters killed 1,100; imperialists,
while the fort walls remained intact.”

The enemy seized the opportunity by making a sally and
attacking the confounded Mughals, and then seized the
trenches and outposts which it had taken the Mughals four
months to make and occupy. A force sent by the Emperor
drove them out and recovered the position after a long
contest and heavy loss. This had been hardly effected when
the second mine was firect with the same disastrous conse-
quences, Again the splinters of the blown-up tower fell on
the Mughals, and killed more than a thousand of them.
The enemy then made a second sortie and took possession
of the Mughal field-works and shelters. A severe struggle
for them now took place; Firuz Jang was wounded with
lwo other generals, Rustam Khan and Dalpat Rao Bundela,
while vast numbers of his men were slain.

At the news of this serious check, Aurangzib himself, girt
round by his staf, advanced from his station in Firuz Jang’s
‘ent to aid his hard-pressed troops. Cannon-balls began to
fall near his portable throne (fokft-i-rawan), and one of them
carried away an arm of his body-servant (ffawas). But he
coolly kept his position and cheered his soldiers by his example.

While the battle was raging, a tropical storm burst
on the = plain’ with all the violence of wind rain and
thunder. The rain continued to descend in torrents;
the dry nalafs and even low paths became rushing
streams. The Mughals, assailed by men and the gods, gave
way; and then the Deccanis made their third sortie of the
day. They seized the trenches further off and the elevated
gun-platforms, carried off as many guns as they could and
destroyed the others. The big planks, beams and thousands
of bags filled with earth which the Mughals had thrown into
the ditch were quickly removed inio the fort and used in
repairing the breach caused by the explosion! By this time
the plain of battle had been turned into a lake of mud. At
sunsel the defeated Mughals retired to their quarters ; the
Emperor spent the night in Firuz Jang’s camp.

8 9. Mughal failure ; famine and pestilence.

Next morning (ist June) he issued forth again to fire
the third mine and try his fortune by another assault under
his own eyes. The mine did not explode at all. It was then
learnt that the enemy had discovered it and flooded {he chamber
with water. The baffled Emperor stole back to his own
tent “without ceremony.” “Various other plans were — tried,
immense wealth was spent, but the siege dragged on.” The
morale of the imperial army was utterly gone. The famine
grew worse than before, and pestilence appeared as its in-
separable companion, The city of Haidarabad was utterly
depopulated ; houses, river, and plain were all filled with
corpses. The same condition prevailed in the Mughal camp.
At night piles of the dead used {to accumulate. After some
months, when the rains ceased, the white piles of skeletons
looked from a distance like hillocks of snow.

Aurangzib with grim ftenacily sat down to starve the fort
into surrender. “The Emperor decided to build a wall of

time it was completed and guards were placed at ifs doors.
ingress and egress being forbidden except on the production
of passports.” At the same time, to prevent the garrison
from getting fresh supplies, Aurangzib issued a proclamation
annexing the kingdom of Haidarabad. [le appointed his own
magistrates and revenue-collectors for all places in it
The Kfulba was read in the Emperor's name and a
Censor of Public Morals (muftasib) was posted by him
at Haidarabad.

S10. Golkonda surrendered by treachery.

On 21st September, after the siege hac lasted nearly
eight months, Golkonda was captured by bribery. An Afghan
soldier of fortune, named Abdullah Pani, surnamed Sardar
Khan, who had ceserted Bijapur service for the Mughal and
then left the Mughals fo join Abul Hasan, now sold
his master to the enemy. He left the Aik or postern gate
of the fort open, and at his invitation a party of Mughal
soldiers under Ruhullah Khan entered the fort unchallenged,
at about 3 o’clock in the morning of @1st September, 1687.
They posted some men within to hold the ground and then
opened the inain gate through which the flood of Mughal
invasion now poured into the fort, Prince Azam with the
supports advanced from the river to the foot of the wall

One last feat of the purest heroism casi its radiance on
the fall of Golkonda and redeemed its infamy. When the
cxullant Mughals were swarming into the fort and making
their way to the palace, a single rider who had had no time fo
gird his belt on or put saddle on his horse’s back, felf like a
lunatic on that myriad of enemies, ff was Abdur Razzaq
Lari, surnamed Mustafa Khan, the one faithful man among
that faithless crew of Golkonda. Throughout the siege he
had tejected with scorn all the bribes of Aurangzib, including

a command of Six Thousand Cavalry in the Mughal army,
saying that “he would rather be ranked among the 72 faithtul
companions who perished with the Iman Husain at Karbala
than with the 292,000 traitors who overcame him.” Alone
he rushed against the flood of invaders, shouting, “While |
live, here will be at least one life sacrificed in defence ot
Abul Hasan.” But covered with 70 distinct wounds, one
eye badly damaged, and his horse reeling from wounds and
loss of blood,—Abdur Razzaq no longer saw the path berore
him, but did his best merely to keep his seat and gave his
horse the loose rein. The animal escaped from the press
and dropped him near an old cocoa-nut tree in the Nayina
Bagh garden near the citadel. Thence he was removed to
the Mughal camp and nursed back to life by order of the
Emperor,

§ 11. Abul Hasan made captive.

In the meantime, when the roar of ihe advancing Mughals
reached the cars of Abul Hasan, he came out to the audience
chamber and sat down on the throne calmly waiting for his
unbidden guesis. When at last Ruhullah Khan and his party
entered, Abul Hasan greeted them kindly, and behaved with
royal dignity throughout the painful scene. Then, after
bidding his caplors to breakfast with him, he finished his
meal and left the palace. In the evening he was presented
by Azam to the Emperor. After a time he was sent to
Daulatabad, and there sighed out his captive life on a pension
of Rs. 50,000 a year. At the moment of leaving his throne
and passing into the rigours of captivity under a sworn enemy,
Abul Hasan showed a self-control and a dignity which surprised
his captors. To their cries of admiring surprise he replied
that though born of royalty he had been trained in youth in
the school of poverty, and knew how to take pleasure and
pain with equal indifference as gifts of God, “who had mace

he spoils tagen at Golkonda amounted to nearly seven
krores of Rupees in cash, besides gold and silver plate, jewels
an) jewelled ware. The revenue of the conquered kingdom
was 2 Krores and 87 lakhs of Rupees.

« % Ky ii, 363-36), But Dr. Careri (in Churchill’s Voyages, iv. 249) and Manucci
(ii. 30¢--"8) speak of his being insulted and beaten when taken to Aurangzib. Ishwardas
tells the characteristic story that at the time of his capture Abul Hasan was merry-
making with his dancing-girls and musicians and, when the yirls stopped their dance
in alarm at the entrance of the enemy, he cried out to them, “Geo on dancing as
before. Every minute that I can spend in pleasure is a great gain.” Firuz Jang
raised him from his throne and led him, mounted on 4 hoarse, to the Emperor's
presenec. Abul Iasan, without making furnish or salam walked in erect. The
Emperor asked, “How are you?’ Tle replied, “TI neither rejoice.....nor grieve, But

The report entered in the Fort St George Diary on 12th Now. (687 is more reliable
than Manucci’s account. It runs thus: “..News from the French, Dutch and other
nations that the Mughal had taken Golkonda fort by treachery on the 2nd of last

CHAPTER XIV

REIGN OF SHAMBHUII, 1680-1689,

8 1. The disputed succession ; Shambfufi
makes himself King.

The death of Shivaji left the newly created Maratha
kingdom utterly divided and distracted, while the future looked
very uncertain. His eldest son Shambhuiji’s licentious character
promised an unhappy reign to his subjects, while his recent
desertion to the imortal enemy of his faith and fatherland
had discredited him in the eyes of alt rightdihinking men.
Indeed, his wise father in his last days, after vainly trying to
reform Shambhuji, had been constrained to keep him under
surveillance in the fort of Panhala. Therefore, after Shivaji’s
funeral, Rajaram (his younger son, a boy of ten) was
proclaimed as king by the ministers present in Raigarh, on
the lead of Annaji Datto.

This change in the natural order of succession was effected
by a party only at the capital. The people in general and
the troops outside had not been consulted, and they naturally
murmured.

The crowning of Rajaram gave the sienal for a division
among the Marathas. A faction for Shambhuji was soon
formed. The army, gorged with plunder in Shivaji’s time,
seems to have received no bounty at this change of masters
and was eager to transfer ils venal sword to Shambhuji,
whose helpless condition made him reckless in his promises
for gaining adherents. The council of regency as constituted
at Raigarh meant Brahman rule, and the commandet-in-chiet

parties of soldiers began to flock daily to Shambhuji at
Panhala, and he openty assumed royal powers, ignoring the
Government at Raigarh.

Shambhuji's first measures displayed a degree of  sagacity
and fimely energy which was quite unexpected from a man
of his character. He first made himself master of Panhala
and then consolidated his possession of the South Maratha
country and South Konkan before venturing on a contest
with the forces of his rival at the capital in the north.

In the meantime, Annaji Datto had placed Rajaram on the
throne at Raigarh, on Q1st April, and shorily afterwards
sfatted for Panhala with the Peshwa, ostensibly for ihe
purpose of recovering that fort and imprisoning Shambhuji.
But the news of the successful coups of Shambhuji  dis-
heartened them and they hesifated to atlack him. Soon, the
hands of the selfish double-dealing ministers were forced by
the ariny. At the end of May the commander-in-chief,
tlambir Rao Mohité, arrested Annaji and Moro Pant and took
them as captives to Shambhuji at Panhala. ‘There all the
army chiefs assembled and recognized Shambhuji as their king.

Annaji was cast into prison, loaded with chains; the
Peshwa made a timely recantation and thus gained Shambhuji’s
favour without his trust. The new king then set out for
Raigarh, his army swelling to 20,000 men during the march,
The capital opened its gates to him (18th June). Rajaram
made no opposition, because he was incapable of making any.

Though deposed, he was treated “with all kindness,”
because he had been a mere tool in the hands of more
designing men.

Shambhuji first sat on the throne on 20th July. The
formal coronation was performed with full ceremony and

splendour on [6th January 168f. A son and heir was born
to him on i8th May 1682, who was destined to revive the
Maratha kingship about 30 years later. [tf was Shivaji IL,
popularly known as Raja Shahu.

§ 9, SfiambAhuji renews war with the Mughals.

The ‘new monarch gained a long respite from foreign
attacks, All the military resources of the Mughal empire
were then concentrated for the war with the Rajputs under
the Emperor’s own eves. At the end of October the Maratha
armies were out, as usttal, after Dashafara. One division,
both horse and foot, was designed to march towards Surat
and another towards Burhanpur, while a third kept Bahadur
Khan (recently created [han-i-Jahan) in check by forming a
screen before his encampment near Aurangabad. The news
of the raids, however, quickly drew the Mughal general into
Khandesh (about 25th Nov.) and the Marathas retreated from
the province, but if was for a time only.

At the end of January next (1681) the raiders were back
again, evidently emboldened by the news of Prince Akbar’s
rebellion, which rumour had exaggeraled into the downfall
of Aurangztb, One band under Hambir Rao sacked
Dharangaon, and other towns in North Khandesh, and,
passing further east, fell on the Bahadurpura suburb of
Burhanpur, (30th Jan.) before their approach was even
known, and there gathered an immense quantity of booty
from the numerous shops and houses in ik Seventeen other
wards (puras) outside the city-walls were similarly plundered.
The surprise was so complete that none could conceal or
remove a penny worth of property, or save his wife and
children. The smoke of the burning houses first informed
the governor of the enemy's presence, but he was powerless

to do anything and merely shut himself up in the fort.

sec

For (three davs the Marathas looted the suburbs to their
hearts’ content, without the least interruption, and dug up the
floor of every house, thus discovering the buried treasure of
many generations past. Khan-i-Jahan was too slow in coming
up and misjudged the route of the raiders, so that they escaped
with all their prisoners and booty. Popular voice in the
Deccan charged the Mughal viceroy with having been bribed
by Shambhu to follow this wrong sirategy. The citizens of
Burhanpur complained to the Emperor to this effect and the
Muslims threatened to stop their Priday prayers unless they
were assured of the safety of their life and honour in future.

At Babulgaon, some 26 miles west of the city, Khan-i-Jahan
learnt that another Maratha band was coming up from the
south, by way of Ahmacnagar and Mungi-Pattan to loot
Aurangabad. He took horse imniediately and set off with his
cavalry at 3 o'clock in the morning, arriving near the city at
noon, just in time to save it The city was in the wildest
terror. All houses were closed, the men sitting armed and
irembling and the women weeping within doors, As soon as
the Khan artived, the enemy fled without fighting.

As usual, after the Dasfafara day in October 1681, the
Maratha light horse set out to rove in different directions. An
attack on Ahmadnagar was actually altempted, as two Maratha
princesses (a wife and a sister of Shambhuji) captured by
Dilir Khan were lodged in that fort and the Marathas wished
to rescue them. Some Maratha’ soldiers who had secretly
entered the fort in disguise were detected and killed by the
qgiladar and the rest driven away after a fight, (end of
October).

8 3. Prince Akbar seeks retuge with Shambhujt.

Prince Muhammad Akbar, the rebel son of Auranvzib,
crossed the Narmada near Akbarpur (th May) under the
guidance of the faithful Durgadas Rathor and made his way to
Maharashtra. On crossing the Mughal frontier he was
welcomed by several high officers of Shambhuji and conducted
with honour to Pali (1st June).

The prince was accompanied by 400 cavalry, a small body
of infantry (mostly Rajputs with a few Muhammadans) and 50
camels for transport.

Three hundred Maratha foot soldiers were told off to form
his body-guard, and Shambhuji’s subafidars (collectors) near
about waited on him to pay their respects. Netaji Palkar was
left in attendance upon him as Shambhuji’s representative.

§ 4. Conspiracy against Shambhuji ; Kavikalash
becomes fis favourite.

After gaining Raigarh (18 Tune 1680), Shambhuji imprisoned
his chief enemies, including their leaders, Annaji Datto and
Nilkanth Moreshwar Pinglé (the son of the Peshwa Moreshwar
Trimbak). Early in October Moreshwar died, and Shambhuji
set his son Nilkanth free and bestowed the vacant prime
ministership on him. He also released the arch-traitor Annaji
Datto from prison and appointed him to the post of
Accountant-General (Majmuadat).

But in August 1681, Annaji Datio formed a conspiracy
with Soyra Bai, Hiraji Farzand, and some other leading men
to murder Shambhuji and give the throne fo Rajaratn, under
the protection of Prince Akbar. They intended to bill
Shambhuji by putting poison in his food.

But the plot was revealed, and Shambhuji immediately
seized the traitors, flung them into prison, and put them to
torture. Annaji Datto his brother Somaji, Hiraji Farzand,.


--- Page 296 ---
1682] KAVIKALASH, SHAMBHUJI'S FAVOURITE 204

Balaji Avji Prabhu, and Mahadevy Anant, with three others
were killed by being flung in chains under the feet of
elephants. Twenty more culprits were sentenced to death
later. Rajararn’s mother, Soyra Bai, was charged with having
poisoned her husband (a year and a_ half earlier), and was
put by Shambhuji to a painful death, through poison or by
starvation. All this happened in October 1681. Her father’s
family, the Shirkés, fell under Shambhuji’s persecution; many
of their members were killed, and the rest fled to the Mughals.

Shambhuji’s character and conduct made it impossible for
any of the old servants of the State to regard him with that
love and devotion which Shivaji had inspired. On his part, he
could never forget that practically all the notable ministers
and generals had at first given their assent to removing him
from the line of succession. He, therefore, felt that he stood
absolutely alone and friendless in his native country; and his
whole reign was in fact disturbed by frequent conspiracies and
desertions among his officers and rebellions among his vassals.

In this forlorn situation he seemed to have gained a truly
devoted servant A Kanauji Brahman, who had been the
hereditary priest of the Bhonslé family at Allahabad, arrived
at Raigarh shortly before Shambhuji’s grand coronation. He
soon made his way into the Rajah’s heart, and monopolized
his trust and the supreme control of the administration, with
the title of Xavi-kalasfh or Pinnacle of Poets, while Shambhuji
rapidly became a faineant king, blindly following the minister's
advice, and devoting all his time to wine and women, with
fitful outbursts of martial vigour.

In his obseure village refuge Prince Akbar kept up the
pageant of an Emperor as far as his reduced means allowed.
Mercenary horsemen were constantly joining him, and by the
month of August he had collected about 2,000 cavalry in his
pay. On 13th November, 1681, Shambhuji interviewed Prince
Akbar at Padishahpur (Pali), faking the entire army and

retinue with him, Durgadas was with Akbar. But Akbar’s
sole chance of success by invading the Mughal empire
was now gone, The — crisis of the Rajput war had ended
in June, when the Maharana made a definite peace with
the Emperor. The Mughal forces were now free to hunt
Akbar down, and the Emperor himself arrived at Buchanpur on
i3sth = November. Thus, by the middle of November
all the military resources of the empire were concentrated
in the Deccan under the Emperor himself, three of his sons
and all his best generals. At first he contented himself with
following a watchful and waiting policy.

8 5. Aurangzih’s strategic dispositions, 1682.

Shambhuji was busy during the whole month of January

1682 in making a furious attack on Janjira under his own
eyes. This was Aurangzib’s opportunity. Sayyid Hasan Ali
Khan descended from Junnar into North Konkan at the head
of 14,000 horse and took possession of Kalian (about 30 Jan.
1682) burning all the Maratha villages on the way.
In May next he withdrew from the province, in order to save
his horses from the effect of the heavy rainfall of the west
coast. .
Aurangzib arrived at Aurangabad on 22nd March 1689
and sent off Azam Shah and Dilir Khan to Ahmadnagar in
the south, while Shihab-ud-din Khan with Dalpat Rao was
sent to Nasik on the western frontier. The latter general
took some simall forts in this region and then (in April)
laid sieve fo Ramsej, 7 miles north of Nasik. But it was
defended by a gallant Maratha garrison under an expert
giladar, and the Mughals could make no impression on it.
The Emperor sent Khan-i-Jahan to reinforce the siege. But
even this great general could achieve uo better success ; two
assaults failed with heavy losses.


--- Page 298 ---
1689} DOINGS OF MUGHAL GENERALS 293

Aurangzib's spirit was now up. He decided on extensive
operations against Shambhuji. As the English at Karwar
write, “He is so inveterate against the Rajah that he hath
thrown off his pagri and sworn never to put it on again,
till he hath either killed, taken, or routed him out of his
couniry.” (G0th July 1689). Ile sent Ruhullah Khan (3rd
May) and later Muizz-ud-din (@8th Sep.) to defend the
Ahmadnagar distric while Prince Azam was sent towards
Bijapur (14th June) to overawe that State and prevent it from
aiding or sheltering Maratha bands, From Nasik Shihab-ud-din
Khan was transferred to Junnar (June), while Ranmast Khan,
the able lieutenant of Khan-i-Jahan, was promoted to the
command of an independent army corps (Sep.} and ordered
to invade Konkan.

Khan-i-Jahan continued the siege of Ramsej for some
months more, delivered another assault which failed, and then
gave up the siege, (October 1689).

Ranmast Khan entered Konkan and occupied Kalian, late
in Nov. 1682. Rupaji Bhonslé and the Peshwa opposed him
fo no effect, though they fought many battles with heavy
slaughter.

Khan-i-Jahan united with the prince's force at Ramdoo, on
the Godavari, 25 miles s. of Aurangabad, and pushed on
eastwards to Nander. Thence the division went to Bidar, 86
in. due south, Next he pursued the raiders in a long running
fight, which carried him to the frontiers of Chanda and
Golkonda. It was a highly creditable feat. During this cam-
paign his troops had to bear great hardship.

Prince Agam in June 1682 marched out of Ahmadnagar io
invade Adil-Shahi terrifory. In the course of this campaign
he took Dharur. Then he entered Shambhuji’s territory and
leaving his wife Jahanzeb Banu (popularly called Jani Begam)
behind in his camp, with Rao Anurudh Singh Hada and his
Rajputs to guard her, he advanced with his army further into


--- Page 299 ---
294 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cn. XIV

the enemy’s country. The Marathas, sending off one division
to keep Azam engaged, suddenly threatened the Begam’s
camp in overwhelming force. The heroic daughter of Dara
Shukoh mounted her covered fitter on an elephant, and advanced
two miles from her camp to oppose the enemy.

Calling Anurudh Singh near her elephant she spoke to
him in fet own voice, ‘The honour of the Chaghtais is to
the Rajputs the same as their own honour. [call you my
son. If God gives us victory with this small force, well.
Otherwise, you may rest assured about me; I shall sit down
afler doing my work (te, committing suicide, in order to
avoid capture).” Then a great battle was fought. Nine
hundred Rajputs fell on Anurudh’s side, and many of the
Marathas too. At last Anurudh gained the victory, though he
was wounded. After some time spent on the bank of the Nira,
Azam was recalled to Court in June 1683.

8 6. Failure of Mughal efforts : Emperor's
distraction and suspicions.

In March 1685, all the Mughal divisions operating against
Akbar were recalled to the Emperor’s side. Ruhullah and
Ranmast Khan evacuated Kalian on Q3rd March, after burning
and razing the ground the fortifications they had built
round the city. The retreat was opposed by a Maratha
army under Rupaji Bhonsle, who attacked the Mughal rear
at Titvala (seven miles n. e, of Kalian), killing many men and
carrying off a large number of horses,

Thus we see that for more than a year after his arrival
in the Deccan, from November 1681 to April 1683, the
Emperor accomplished nothing notable, in spite of his immense
resources. In truth, he was at this time passing through a
domestic and mental crisis; his faith in his family had been
totally shaken and he did not know whom to trust or where

1683] MARATHA NAVAL POWER 295

he would be safe, Hence his policy for some time after
was hesitating, suspicious, watchful and seemingly capricious
or self-contradictory. On 2nd October 1683, the Surat
factors write, “low the king’s mind may alter we cannot tell.
Tt is continually wavering and he is extraordinarily peevish
and uneasy because of Sultan Akbar. Sultan Azam, Begam
[4 e, Jahangeb Banu} and Dilir Khan degraded for even
nothing bul only suspected, without any grounds, of being
Rind to Akbar, that all persons of quality stand on ticklish
ferms, are mighty careful.”

§7. The Maratha navy and wars with the
Siddis, 1680-82,

There could be no amity between the English and
Shambhuji, because the Siddi fleet, as well as occasional
Mughal squadrons from Surat, used fo pass the stormy
monsoon months (May to October) in the safe shelter of
Bombay harbour every yeat, and the Siddis settled in the
Mazagaon qttarter of the island, from which they frequently
ravaged the Kurlas or rich low-lying tracts of Maratha
ferrittory on the mainland east of Bombay. Shambhuji by
turns threatened the English and offered them his alliance
if they would only exclude the Siddis from their harbour ;
but the President and Council of Surat instructed Bombay,
“You must use all contrivances to keep fair with them, as
we would by no means quarrel! with Shambhuji Rajah, so
upon no account can we with prudence fall out with the
Siddi at present, it being a very unfit time.”

The Maratha vessels being smaller in size and armament
than the Siddi’s, lay sheltered up the Nagothna creek and
in Khanderi harbour during the monsoons, without venturing
on pitched battles. But occasional skirmishes took place
between the rival gallivats (/albas) in which the Siddis had


--- Page 301 ---
996 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cu. XIV

the advantage, and these seas were offen closed to the
Maratha trading vessels.

On 7th December, 1681, the Siddis burnt the lown ot
Apta, on the Patalganga, ten miles south of Panvel. (They
had first sacked it in 1673). “On this provocation Shambhuji,
accompanied by Sultan Akbar, came down from Raigarh, with
20,000 men and a vast train of cannon, to Danda, {18 Dec...
and from the hill opposite to Janjira” bombarded that island
incessanily for 30 days. But the Muyhal invasion of N.
Konkan and capture of [Kalian (c¢ 30 Jan.) forced him to
hasten back to Raigarh.

In July 1682, the Marathas getting some boats together
delivered an assault on Janjira, but they could gain no footing
on the storm-beaten rocky coast and had to retire with heavy
loss.§ On 4th October, Siddi Misti (in Maratha service) with
30 gallivats gave battle to Siddi Qasim’s squadron of [6
vessels, crowded with his best men, off Kalgaon, 8 miles south
of Kolaba Point. But he was defeated after a brief, fight, his
other vessels fled away, and he was carried a ptisoner,
mortally wounded, with seven of his vessels to Bombay.

§ 8. Sfambhuji’s war with Ihe Portuguese, 1683.

Shambhu’s wrath fell on the Portuguese. They had given
him provocation by seizing and fortifying Anjidiv, an island
just south of Karwar, which the Maratha king had intended
to make his naval base, to counteract. the Sidd{ stronghole
of Janjira (Apr. 1689). In December 1689, the viceroy of
Goa had allowed the Mughal ships to pass under the
Portuguese fort of Thana up the creck to Kalian, with provi-
sions for the Mughal army under Ranmast Khan, then ravaging
that district. He had also allowed the Mughal army a free
passage through the Portuguese province of Daman
(“the North”) to the Maratha district of North Konkan.


--- Page 302 ---
1683| SHAMBHUU}L ATTACKS PORTUGUESE 997

For these breaches of neutrality Shambhuji vowed vengeance
on the Portuguese. On Sth April 1683, he launched his attack
on them. With 1,000 horse and 2,000 foot he raided the
open town of Tarapur and burnt it and all other towns from
Daman to Basein. On 3ist July, his Peshwa, with 6,000 infantry
and 2,000 cavalry, laid siege to Chaul. Early in the morning
of Sth August the Marathas made an assault on the city,
but were repulsed with heavy loss. At midnight following
29th August, the Porluguese Viceroy sent a large body of
the Indians of Goa across the river to the mainland of Savant-
vadi, with a general licence to plunder and burn the villages
of Shambhuji. This attempt to imitate the Maratha policy of
mulkgirt was a failure. But Chaul remained unconguered
by the Marathas after a siege of many months.

The Viceroy of Goa planned to make a diversion by
laying siege to Phonda; with 800 while troops and 8,000
Kanarese, and five pieces of heavy artillery, he arrived (on
29nd Oct) in the vicinity of Phonda and opened fire on that
fort immediately.

The 30th of October had been fixed for scaling the
breach of the inner wall. But that very day a relieving force
under Shambhuji was sighted, the Portuguese army was com-
. pletely outflanked and lost heart, and decided to raise the
siege, Next day they began to retreat, and on the ist of
November reached Durbata, where they were to embark for
return to Goa.

The retreat from Durbata was disastrous for the Portuguese,
The Maratha cavalry attacked the Goa infantry with great
determination. “The Kanarese [ée, the native troops of
Goa}...threw down their muskets and fled. Finally, nearly
all the Portuguese did the same, but in vain, for the blacks
tode over them, trampling most of our men. All our men
fled iri utter disorder, each one trying to save himself... Of
ihe Portuguese infantry nearly a whole company of seamen


--- Page 303 ---
998 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB fcn. XIV

were killed, the dead and wounded amounting to byvo
hundred.”

§ 9. Shambfuji invades Goa.

From the walls of Phonda Shambhuji marched with 7,000
cavalry and 15,000 infantry against Goa city. Af 10 o’clock in the
night of 14th November, forly Marathas entered the island of
Santo Estevao, two miles north-east of Goa, by crossing a
channel which is fordable at low tide. Then they scaled the
fort on the top of the hill, and were soon reinforced by
four thousand men from their main army from the other
side of the river.

. Next morning at 7. o’clock, the Viceroy with 400 men
disembarked at the island of . Sanio Estevao, and
vigorously attacked the Maratha infantry.. But. three hundred
cavalry reinforcing them, “they fell. upon our men with great
fury..Our men began a headlong flight down the hill. .Besides
the dead, who were said to be more than 150,—there. was
not one who was not wounded by a ball, sword or stone.
The Viceroy had his arm pierced by a ball. At two o’clock
in the afternoon he embarked.The rest of the men,—about
120,—fled into the river..Some stuck. in the mud, and some
swam off. All those who were in the mud died. But next
day (J6th Nov.) the Marathas. left. the island in © great
haste,”

On {st December one thousand Maratha horse, and 3,000"

town belonging to Shambhuji) on 3 Jan. 1684, and three days
later a very powerful Mughal fleet reached the harbour of Goa.
At the news of the prince’s approach Shambhuji fled (3rd
December) to Raigarh, leaving Kavi-kalash with Akbar to
negotiate with the Portuguese for a peace.

In the northern theatre of this war, £e, Daman district, the
Portuguese were severely beaten. Many of their towns were
taken and burnt by the Marathas ; on 22nd December Shambhu
occupied the island of Karinja, only 10 miles south-east of
Bombay. After Shambhuji had hurriedly fled northwards to his
capital, leaving Kavi-kalash as his plenipotentiary for concluding
a peace with the Portuguese through the mediation ot
Akbar, these two at first took refuge from the Mughals
in the forest of Bhimgarh (97 m. east of Goa) and
then at Phonda, and made peace with the Portuguese
envoy, Manuel S. de Albuquerque (about 20 January) on
the basis of the mutual restitution of conquests and prizes and
neutrality in future.

But this treaty was a hollow truce. The Maratha king soon
prepared for a second encotinter with ihe Portuguese, On 19th
September the Portuguese attacked and recovered Karinja
island. Languid hostilities with the Portuguese continued till
the end of Shambhuji’s reign.

§ 10. Prince Akbat’s designs and disappointments
at the Maratha Coutt.

Shambhuji was frittering away his strength in small predatory
incursions here and there, or engaging in fruitless wars with
the Siddis and the Portuguese, having “too many irons in the
fire’ to do anything effective, as the Surat factors rightly
rematked in December 1685.

Akbar’s one thought was, how to gain the throne of Delhi.
He valued Shambhuji only as an instrument of this design.


--- Page 305 ---
300 SHORT IISTORY OF AURANGZIB [en. XIV

Every day that he spent in Maharashtra was a day more of
hope deferred. ft was also a day more of unwonted suffering
to him. Only by feaving Maharashtra could he get back to
civilization.

But Shambhuji’s interests did not exactly coincide with ARbar’s,
Why should he go out of the safety of the Deccan hills and
jungles into the broad plains of North India where his troops
would lose their natural advantage ? Why should he denude
his country of its defenders by accompanying Akbar in the
wild project of invading Hindustan, and thus give Aurangzib
an opportunity of conquering Maharashtra in his absence ?

At last after 18 months of heart-sick waiting, hope
deferred, and evasion of promises, Akbar saw through
Shambhuji’s character and policy and despaired of ever being
effectually helped by him. He, therefore, decided to leave
Maharashtra. He issued from his asylum at Pali (Dec. 1689)
with his Rathor contingent, and {ook up his residence at
Banda in Savant-yadi, which though lying within the Maratha
kingdom, is only twenty-five miles north of Goa. From this
place Akbar Qanuary 1683) sent an agent to the Viceroy of
Goa, presenting him with his own jewelled dagger and
begging his permission to sell some jewels in Goa and his
influence with the Portuguese factor at Mangalore (in the
Ringdom of Kanara) io assist Akbar in chartering a ship
there to carry him to Arabia. Bul by order of the Emperor,
during March and April the Siddi lay witb his fleet in the
Rajapur creek, on the watch to intercept Akbar, if he took
ship at Goa

In September, Akbar remaved from Banda to Bicholim,
a town in Shambhuji’s territory, less than ten miles north of
Goa. Ulterly disgusted with Shambhuji, the poor deluded
Mughal prince, ai last (about 8th Nov.) bought a ship and
embarked at Vingurla, wishing to go io Persia, But
Kavi-kalash hurriedly arrived from Rajapur and with Durgadas


--- Page 306 ---
1583-35} REBELLIONS AGAINST SHAMBHUJT SOL

visited Akbar on board, and persuaded him to come back
to land with fresh promises of Shambhuji’s armed support in
Inclia. Then the Luso-Maratha war broke out, in which Akbar
acted as the mediator of the Marathas.

Akbar spent a whole year from February 1684 in the
Ratnagiri district (at Sakharpen and = Malkapur), inviting
Kavi-kalash repeatedly fo meet him and decide on future
nlans of action.

§ 11. Rebellions against Shambhuji ; Mughal
operations from Juls 1683.

From July 1685 the prospects of the imperialists in the
Deccan began to brighten. Akbar was estranged from
Shambhujfi ancl meditating flight from India. The Marathas
became plunged into a long war with the Portuguese. The
Mughals profited by these circumstances. The Emperor’s
indecision and cautious inactivity ended, and a_ vigorous
offensive was opened in many directions.

Shambhuji’s profligacy, capriciousness and violence created a
general discontent among his officers and vassals. Aurangzib’s
bribes aggravated the evil, and there were frequent desertions
from the Maratha service, On 26th July {685, Qazi Haidar,
Shivaji’s nuns6t, came over to Aurangzib and was created
a Qhazart and a Khan, and later on (1706) rose to be Chief
Qazi of the empire.

Khem Savant (ruler of Kudal and a vassal of Shambhuji)
rebelled against him and, reinforced by the Portuguese,
roamed over Savant-vadi, burning and robbing many places
in the Maratha kingdom north of Goa, (Feb. 1685). He with
two other rebels, named Dulva Nayak (of Phonda) and Ram
Dalvi, took refuge in Portuguese territory, made it a safe
base for their operations, and kept South Konkan and Kanara
in turmoil, The contagion spread. The whole coast region
was soon up in atms against Shambhuji.

The Mughal offensive was opened at the end of the rainy
season, about the middle of September, 1683. A few days
after 15th September, Shah Alam marched out of Aurangabad
with a grand army to penetrate into Savant-vadi and South
Konkan by the Ramghat pass, while Shihab-ud-din was sent
to Puna (Oct), from which he made a raid on Nizampur in
the Kolaba district across the Ghats (27 Dec.) Prince Azam,
who had been sent against Bijapuri territory (on 20th Ausust),
returned to Court in October and was transferred to Nasik
(Nov), to guard the northward road to Baglana and
Khandesh ; the Siddi cruised off Vingurla watching Akbatr’s
movements (Oct) ; the Emperor himself marched further south
to Ahmadnagar (Nev.); and another army corps (under Khan-
i-Jahan) was advanced from Bidar to Akalkot to watch the
Golkonda and Bijapur frontiers and prevent those Powers
from making any diversion in aid of the Marathas.

§ 19. Shafi Alam invades South Konkan,

From Aurangabad Shah Alam marched (Sep, 1685) due
south through Bijapuri territory, entered the Belgaum
district, and captured the fort of Shahpur, Sampgaon
(8 m s « of Belgaum) and some other large
cilies and a few forts of that region and much booty. Then
he turned sharply to the west, crossed the Ramghat pass
(26 m. due west of Belgaum and 30 miles north-east of Goa
as the crow flies) and descended into the plains of Savant-vacli,

Shah Alam reached Bicholim on 5th January, 1684, and
there demolished the spacious mansions and pleasure-gardens
of Shambhuji and Akbar. Three days afterwards a large
Mughal fleet rode into Goa harbour with provisions for the
ptince’s army.

On arriving near Goa, he demanded a huge fee from
ihe Portuguese for having saved them from being plundered
by Shambhu ! He also plotted to seize Goa by treachery.

1684] SHAH ALAM'S FAILURE IN RAMGHAT EXPEDITION 303

This rupture with lhe Portuguese was the worst mistake that
the prince could have committed, because it ultimately caused
the annihilation of his army through famine.

From the neighbourhood of Goa Shah Alam marched
northwards to Malvan and there blew up with gunpowder
the famous white temple and other edifices belonging to the
Maratha king. Kudal and Banda (in Savant-vadi) were burnt
and Vingurla sacked by him during this expedition. Turning
south again, he returned to the bank of the Chapora river,
(north of Goa), either to establish touch with his provision-
vessels or to make a second attempt on the Portuguese
capital.

In February the further progress of the Mughal army was
stopped by famine. Portuguese suspicion prevented the Mughal
provision fleet from sailing up the creek of Goa to the prince’s
camp ;no corn could be secured locally, and famine was raging
in Goa. The prinee’s only work in Konkan hac been, as the
English merchants remark, “to range to and fro, as he pleases,
with little resistance. He hath taken no stronghold but ruins
the country, lays all waste, and burns all towns he comes
near.” The scarcity in his camp reached an extreme point,
The soldiers through fasting retained only the fast breath of
their lives. So, the baffled prince returned to the gat on 20th
February.

His difficulties only thickened. In the narrow Ramghat
pass, the air bred a pestilence of such virulence that in a week
one-third of his men died, none escaping who was altacked.
The horses, elephants and camels perished in an even larger
proportion and their carcases poisoned the air, This failure of
transport led to a second famine. Many of his men also died
of the great heat and thirst they underwent.

Shah Alam crossed the pass and descended into the
Kanara plains. The enemy hovered round, cut off stragglers
and plundered the baggage and convoys “in all directions,”

The miserable remnant of his army reached Abtnadnagar on
18th May, without having done anything except burning a few
villages and robbing a few towns.

$15. Shambfuji’s doings attev 1683.

The minor operations of the years 1685-85 need not
be described here. The Mughal campaign in the first halt
of 1684 was highly successful; many Maratha forts
were taken, their field armies repeatedly defeated, and much
territory annexed. The crowning feat was the capture of
two wives, one daughter and three  slave-girls of Shambhuji,
who were confined in the fort of Bahadurgarh in July. One
wife and one sister of the Maratha king had been captured
before by Dilr Khan and lodged in Ahmadnagar fort.

Where was Shambhuji al! this time? After the failure o}
his attack on Goa at the end of 1683, he entirely gave
himself up to pleasure, spending his time with women, amuse-
ment, and wine, instead of taking the field and emulating the
example of valour and untiring exertion bequeathed to him by
his father.

Aboul the middle of January 1685, Shihab-ud-din Khan
made a fresh dash into Konkan by the Bhorghat and set fire
to the village (Pachad) at the foot of Raigarh fort, “slew many
of the infidel chiefs, plundered their wealth anc property,
made many captives and gained a great victory.” For his
brilliant success he was created Khan Bahadur Firuz Jang.

Many Maratha captains were induced by Firuz Jang to desert
fo the imperial side. Early in December Kondana was
captured by Abdul Qadir. While every Maratha soldier was
sorely needed for home defence, they made the mistake of
blindly following their policy of mulkegiri and raiding
Khandesh. But at the end of March 1685 the siege of
Bijapur began, the Mughal forces were concentrated there,
and the pressure upon the Marathas ceased for a time.

1687] MUGHAL CONQUESTS IN DECCAN 305

Captain Richard Keigzwin, who had selsecd the fort of
Bombay from the East India Company’s governor, adapted
a vigorous policy and, in April 1684, forced Siddi Qasim,
the Mughal admiral, to respect the neutrality of Bombay by
ceasing to make that island the base of his operations against
the Maratha villages. At the end of April he sent two
ambassadors (Capfain Henry Gary and Lt Thomas Wilkins)
with Ram Shenvi as interpreter, to Shambhuji, to settle the
long-standing differences about the indemnity claimed by the
English for Shivaji’s sack of their Rajapur factory in March
1661 and other matters and to make a friendly alliance with
the Maratha Rajah. The mission was a complefe success.
Shambhuji granted all the demands of the English and signed
two agreements with them containing 50 and 1! articles.

§ 14. Mughal conquest of i6e provinces of Bijapur.

After the surrender’ of Bijapur (12th Sep. 1686), Aurangetb
sent his generals to the different parts of the newly-annexed
country fo make a revenue settlement, maintain peace, and
take charge of the forts. But from next February to September
the Mughal forces were concenirated at the siege of Golkonda,
and it was only after the fall of that fort (@1st Sep. 1687)
that the imperialists could renew their activity in the provinces
of the old Adil-Shahi kingdom.

Their first campaign was directed against the Berad clan,
who ruled over the land situated in the fork between the
Krishna and the Bhima, with thefr capital at Sagar.
The terror of Mughal arms inspired by the fall of Bijapur
and Golkonda within one year, did the work. Pam Nayak, the
Berad chieftain submitted, gave up his fort (28th November),
and paid a visit to the Emperor on 27th December 1687, but
suddenly died after five days. His country was annexed.

Mughal enterprise was next directed towards the east and
the south of the two newly-conquered Deccani Sultanates.

506 SHORE HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cn XIV

Firuz Jang invaded the district of Karnul and the tort
of Adoni, south of the Tungabhadra, where Siddi Masaud
was now reigning in independence, On 6th August 1688,
Siddi Masaud was induced to capitulate ; his fort was occupied
and renamed Imtiag-garh, and he was enrolled in the Mughal
peerage as a 7~Aazarl.

Prince Azam captured the strong fort of Belgaum after
a siege (about March). In other directions, too, innumerable
forts were captured by the imperialists.

The Emperor left Haidarabad on 925th January 1688, and
arrived at Bijapur on 15th March. Here his attention was
taken up by the necessity of giving relief to the people who
had fallen into want through the ruin of the city and its
environs. The chief want of the citizens was the lack of
drinking-water, because the aqueducts were damaged during
the siege and the water suddenly dried up (probably from
this cause), Mukhlis Khan, the Mir Atish, was ordered to
cut a canal for conveying the water of the Krishna to the city.

A terrible epidemic broke out in the city of Bijapur and
the imperial camp, at the beginning of November, 1688. “First
a bubo appeared in the arm-pit and the corner of the thigh,
then high fever and unconsciousness supervened; medical
treatment produced no effect; few men lived beyond two
days, but most died in less) Among the victims were the
Emperor’s old wife Aurangabadi Mahal, Maharajah Jaswant’s
alleged son Muhammadi-Raj aged 13, Fagzil Khan the Sadar,
and many other grandees. The middle class and poor people,
both Hindu and Muhammadan, who died, cannot be counted,
but are conjectured to have been not less than a lakh. Firuz
Jang’s eyes were lost.”

The Emperor firmly set out on his campaign on 14th
December, 1688, and a week afterwards the fury of the
epidemic abated. He marched on to Akluj, 85 miles north
of Bijapur and halted.

PRINCE AKBAR LEAVES INDIA 307

8 15. Last efforts of Akbar in India.

Akbar made a dash into Mughal territory in June 1686,
after the Emperor had left Sholapur to join the siege of
Bijapur and Mughal Deccan was denuded of his forces. The
attempt, however, jailed, because the Emperor with his usual
foresight had left Murhamat Khan with a division to guard
Ahmadnagar, who fought a severe battle with Akbar near
Chakan, and defeated and repulsed him. The prince went
back to Shambhuji's dominions and made some futile attempts
fo break northwards to Surat through Mahuli and Jawhayr.

At last, with Zia-ud-din Muhammad (a former follower of
Shuja) and 45 retainers, Akbar embarked in a ship hired at
Rajapur (commanded by Bendal, an Englishman), and sailed
for Persia (in Feb, 1687), but was driven by stress of weather
to the port of Masgal. After some months’ detention
here he reached the Persian Court at Isfahan on 24th
January, 1688. After thus safely sending him out of India,
Durgadas returned to his home in Marwar.

§ 16. Jnternal condition of the Maratha kingdom and
Shambhuji’s doings, 1688-1687.

While Aurangzib was directing the full strength of his empire
against Bijapur and Golkonda, Shambhuji made no adequate
effort to meet the danger that threatened all the Deccani
Powers alike. His soldiers plundered places in the Mughal
ferriiory as a matter of routine, bul these raids did not
influence ihe military situation. Aurangzib disregarded such
pin-pricks. The Maratha king was not wise enough to follow
any large and well-thought-out plan for diverting the Mughals
from “the sieges of Bijapur and Golkonda sand averting their
fail; his Government was also hopelessly weakened by
rebellions among his vassals and plots among his courtiers,


--- Page 313 ---
508 SHORE HISTORY OF (WURANGZIB [cu, XIV

Within a few years of the accession of Shambhuji, nearly allt
the ministers and generals who had contributed ito the
glory of his father’s reign disappeared. His affairs in
the outlying parts of his dominions suffered from the lack
of competent agents on the spot. The evil was ageravated
by fresh conspiracies against the Ring, which were inevitably
followed by the execution or af feast imprisonment ot
more Maratha generals and ministers of leading positions.
The Madras Karnatak, a kingdom in itself, had practically
passed out of Shambhuji’s control and was ruled by _ his
brother-in-law Harji Mahadik with the title of Maharajah in
semi-independence.

The economic decay of the Maratha kingdom through
Shambhuji’s supine rule, the corruption of his officers, and
the disorder caused by the rebels, is graphically described in
the English factory records. “In former years there was a
quantity of pepper, about 1,500 fandi, il grew in and near
about Rajapur; but now grows not the tenth part since thai
place hath been in Shivajt’s hands; it is a miserable poor
town [now.|”

The causes of this ruin of trade and industry were misrule
and the universal hunger for bribes and presents among the
Maratha State officials. “With the Rajah down to the Plowman
the infection of pesfikashing is so prevalent thal nothing can
be well done without tt, ot withstand tt.” The weavers that
used to come from Thanah and Chaul to Bombay were
about 600 families. But within a year of the Maratha sicge of
Chaul (1683), 400 of these families for want of encouragement
forsook Bombay, 150 of the remainder were dead; so that
only 50 families were left in 1685.

Near Karwar the ways were molested by Shambhuji’s
revolted vassals. “In his dominions there is little or no safety,
and at best a great deal of hazard: trade in general
obstructed.”

1688] SHAMBHUJY’S LAST ACTS 309

S17. Capture and execution of Shambhuyi.

After the conspiracies against Shambhuji in June 1680
and October 1681 had been crushed, there was a fresh plot
in October 1684, in consequence of which he threw several
leading men into prison, where they remained confined till
his death. Things then continued quiet at his Court for four
years. But in October 1688, the Shirké family again rose
against him; they attacked Kavi-kalash and drove him
into Khelna for refuge. Shambhuji marched from Raigarh
to the rescue of his favourite, defeated and routed the
rebels at Sangameshwar, and then went to Khelna. He
arrested Drahlad Niraji and . many other ministers and leading
people on suspicion of complicity in the late rising, and after
provisioning Khelna fort, started with Kavi-kalash for return-
ing to his capital, On the way he arrived at Sangameshwat,
29 miles ne. of Ratnagiti city, and the sacred junction of
the Alak-nanda and Varuna rivers, where Kavi-kalash had
laid out fine gardens and built nicely-cecorated mansions for
his master. Here, after sending his army and family back
to Raigarh, Shambhuji plunged into. drinking and merry-
making, with a small escort and in utter carelessness. All
vigilance was abandoned, as he believed the place to be
' impenetrable to Mughal arms.

Shaikh Nizam, “chief among the servants of Qutb Shah,”
had been induced to desert to the Mughals during the siege
of Golkonda (28th May, 1687) and created a 6-Aazari with
the title of Mugarrab Khan. This able and active general
had been detached to lay siege to Panhala (1688).

On hearing from his spies of Shambhuji’s unguarded life
of debauchery at Sangameshwar, he lost no ume. Taking
with himself only 2,000 picked troopers and 1,000 infantry,
he made a forced march from his camp at Kolhapur. Very
great hardship was undergone in crossing the jungles, broken

310 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB fou. XIV

ground and lofty passes of the Western Ghats, al such a
rapid pace. With only 300 troopers he arrived at Sangamesh-
wat “with the speed of lightning and wind,’ covering the
intervening 90 miles in two or three days.

When the invaders entered the town, Kavi-ralash offered
them battie. He was wounded by an = arrow in his right
hand, and being unable to fight, dismounted. The Maratha
force that had been hurriedly armed and assembled, being
now without a leader, broke and fled. Shambhuji and _ his
minister then hid themselves in a hole in the floor of the
latier’s house, but were dragged out by their long hair, and
taken fo the general on his elephant outside. Twenty-
five of Shambhuji’s chief followers with their wives and
daughters were captured at this place, (ist February 1689).

The news of the capture soon reached the imperial camp
at Akluj and caused a wild outburst of rejoicing in all parts
of the imperial dominions.

On {5th February the imperial camp reached Bahadurgarh,
when the captives were brought there. By the Emperor's
order, the oppressor of the Deccan was made a mark of
public ridicule. Four miles outside the encampment, Sham-
bhuji and Kavi-kalash were dressed as butioons with long
fool’s caps and bells placed on their heads, mounted on
camels, and brought to Bahadurgarh with drums beating and
trumpets pealing. Hundreds of thousands of spectators fined
the roads, to gaze at Shambhuji as at a new kind of wild
beast or demon. Thus degraded, the captives were slowly
paraded through the entire camp and finally brought fo the
Emperor who was sitting in full darbar for the occasion,
At the sight of the prisoner, Aurangzib descended from
his throne and kneeling down on the carpet bowed his head
to the ground in double thankfulness to the Giver of this
erowning victory." The Emperor's counsellors wanted to spare

* K. K. (388) narrates a tradition that when Aurangzib was thus praying, Kavi-

Shambhuji’s life and thus induce him fo order his officers fo
surrender all his forts peacefully. Ruhullah Khan was sent bv
Aurangzib to learn from Shambhuji where he kept his treasures
hicden and which of the imperial officers used fo correspond
with him. Fretting with bitterness of soul at being publicly
insulted and now driven to despair, Shambhuji spurned at the
offer of life, loosened his tongue in abuse of the Emperor and
his Prophet, and scurriloustly asked for one of Aurangzib’s
daughters to be given to him as the price of his friendship.

The Maratha Rajah had sinned beyond hope of pardon.
That very night his eyes were blinded and next day the tongue
of Kavi-kalash was cut out The Muhammadan theologians
pronounced a decree that Shambhuji should be put to death
on account of his having “slain, captured and dishonoured
Muslims and plundered the cities of Islam.” The Emperor
consented to his death. After undergoing a fortnight of torture
and insult, the captives were removed with the imperial camp
to Koregaon, on the bank of the Bhima, 12 m.n.e. of Puna,
(on 3rd March), and there they were put toa cruel and
painful death on {ith March, their limbs being hacked off one
by one, and their flesh thrown to the dogs. Their severed
heads were stuffed with straw and exhibited in all the chief
cities of the Deccan to the accompaniment of dium and
trumpet.

After the downfall of Shambhuji his younger brother

kalash addressed imprompty Ilindi ‘verses to Shambhuji saying, “O Rajah! even
Aurangzib dare not sit on the throne in thy presence, but must kneel to do thee

was too young to be the head of a State engaged in a life

afterwards an imperial army under Itiqad Khan laid siege to

the new subahdar of Bijapur, tried to intercept the fugitives,
and came up with them in three days “near the forts of
Subhangarh and Jara on the bank of the Tungabhadra.” The
Marathas who had taken refuge in an island, were atlacked
at night and'a hundred of their chiefs were made prisoner.
But Rajaram contrived to escape with his bare life while his
comrades were carrying on the fight

For some time he hid himself in the territory of the Rani
of Bednur (now the Shimoga district of Mysore). But at fast
she fet him escape to Jinji (where he arrived on Ist Nov),
and then made her peace with the Emperor by paying a
small fine. The Maratha captives taken on the island were
confined in the citadel of Bijapur, but in a short time Hindu
Rao, Baharji, and some twenty other chiefs escaped from lhe
stronghold,—-a_ feat “which was impossible except with the
connivance of their guards.’ At this the Emperor put the
remaining 80 prisoners to death.

a long struggle captured the fort of Raigarh on 19th October
1689, anct seized in it Shivaji’s surviving widows, and Sham-
bhuji’s and Rajaram’s wives, daughters anc sons, including
Shahu, a boy of seven. The ladies were lodged in separate
tents with every respect and privacy. Shahu was given the
rank of a 7-hazari and the title of Rajah, but kept a prisoner
near the imperial tent. %

Thus, by the end of the year 1689, Aurangzib was the
unrivalled lord paramount of Northern India and the Deccan
alike. Adil Shah, Qutb Shah, and Rajah Shambhuji had all
fallen and their dominions had been annexed to his empire.

( “All seemed to have been gained by Aurangzib now ;
but in reality all was lost. It was the beginning of his end.
The Mughal empire had become too large to be ruled by one
man or from one centre....His enemies rose on all sices ;
he could defeat but not crush them for ever. Lawlessness
reigned in many parts of Northern and Central India. The
administration grew slack and corrupt. The endless war in
the Deccan exhausted his treasury. Napoleon |. used fo say,
‘It was the Spanish ulcer which ruined me.’ The Deccan ulcer

CHAPTER XV
STRUGGLE WITH THE MARATHAS UP TO 1700.

§ 1. Aucangzib’s movements ducing the second half
of Als reign.

Leaving Rajputana on 8th September (681, Aurangzib
reached Aurangabad on the 92nd March following and
occupied ihis strategic centre, direcling the operations of his
columns in all directions, till 13th November 1683, when he
proceeded further south to Ahmadnagar. From this place he
arrived at Sholapur on 24th May [685 so as to be still closer
to Bijapur, which his troops had besieged. Ue went to the
Rasulpur suburb of Bijapur on 3rd July 1686 in order to press
the siege fo a conclusion. Leaving the newly conquered
Adil-Shahi capital on 50th October, he visited Kulbarga and
Bidar and then sat down before Golkonda on 28th January
1687, Here he lay encamped for a year, and then arrived
at Bijapur fon his second visil) on 15th March 1688. — [n this
city he lived for the next nine months, till driven out (on 14th
December) by a terrible outbreak of the plague. By way of
Akluj and Bahadurgarh (on the Bhima) he reached Koregaon
in the Puna district, where he encatnped from Srd+ March ito
{8th December 1689, and then returned to Bijapur (on 11th
Jan. 1690). But he soon left it, and after spending February,
March and April at different places south of that city, near
the bank of the Krishna, he finally encamped at Galgala, on


--- Page 320 ---
1690-1706] AURANGZIB’S MOVEMENTS 313

the southern side of that river and 34 miles south-west of
Bijapur, about @{st May 1690. The rest of this year and the
first two months of the next year were pagsed by him here ;
and then he went back to the environs of Bijapur for fourteen
months (March {69{—May 1699}. Thereafter, Galgala was
again his residence, for nearly three years (May 1692—~
March 1695),

Finally, after a fifth and last visit to Bijapur for five weels
(April—May 1695), he settled at Brahmapuri on the southern
bank of the Bhima, which he renamed Jsfampuri. Here he
lived for four years and a half (Q1 May 1695—19 Oct. 1699).
At Islampuri his encampment was walled round, and here
he left his family in charge of his wazir when he set out on
19th October, (699, on that endless campaign against the
Maratha forts which was to wear out the last years of his life,
and from which he returned to Ahmadnagar (20 Jan. 1706),
only to die a year later (@0 Feb, {707).

$2 The Maratha recovery, 1690~93.

The years 1688 and 1689 were a period of
unbroken triumph to the Emperor. His armies took possession
of the forts and provinces of the annexed kingdoms of Bijapur
and Golkonda, eg. Sagar (the Berad capital), Raichur and
Adoni (in the east), Sera and Bangalore (in Mysore), Wandli-
wash and Conjeveram (in the Madras Karnatak), Bankapur
and Belgaum (in the extreme south-west), besides Raigarh {the
eapital) and many other Maratha forts. In Northern India,
too, signal success attended his arms: the Jat rising under
Rajaram was put down and that leader was slain (on 4th
July, 1688).

But at the end of 1689 the new Maratha king Rajaram
was known to have reached the fort of Jinji, which henceforth
became a centre of Maratha enterprise in the East Coast,

16 SHORT INSTORY OF AURANGZIB [cu. XV

while their ministers left at home organized resistance to
the Mughals in the west. The difficulties of Aurangzib were
only multiplied by the disappearance of a common head and
a central Government among the Marathas, as every Maratha
captain with his own retainers fought and raided in a different
quarter and on his own account It now became a people’s
war, and Aurangzib could not end it, because there was no
Maratha Government or State-army for him to attack and
destroy. The imperial forces could not be present every-
where in full strength; hence, they suffered reverses here
and there. The enemy forts which the Mughals had captured
er bought during the first panic following Shambhuji's down-
fall, now began to be recovered by the Marathas. The tide
first turned againsl Aurangzib in May 1690, when his general
Rusiam Khan was captured and his whole camp footed by
the Marathas.

Throughout 1690 and 1691 the Emperor’s chief concern
still was to lake possession of the almost boundless expanse
of fertile territory in the south and the east, which had legally
fallen to him as the heir-at-law of Adil Shah and Qutb
Shah. At this stage, he evidently underrated the Maratha
danger, as he felt that the State of the Marathas had been
practically annihilated. Ile had yet to fake a proper measure
of the Maratha people.

In the autumn of 1691 the Mughal position before Jinji
became so dangerous that the Emperor had to — divert
large forces to that quarter. In {692 nothing was
achieved by the imperialists in the western theatre, whilc
in the east coast the year ended with crushing disasters to
their arms,—the capture of two high Mughal generals, the
abandonment of the siege lines before Jinji, and the arrest
of Prince Kam Bakhsh by his colleagues (Dec, 1699-—TJan.
1693). So, the first thing fo be done in 1693 was to save
the situation by pouring reinforcements and supplies into the

Eastern Karnatak. In the western theatre, Prince Muize-ud-din,
who had laid siege to DPanhala in October 1699, toiled
unsuccessfully throughout the next year, and was finally
expelled by the Marathas in March (694, In addition
to this, there were the incessant raids of the Maratha
partisan leaders,—Santa Ghorparé, Dhana Jadav, Nima Sindhia,
Hanumant Rao and others.

Meantime, over the broad and strategically important tract
from Bidar lo Bijapur and from Raichur to Malkhed, the
activities of the hardy aboriginal tribe of Berads led by their
enterprising chief Pidia Nayak, had become so serious that
a large army under a first-rate general had to be posted at
Sagar from June 1691 to December 1699. Then the Berad
chieftain made his submission, but he renewed his hostility
three years later, when another large army had to be sent
against him (1696). During 1694 the war in Western Deccan
continued to be of the same indecisive and straggling character.
Only in the Madras Karnatak the reinforced Mughal general
made many conquests and levied contribution from Tanjore,
bul Jinji remained uncaptured.

At last, by April 1695 Aurangzib came to realize that he
had really gained nothing by the conquest of the Adil-Shahi
and Qutb-Shahi capitals and the extinction of their royal
lines. He now perceived that the Maratha problem was no
fonger what it had been in Shivaji’s time, or even in
Shambhuji’s, They were no longer a tribe of bandlitti or local
rebels, but the one dominating factor of Deccan politics, the

the Deccan and even in Malwa, the Central Provinces
and Bundelkhand.

For Aurangzib, then, there was no going back to Delhi; his
work in the Deecan was still unfinished; indeed, it was only

just beginning.

$3. The Emperor's stay at [slamputt, 1695-1699.

Therefore, in May [695 he sent his eldest surviving son
Shah Alam to govern the north-western portion of the empire
(the Panjab, Sindh, and afterwards Afghanistan) and to guard
the western gateway of India, while he himself settled at
Islampuri for the next 4!/2 years, and thereafier made it the
base (bungaf) at the back of his campaigns. During the
\slampuri period (1695-1699), the Maratha danger came nearer
home and drove the Mughals into lhe defensive in the Marathi
and Kanarese districts of the present Bombay Presidency,
The movements of their roving bands were bewilderingly rapid
and unexpected. The Mughals could not defend every place ;
their pursuing columns panted helplessly behind the “robbers”
and wore themselves out in vain. Local representatives of the
Emperor were driven to make unauthorized terms with the
Marathas by promising them an annual blackmail of one-fourth
of the revenue (chauff). Worse than these, many imperialists
made a concert with the enemy and = enriched them-
selves by robbing the Emperor’s own subjects and innocent
traders, as these officers had been slarving at gelting no rent
from {heir devastated fiefs. The Mughal administration had
really dissolved, and only the presence of the Emperor with
all his troops in the country held it together, but it was now
a delusive phantom.

The chief incidents of this Islampuri period were Santa's
destruction of two great Mughal generals, Qasim Khan (Nov.
1695} and Himmat Khan (Jan. 1696), the murder of Sania in
a domestic feud Gune 1697), the Mughal capture of Jinji (7

Jan. 1698), and the consequent return af Rajaram to
Maharashira,

8 4. Aurangsib’s last campaigns, 1699~1705.

This last event forced a change on Aurangzib’s policy. Safe
in the undisputed possession of the east coast, he could now
concentrate al] his resources in the western theatre of war.
Now, therefore, began the Jast stage of Aurangzib’s career—
the sieges of successive Maratha forts by the Emperor in
person. The rest of his life (1699-1707) is a repetilion of the
same sickening tale : a hill-fori captured by him after a vast
expenditure of time men and money, the fort recovered by
the Marathas from the weak Mughal garrison after a few
months, and its siege begun again by the Mughals a year or
two Jater! His soldiers and camp-followers suffered unspeak-
able hardships in marching over flooded rivers, muddy roads,
and broken hilly tracks; porters disappeared ; transport beasts
died of hunger and overwork; scarcity of grain was ever
present in his camp. His officers wearied of this labour of
Sisyphus; but Aurangzib would burst into wrath at any
suggestion of return fo Northern India and taunt the unlucky
counsellor with cowardice and love of ease. The mutual
jealousies of his generals ruined his affairs as completely as
the Trench cause in the Peninsular War was ruined by the
jealousies of Napolean’s marshals. Therefore, the Emperor
must conduct every operation in person, or nothing would
be done. The siege of eight forts-~Satara, Parli, Panhala,
Kheina, Kondana, Raigarh, Torna and Wagingera,—occupied
him for five years and a half (1699-1705).

The siege of Wagingera (8 Feb.—97 April 1705} was the
last campaign of the old campaigner of eighty-eight. At
Devapur, where he halted (May—Oct. 1705) after the capture
of this fort, a severe illness seized him. The whole camp
was thrown into despair and confusion. At lengih Aurangzib

yielded to their entreaty and the warning ot approaching
death, and retreated fo Ahmadnagar (20 January 1706), to
die there a year afterwards

85 Sorrow and misery of fis last xears.

The last few years of his life were inexpressibly sad. On
its public side there was the consciousness that his long
reien of half a century had been a colossal failure. The end-
less war in the Deccan exhausted his treasury; the Govern-
ment turned bankrupt; the soldiers starving from arrears
of pay (usually three years overdue) miutinied ; and during
the closing years of his reign the revenue of Bengal, regularly
senl by the honest and able dfwan Murshid Quli Khan, was
the sole support of the Emperor’s household and army, and
its arrival was eagerly looked forward fo. Whife in the
Decean the Marathas remained supreme to the end, lawlessness
reigned in many places of Northern and Central India also.
The old Emperor in the far South lost control over his
officers in Hindustan, and the administration grew slack and
corrupt; chiefs and zamindats defiecl the local authorities and
asserted themselves, filling the country with tumult, and the
great anatchy in the empire of Delhi began even before
Aurangzib had closed his eyes.

In the Deccan, the Maratha caplains, each acting on hig
own account, incessantly raided Mughal territory and dic‘ the
greatest. possible injury to the imperialists by their guerilla
wariare. They seemed io be ubiquitous and elusive like the
wind. The movable columns frequently sent out from lhe
imperial headquarters to “chastise the robbers,” only marched
and counter-marched, without being able to crush lhe enemy.
When the Mughal forces had gone back, the scattered Marathas®
like water parted by the oar, closed again and resumed their
attack as before. There was an exultant and menacing

1689] LEADERS OF KINGLESS MARATHA PEOPLE 324

Maratha army always hanging three or four miles behind the
Emperor's camp wherever it marched or halted.

The wastage of the Deccan war, which raged intensely
for nearly 20 years, was one hundred thousand soldiers and
followers ancl three times that number of horses, elephanis,
camels and oxen on the Mughal side every year. In the
imperial camp pestilence was always present and the daily
mortality was heavy. The economic exhaustion of the Deccan
was complete; “the fields were left devoid of trees and bare
of crops, their places being taken by the bones of men and
beasts. The country was so entirely desolated and depopula-
ted that neither fire nor light could be found in the course
of a three or four days’ journey.” (Manucci).

86. The leading Maratfia ministers and generals
at the accession of Rajaram.

In the ferrible national crisis when Shambhuji’s sons were
captured and his successor Rajaram was driven into hopeless
flight by the Mughals, the genius of the Maratha people saved
them and secured their liberty. [t is, therefore, necessary fo
study the leaders of this almost kingless State during the
period, At this time (end of 1689), the leading persons in
the Maratha State were four: Nilkantha Moreshwar Pinglé
the Pesfwa, Ramchandra Nilkantha Bavdékar the Ama/ya,
Shankaraji Malhar the SacHiv, and Prahlad, the son of the
late Chief Justice Niraji Ravi. This Prahlad had been
Maratha ambassador at Golkonda. Three other men, who
had hitherto filled only subordinate posts, now forced their
way by their genius and enterprise to the first rank of State
servants and popular leaders in this crisis of Maratha history.
They were Dhana Singh Jaday and Santaji Ghorparé (the
two rivals for the office of Senapati), and Parashuram
Trimbak, who finally rose fo the post of Pratinidft or Regent
in 1701. .

599 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB (cu. XV

The able general Zultiqar Khan invested the Maratha
capital of Raigarh in February 1689. But before its fall
(on 19th October) Rajaram, the newly enthroned successor
of the murdered Shambhuji, slipped out of the fort in the
disguise of a Hindu religious beggar (yogi) on Sth April and
went to Panhala. Ramchandra advised him that it would be a
wise strategy to divide the enemy's forces by transferring a
part of the Maratha activities fo the far off Eastern Karnatak,
while the Mughals were kep! in play on the western
side of the peninsula by his other officers.

The plan of operations for the future was thus arranged ;
Rajaram was to be escorted to finji to make a stand in his
eastern province. The supreme control of affairs in the
homeland was vested in Ramchandra N. Bavdékar, the
Amatga, who was given the. new litle of Hakumat-panafi or
Diclator, with his heaclquarters first in Vishalgarh and latterly
in Parli, assisted by Shankaraji Malhar (the Sec&iv) and
eertain other officers. All officials and captains in the
homeland were to fake their orders from Ramchandra and
obey him like the king himself. Ramchandra had an inborn
genius for command and organization. Ile gathered round
himself the ablest fieutenanis, and managed to make the
mutually jealous and contentious Maratha guerilla leaders
act in concert

Arriving at Jinji on Ist November 1689, Rajaram took over
the government from the unwilling hands of Harji Mahadik’s
widew and son, formed a full Court and began to teign like a
king, though in extreme poverty. The Peshwa Nilkantha M.
Pingle accompanied his master to Jinji, but there fell completely
into the second place ; the king’s leading counsellor and the
supreme authority tn the administration was Prahlad Niraji, on
whom the high title of Regent (Pratinidfii) was conferred and
who thus stood outside and above the cabinet of eight
ministers (Ashta-Pradfan).

8 7. Aurangzib’s successes and Rolicy during 1689.

When Rajaram fled from Maharashtra, Aurangsib had
already won many of the Maratha forts and was rapidly
winning others by money or force. In the extreme north,
Salhir (21 Feb. 1687) and Trimbak (8 Jan. 1689) had been
captured, and in the centre Singhgarh (Nov. 1684) and Rajgarh
(May 1689); Raigarh and Panhala were to fall before the year
was over, while in North Konkan his able agent Matabar Khan
gained many places. The inland parts of Central and Southern
Konkan remained in Maratha possession, but the coast was
mostly subject to Mughal sway, as the Marathas were forced
to lose the port of Chaul, evacuate the island-depat of Underi,
and transfer their naval headquarters further south to Gheria
or Vijaydurs.

In the year 1689 many Maratha forts fell easily into
Aurangzib’s hands. His one aim now was to occupy the
rich and boundless dominions of the fallen Adil-Shahi and
Qutb-Shahi kingcloms. Therefore, during 1689, 1690 and
1691 Aurangzib was too busy in the plains of the south
and the east to divert his resources to the barren hill-forts
of the west.

8 8. Maratha recovery : capture of Rustam Khan,
Mag 1690; stege of Panhata.

But, in 1690, the Marathas began to show signs of recovery
from the effects of the disastrous fall of their late king, On
25th May 1690 they gained their first signal victory. The
Mughal general Rustam Khan was roving in the neighbour-
hood of Satara with his family and troops, planning how
to capture that fort for the Emperor. The Maratha leaders,—
Ramchandra, Shankaraji, Santa, and Dhana,—fell upon him
in concert. Rustam himself, after receiving many wounds,
fell down from his elephant and was carried off into


--- Page 329 ---
304 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB lon. XV

captivity. Fifteen hundred of the Mughals fell on the field.
The Maratha general in Satara fort now sallied out -and
carried off the family of Rustam Khan into the fort. [n
addition, the Marathas made prize of 4,000 horses, eight
elephants and the entire camp and baggage of Rustam’s
army. After sixteen days, Rustam Khan ransomed
himself by promising to pay one lakh of Rupees. Next .
Ramchandra and Shankaraji recovered the great forts of
Pratapgarh, Rohira, Rajgarh and Torna, in the course of the
same year (1690), After the fall of Raigarh, the Maratha
garrison of Panhala lost heart and sold the fort to the
imperialists (about December). But the Mughal garrison held
i#t so negligently that the Marathas under Parashuram
afterwards easily recovered it by surprise (about the middle
of 1699),

Prince Muizz-ud-din laid siege to Panhala in October
1692 and sat down before it till 1694 without success. In
Oct. 1693, Dhana Jadav arrived there and effectively spoiled
the work done by Muizz-ud-din in a year outside Panhala,
reprovisioned the fort, and destroyed ihe siege-works. There-
after the siege was practically abandoned ; the prince carried
on his operations languidly, merely to deceive the Emperor.

In March 1694 the prince, availing himself of the Emperor's
permission, began fo march away from Panhala, while Luifullah
Khan and many other officers, who had positive orders to
stay below the fort, joined him in the. retreat. Then Biclar
Bakhi (the eldest son of Prince Md. Azam) was given this
task and set out from the Court at Galgala on Sth April.

A desultory siege was continued by him till the end of
January 1696, when the disasters to Qasiin Khan and Himmat
Khan further south induced the Emperor to send the prince
to Basavapatan, and to entrust the siege of Panhala to Firuz
Jang, who, too, could effect nothing. In fact, the capture of
Panhala was quite beyond the power of any divisional army.


--- Page 330 ---
1699] DHANA AND SANTA’S ACTIVITIES 395

After the disaster to Rustam Khan (May 1690), the Emperor
found it necessary to occupy the North Satara district in force.
Lutfullah Khan was detached from Court as thanadar of
Khaiau (25 m.e. of Satara). On 6th July, fowards the
end of one night, Santa Ghorpare at the head of ten thousand
horse and numberless infantry surprised him; the camp was
saved from plunder by firing from a distance, But the Marathas
were only baffled and not crushed. They rallied their forces
and reappeared in the East Satara region in superior force.
Lutfullah was attacked, but beat the enemy back, though
with: loss.

There was nothing further to note till the end of 1690,
when some Maratha auxiliaries of the Mughals,—namely Nima
Sindhia, Mankoji Pandhré and Nagoji Mané—went over to
Rajaram at Jinji with their contingents.

The year 1692 witnessed a renewal of Maratha activity and
their conspicuous success in many quarters, one of these being
their recovery of Panhala from Mughal hands. Santaji Ghor-
pare’s base was the Mahadev hill to the north-east of Satara,
and from this refuge he used to make rapid raids far to the
east, over the rolling plains of Bijapur. At the same time the
Marathas were disturbing the Belgaon and Dharwar districts of
the Western Kanara. On 8th October, Dhana and Sania
with 7,000 men were reported to have seized some forts near
Belgaon and invested the latter town itself, and to be feeding
their horses on the growing crops. The Emperor stiffened the
defence of Kanara, by sending Hatnid-ud-din Khan to Belgaon
and Matlab Khan te Dharwar, while Qasim Khan the faujdar of
Bijapuri Karnatak or north-west Mysore, was reinforced and
ordered to guard Bankapur and other places near if. In Decem-~
ber both Santa and Dhana went to Madras with large
armies to relieve Jinji, and therefore Maharashtra was for a
time denuded of the best national leaders and troops, and the
Mughals in the western theatre enjoyed peace for a time.

89. Steuggle wilh Santaji Ghorpare and Dhana _ Jadav,
1695-94,

Late in 1693 Maratha activities revived’ in the west. Amrit
Rao Nimbalkar crossed the Bhima fo raid Mughal territory.
Himmat Khan set out in pursuit of him, but could nol catch the
elusive Maratha horsemen. At the same time Dhana, Shankaraji
and other leaders were attacking the Mughal force before Pan-
hala. Santa Ghorpare had come back from Jinji, and in Oclober
1693 he resumed his raids in the homeland. Timmat [han
went out in pursuit and gained a signal viclory over Santa and
his Berad allies (about 14th Nov.) at the village of Vikramhalli.
Then the Mughal generals quarrelled ; Hamid-ud-din and Khwaja
Khan gave up the pursuit and returned towards Kulbarga, leav-
ing Himmat alone to follow the enemy. Santa now - safely
clivided his force, detaching 4,000 troopers under Amrit Rao to
raid Berar, while he himself marched with 6,000 horsemen to-
wards Malkhed, collecting chautf. Desullory fighting with
many fruitless marches followed for many months and the
Mughals could achieve nothing substantial.

Throughout 1694 and 1695, though the Maratha bands were
active and the Berads troublesome all over the Western Deccan,
nothing decisive or noteworthy was done on either side til
the end of 1695, when Sanla defeated and killed two _ first-rate
Mughal generals, Qasim Khan and Himmat Khan.

Such was the chequered history of the contest with the
Marathas in Western India fill near the enc! of the year 1695,
it was no longer a simple military problem, but had become a
trial of endurance and resources between the Mughal empire
and the indigenous people of the Deccan.

§ 10. The Eastern Karnatak, its divisions and Bistory.

The Eastern or Madras Karnatak, which must be distinguished
from the Western Karnatak or the Kanarese-speaking division

1687] EASTERN KARNATAK, ITS HISTORY 5Q7

of the Bombay Presidency (called Kanara in this book ),—~ex-
fends from near the 15th degree of north latitude to the Kaveri
river in the south. In the late 17th century it was divided in-
io two halves by the Dalar river, or an imaginary line from
Vellore to Sadras. These two parts were called Haidarabacti
Karnatakk and Bijapuri Karnatak respectively, and each of them
was further sub-divided into uplands ( dalagfat, in Persian )
and plains (payinghat). The upland of Haidarabadi Karnatak
included Sidhoul, Gandikota, Guti, Garamkonda and Kadapa;
Bijapuri Balaghat included the Sera and Bangalore districts
of Mysore and their dependent zamindaris. In the lowlands,
Haidarabadi Karnatak embraced the sea-coast from Gantur to
Sadras ; Biapuri Payinghat extended south from Sadras (1250
degree of north latitude) to Tanjore. But the conquests had
not becn consolidated; much of the country was still in the
hands of unsubdued poligars or petty local chieftains, and
Adi! Shah only held certain forts and their environs ; but
even fn these his authority was exercised by his nobles, who
were independent in all but the name. This situation was
further complicated by Shivaji’s invasion and conquest of the
country (1677-78), as the result of which a new Maratha
Government was created in the South Arcot district (capital,
lini). Shivaji had placed Raghunath Narayan Hanumanté as
viceroy over this new conquest. Shambhuji, soon after his
accession, dismissed and imprisoned Raghunath (early in
January 1684), and sent his own sister’s husband Hatji Mahadik
to govern finji, But the Maratha kine’s absorption in vice,
and the increasing Mughal pressure on Maharashtra under
the personal direction of Aurangzib, fended to extinguish
Shambhuji’s authority in the far off province of Jinji and to
make the local viceroy his own master. Harji assumed the
fitle of Maharajah, and neglected to send the surplus revenue
to his sovereign at Raigarh,

In. October 1686 Shambhuji sent Kesho Trimbak Pingle

398 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cu. XV

with [2,000 horse, outwardly to strengthen his garrisons in
the Karnatak, but with secret instructions to seize and depose
the refractory Harfi Rajal and assume the government of Jinji
in the king’s name. Kesho Trimbak arrived near Jinji
on {1th February 1687. But his hopes were doomed
to disappointment. Harji had effectually secured Jinji fort
in his own hands and made the local army absolutely
devoted to himself. Kesho, finding the game lost, marched
into Mysore at the head of 18,000 horse. But here he could
effect nothing, and soon returned to the neighbourhood of
Jinji.

§ 11. Mughal penetration into the Eastern
Kacnatak, 1687.

After the conquest of Golkonda Aurangzib wisely retained
the former Qutb-Shahi officers at their respective posts for
some time. Muhammad Ibrahim (created by him Mahabat
Khan), the highest Golkonda noble to desert to him, was
appointed subahdar of Haidarabad, and the Khan’s confidant
Muhammad Ali Bes (now entitled Ali Askar Khan) was
nominated faujdar of the Qutb-Shahi Karnatak,
with subordinate qiladars and magistrates at Chinglepal,
Conjeveram and Punamali. These officers submissively
proclaimed Aurangzib as their sovereign, (October {687)."
Bul the Emperor changed his mind soon afterwards;
Mahabat Khan was replaced by Ruhullah Khan in the
stibahdari of Haidarabad: Qasim Khan supplanted Ali Askar
and was directed to march to the Karnatak and conduct a
vigorous war against the Maratha forces there (January, 1688).

Harji sent out a detachtnent of his army to plunder
and conquer on his own account the late territory of

ae

* “The governor of Punamali said that as the world lurned round like vo

mighty Alamgit had gained over his old master.” (Osme’s Féag, 187.)

1687-88] RIVAL ARMIES IN E, KARNATAK 529

Golkonda north of the Palar river, which had recently
submitted to Mughal ownership without having as yer
received adequate Mughal garrisons. Marching with 2,000
horse, 3,000 foot, and great numbers of pioneers and sealing
ladders, he took easy possession of several forts
and a hundred towns in this region, On 4th December
Arcot was captured by assault. The Marathas spread over
the country plundering and torturing without regard for sex
or creed. Several great Brahmans of Conjeveram with their
wives and children took refuge in Madras (97th. Dee.
1687—10th Jan. 1688), to save their persons and properiy
from Maratha outrage. On 1ith Jan. the Marathas burst into
Conjeveram plundering the city, killing about 500 men,
destroying the houses, and putting the terror-stricken inhabitants
to flight. Kesho Trimbak took to the same profitable business
with his own contingent : after capturing Chitpat and Kaveripak,
he established his camp at Conjeveram, (January 1688).

But the Maratha occupation was shortlived. Aurangzib
had ordered four high generals of the late Golkonda
Government—Ismail Khan Maka, Yachapa Nayak, Rustam
Khan, and Muhammad Sadig,—to haslen to the Karnatak
plains and succow the Emperor's partisans there. These
officers arrived at Conjeveram on 95th February 1688. The
Marathas evacuated that town; the Mughal vanguard pursued
and fought them, seized Wandiwash and mace it their camp,
while the Marathas encamped at Chitpal, a day’s march
southwards. The main armies on the two sides remained
in this position fora year, merely watching each other,
but they daily sent out detachments and foraging parties
who plundered the country indiscriminately. The hapless
people, wha had not yet recovered from the effects of the
desolating famine of 1686, had now fo endure two sets of
robbers instead of one. The trade of the district was ruined,
industry ceased, grain and oil seeds became very scarce,

fat

and multitudes flocked to the fortified European settlements on
the coast as their only refuge.

The year 1689 continued to be as bad for the Karnatak
as the year before. The roads were unsafe ; Mughal and
Maratha armies daily plundered the country. Country-made
cotton and other goods could not be brought to the English
factory al Kunimedu for expart, by reason of the constant
warfare and robbery in the region.  Harji died about 19th
Sept. Uis wife Ambika Bai (Shivaji’s daughter) continued to
govern the fort and province on behalf of her minor sons.

§ 12 Rajaram at Jinjt.

But the arrival of Rajaram at Jinji ({ Now. 1689) was
followed by a peaceful revolution. [arji’s widow and her
Brahman advisers were reluctant to part with the usurped
authority and local independence they had enjoyed for over
eight years. [Memoirs of F, Martin). But Rajaram’s right
could not be disputed: the government of Jinji passed into
his hands. Harji’s son was placect under confinement, and
money was squeezed out of the late viceroy’s widow by
calling upon her to render accounts for her husband’s long
years of administration of the province, She had to make
her peace by paying three lakhs of Aun, and Santaji Bhonsle
one Jakh. For Prahlad Niraji, the king’s supreme agent, a
new posi, that of Pratinidfii or Regent, was created, vehile
Nilo Moreshwar Pinglé continued to hold the title of Pesfira
or nominal prime minister. The Regent, Prahlad Niraji, “threw
Rajaram into a life of debauchery” and kept “the young king
constantly intoxicated by the habitual use of ganja and opium.”
Then “seizing the reality of power, he caused the Brahmans
who had enriched themselves tnder Harji to disgorge their
money and goods by the stroke al confiscation.”

But this squeezing of its former officials could not fill the


--- Page 336 ---
699] ZULFIQAR ARRIVES IN KARNATAK 331

gaping void of the Maratha Government’s financial distress.
The ministers af Jinji looked round to raise money from the
European settlements on the East Coast; the richer merchants
were urged to lend 3,000 or even 1,000 fun each. After
Rajaram’s coming, the French and Dutch agents continued
to inltigue against each other among the Maratha ministers,—
the Dutch offering a farge bribe for a proclamation expelling
the newly founded French factory at Pondicherry. The Jinji
ministers encouraged the game, “thinking only how to get the
maximum amount of money out of the one or the other.”
In January 1690, the Mughal cause suffered a temporary eclipse
from the rebellion of the old Haidarabadi local officers lately
faken over into the Emperor's setvice, viz, Muhammad Sadiq,
Vachapa Nayak and Ismail Maka. Finding themselves likely to
be replaced by former servants of the Emperor and doomed
fo unemployment or humbler offices, they deserted thei new
master, made an alliance with Rajaram, and began to usurp
the country and collect the revenue, The imperial represen-
fatives, from Madras 1o Kunimedu, were hopelessly outnum-
bered and defeated and forced to flee to the European
settlements on the coast (April). The rebellion was extinguished
only at {he approach of Zulfiqar Khan as the supreme Mughal
commander, who reached Conjeveram in August and the
environs of Jinji at the beginning of September.

The anilitary situation was now reversed ; the Maratha
raiding bands were driven back by the Mughals and “invasion
threatened the dominions of Rajaram.” In conslernation, that
king left Jinji and went to some safer refuge further south in
the Karnalak, nearer his ally the Rajah of Tanjore. The
miserable counlry from Jinji to the sea-coast continued to be
pillaged by: the camp-followers and “couriers” of both sides.
The local people fled with their families for safety far to the
south in Tanjore territory, or to the European factories on
ihe coast.

§ 13. Stege of Jinfi begins.

The rock-fortress of fJinji consists not of one fort, but of
three fortified hiflocks, Rajgiri, Krishnagiri, and Chandrayan-
durg,—connected together by strong lines of circumvallation,
and forming a rough triangle nearly three miles in circum-
ference. “These hills are steep, rocky and covered with such
enormous boulders that they are almost unclimbable. [ach
of the three is fortified on all sides with line above line of
stone walls, flanked with bastions, filled with embrasures for
guns, loopholed for musketry and pierced only by narrow
and strong gateways; and from each to the next, connected
with these defences, runs a great sfone-faced rampart nearly
60 feet thick with a ditch over SO fect wide oulside ih On
the three hills are the citadels.

The gates are three: one in the northern wall, now called
the Vellore or «Arcot gate, but known in the {7lh century as
the ‘gate towards Trinomali’; a second in the eastern face,
now called the Pondicherry gate, which was the principal
entrance into the fortin the {7th cenlury ; and due west of
this second gate, stands a small postern gate (in the wall
connecting Chandrayan with Rajgiri), called by the Indians
Shaitan-dact (or Port du Diable in French),

Zulfiqar Khan had reached Jinji early in September 1690,
but he merely sat down before it The investment of such
a vast group of forts with the fotees uncer him was out of
the question, and he had no heavy guns nor enough
munitions for a bombardment. [le cotild not prevent the
viclualling of the place, as a complete blockade was beyond
his power; and “the Marathas recovering from their first
consternation began to harass him incessantly.’ In the
February following, Rajaram returned to Jinji.

The military superiority of the Mughals was rapidly lost
after April, while the activity of the Maratha bands roving

around stopped the supply of grain to Zulfiqar’s camp. Tle
therefore begged urgently for reinforcements. This general's
father Asad Khan, the waaie, and Prince Kam Bakhsh, from
Wagingera, were sent with a large force and reached Jinji on
16th December, 1691.

In the meantime, Zulfiqar had abandoned his futile attacks
on jinji and turned to the more profitable work of levying
contributions from the zamindars of South Karnatak, Tanjore
and Trichinopoly. Thus the year 1691 passed without any
decisive success for the imperialists.

The next year was equally barren of results for them, in
spite of the great accession to their armed strength brought
by the prince and the wazir. Isinail [Khan Maka was induced
fo re-enter the Emperor's service and joined Zulfiqar’s camp
with his contingent. With these additions fo his forces,
Zulfiqar renewed the siege of Jinji in 1692, After some
changes he selected Chandrayan-durg as his objective and
ran trenches towards it. Then he began a bombardment of
this hill as well as of the Pondicherry gate. But all his
exertions were a mere show, as the country around knew
well.

The condition of the Mughal camp in the rainy season
of 1692 is thus described by an eye-witness: “The rain fell
with excessive severity. Grain was dear. The soldiers, having
fo spend days and nights together in the trenches, suffered
great hardship; the entire tract looked like one lake.”

§ 14. Santa Ghorpave and Dhana Jadav capture Ali
Mardan and Ismail Khan, 1692,

The Mughal position became absolutely untenable in
winter. Early in December, a vast Maratha force of more
than 30,000 horse, raised in Western India by Ramchandra
tthe chief agent of Rajaram) arrived in the Eastern Katnatak

under the celebrated generals Dhana Singh Jadav and Santa
Ghorpare.

The deluge of the newly arrived Maratha cavalry first
burst on the Conjeveram district. The terror inspired by
these brigands caused a panic flight of the inhabitants far and
near into Madras for refuge. When the division under Santa
arrived neat Kaveripak, Ali Mardan Khan, the Mughal fauidar
of Conjeverain, went out to encounter it, without knowing its
vast numbers. But his small force was hemmed round and
he was captured with 1,500 horses and six elephants. All the
property and materials of his army were looted (13th Dec.).
The Khan was taken to Jinji and secured his release by paying
the huge ransom of one laleh of Aun.

The other division of the Maratha reinforcements, led by
Dhana Jadav, atiacked the sicge-camps round Jinji. Zulfigar
saw himself hopelessly outnumbered, and wisely ordered his
outposts to fall in on his main army. But Ismail Khan, posted
west of the fort, had a longer distance to cross: the Marathas
helped by their brethren in the fort infercepted him. The Khan
offered a brave opposition io tenfold odds, but was wounded
and captured with 500 horses and iwo clephants, and carried
off as prisoner to Jinjii The victorious Marathas immediately
proclaimed their authority over the Haidarabadi Karnatak.

8 15. Prince Kam Bakhsh intrigues
with Marathas ; is acrested,

The revival of Maratha activity and predominance in the
surrounding country pul a stop to the free and plentiful
supply of grain in the Mughal camp. Il also stopped the
coming of feilers from the Emperor's Court. The Mughal
army outside Jinji was now besieged in iis turn, and its
condition became extremely dangerous by reason of
internal disputes. Prince Kam Bakhsh wasa_ foolish young
man, the spoilt child of his father’s old age, untaught to

na

bridle his passions, and ever swayed by his caprices and the
counsels of young and worthless favourites, He contrived
fo offend his guardian, the aged and influential wazir Asad
Khan. Through the medium of “some reekless and mad men”
he opened a_ secret correspondence with Rajaram. The
Marathas flattered the prince’s humour and mischievously
instigated him in new evil projects. Zulfiqar Khan soon learnt
the prince’s secret, and secured the Emperor's permission to
keep him under careful surveillance. As the result of the
arfival of Santa and Dhana in December 1699, for some
weeks communication with the Emperor's Court and the
Mughal base ceased altogether. Alarming rumours arose
immediately. [t was said that Aurangzib was dead and that
Shah Alam bad succeeded to the throne. Kam Bakhsh
considered himself in a most perilous position. Asad and
Zulfiqar were his enemies ; they would naturally try to win
the favour of the new Emperor by sending Kam Bakhsh in
chains to him. His only hope of safety, so his servants
assured him, fay in his making lerms with Rajaram, escaping
to the tort with his family on a dark night, and then trying
with Maratha aid to win the throne of Delhi.

This project also was reported to Asad Khan by his
spies. The wagir and his son consulted the leading officers
of the imperial army; they urged with one voice that the
prince should be strictly guarded, the trenches abandoned, and
the entire army concentrated in the rear lines.

The withdrawal from the siege lines was effected only after
severe fighting. Zulfigar burst his big guns by firing excessive
charges of powder and abandoned them where they stood.
The base-camp was four miles in his rear; the garrison
made a sortie, joined their brethren outside under Dhana
Jadav, and hemmed the Mughal army on all sides. The
imperialists lost 400 troopers, 400 horses and 8 elephants,
and at the close of the day they reached Asad Khan’s camp,


--- Page 341 ---
536 SHORT HISTORY OF .\URANGZIB lou. XV

Here the prince had plotted with his silly courtiers to arrest
these two generals at their next visit to him and then grasp
the supreme power. But this plot, like all others, had leaked
out. Zulfiqar Khan, worn out with his day-long fighting and
anxieties, reached his father’s side at night, learnt of the new
plot, and then the two leaders quickly decided that the safety
of the entire army and the preservation of the Emperor's
prestige alike demanded that the prince should be deprived
of the power of creating mischief. They immediately rode to
Kam Bakhsh’s quarters for arresting him.

The wazir was in a towering rage. He severely rebuked
the prince, calling him a cancing-girl’s son, unworthy to rule
over men or fo command in war. Then he continued,
“What is this that you have done? You have disgraced
yourself, and covered my grey hairs with disgrace.” The
prisoner was taken to Asad Khan’s own tent and treated
with every courtesy. Thus the Mughal army was saved by
establishing unity of control.

Santaji Ghorpare, flushed with his signal victory over
Ali Mardan Khan and the unresisted plunder of the Conjeveram
districl, now arrived at Jinji and turned his great talents and
energy against Zulfiqar. Fighting took place daily; “The
enemy exceeded 20,000 men, while the imperialists were a
small force and many of them were engaged in guarding the
prince and the camp. Kam Bakhsh’s contingent was unfriendly
and never lefl their tents to co-operate in the defence. The
whole brunt of the fighting fell on Zulfiqar Khan and a few
other mansabdars with only 9,000 horsemen.”

Ch

Jinfi to Wandeliwash,
But the Mughal army was now in a slate of siege and
famine was its worst enemy, In a few days scarcity deepened
into an absolute want of food. ‘“Zulfigar then marched out

with his own division to bring in grain from Wandiwash, 24
miles north-east of Jinjii When he set out on his return
(5 Jan. 1693), Santa with 20,000 men barred his path at
Desur, 10 miles soulhwards, and then enveloped his army.
The Mughals, after a hard fight, reached the shelter of the
forl of Desur at night. When they resumed their march
next morning, the Marathas brought a large force info the
field and made a most determined attack. But Dalpat, fighting
with desperate bravery, forced the Marathas to withdraw. The
Bundelas thus saved Zulffigar’s division and thereby saved
also the camp before Jinji

But the food brought by Zultiqar at such a heavy cost was
all too little for that huge multitude of soldiers and camp-
followers. The condition of the starving imperialists became
worse. “Every day from dawn fo sunset the Marathas assem-
bled round owe camp and made demonstrations. All the army,
high and low alike, were distracted and depressed.”

Asad Khan now made secret overtures of peace to
Rajaram, offering a heavy bribe if he was allowed to retreat
to Wandiwash unmolested. Rajaram agreed, On the other
side, Dalpat Rao urged Zulfiqar not to withdraw, as it would
only bring disgrace on him in the end. But while Zulfiqar
was hesitating, his*hands were forced by his artillerymen who
loaded their effects, left the camp and sent word to their
general that, as they were dying of hunger there, they were
going away to Wandiwash. Zulfiqar hac no help but to
start with the prince at noon. Owing to long continued
starvation, most of the horses, camels and other transport
animals of the army had _ perished. Most men set fire to
their belongings. Many stores of the Emperor ahd nobles
were left behind there. When the Mughal atmy marched out
of the camp, about a thousand Maratha horse came affer them
like a rear-guard, and «plundered the men of the army of
their properly. The imperialists reached Wandiwash in three

days, on 22nd or 23rd January 16935. Ten days later,
Qasim Khan, the newly appointed faujdar of Conjeveram
(vice Ali Mardan Khan), was reported to be coming from
Kadapa wilh abundant supplies anda strong foree. Santa
Ghorpare tried to intercept him; he aftacked Qasim and
pressed him so hard that he had to shut himself up in the
great temple enclosure of Conjeveram. Next day Zulfigar
attived to his aid, drove away the Marathas anc escoried
Oasim Khan to Wandiwash (7th February). Vood again
became abundant in the Mughal camp, and the troops were
further reassured by getting the latest news and letters from
the imperial Court telling them that the Emperor was alive
and well. Zulfigae made his camp at Wandiwash for four
months (February—May, 1693), abandoning the attack on
Jinfi for the present. He had to wait for the Emperor's orders
about Kam Bakhsh. Escorted by Asad Khan, that prince
arrived at the imperial camp at Galegala on 41 June, and
was presented to his father in the haretn through the
intercession of his sister Zinat-un-nisa.

8 17. Operations in Karnatak ducing 1695-94.

The Eastern Karnatale from the latitude of Madras to that
of Porto Novo, was at this lime occupied by three sets of
authorities, often in conflict with one another,~namely, the
representatives of the old Hindu local chieftains and Vijaynagar
viccroys, whom ihe conquering armies of the Bijapur and
Golkonda Sultans had imperfectly subdued ; the officers of
the lately subverted Bijapur and Golkonda Governments, who
were loath to recognize their new Mughal master ; and the
Maratha intruders representing the houses of Shivaji and
Vyankaji. To the first of these classes belonged Yachapa
Nayak, whose ancestors had obtained the fort of Satgarh
(26 miles west of Vellore) from the ministers of Rajah Pratap
Rudra of Warangal, and who once commanded the local


--- Page 344 ---
1694] ZULFIQAR’S CONQUESTS FROM TANJORE 30

Ou

levies (seAbandi) of Golkonda. When Rajaram reached Jinji,
Yachapa joined him. In March 1693 he left Rajaram, reco-
vered Satgarh, and began to extend his territory eastwards.
At the close of the year Zulfiqar Khan won him over, by
securing for him a mansab of 6-hazari.

Ismail Khan Maka, an ex-general of Golkonda and a local
zamindat, joined the Mughals whole-heartedly. Santaji Ghor-
pare besieged Trichinopoly in March; Rajaram himself arrived
there soon afterwards, and then went to visit bis first cousin
and friend Shahji Il at Tanjore (May 1695). But a quarrel
now broke out in the Maratha ranks; Santaji’s temper was
found intolerable and he left for Maharashtra in anger,
Dhanaji being appointed Senapati in his place.

Zalfiqar set out in February 1694 to conquer the South
Arcot district The fort of Peru-mukkal, 18 miles north of
Pondicherry, was stormed for him by Dalpat Rao’s Bundelas.
Then he marched down the East Coast, towards Tanjore, by
way of Pondicherry and other European factories, capturing
many forts in the South Arcot district, and skirting Cuddalore
at the end of February. When (in March 1694) the Mughal
general with his army arrived near Tanjore, Maharajah Shahji
fl found resistance vain, especially as his ever-hostile
neighbour, the Nayak of Trichinopoly, joined the Mughals.
So, Shahji had to yield; on 22nd May he signed a letter of
submission, promising to obey the Emperor's orders like a
faithful vassal in future, to cease from assisting Rajaram in
any way, to pay the Mughal Government a tribute of 30
lakhs of Rupees annually, and to cede the forts of Palamkota,
Sittanur and Tunganur with — their dependent districis as well
as several other places.

But Rajaram, who had mortgaged Palamkota to Vyankaji,
seized that fort for himself, so that Zulfigar had fo lay siege
fo it After six days the garrison capitulated. Then the
Mughal army returned to its base at Wandiwash and made

wnother atlack on Jinji in September. Jn this month Zulfigar
uddenly arrested Yachapa at a darbar and had him beheaded
on the charge of treason.”

§ 18. Zulfiqar’s movements and difficulties, 1698.

Zulfigar Khan renewed the siege of Jinji towards the close
f the year 1694, but it was a mere show intended to deceive
ye Emperor. The fact of his treasonable collusion with the
farathas was notorious in the country. lle had, during the
ourse and particularly at the end, of the siege of Jinji, an
nderstanding with Rajaram, in expectation of the death of the
ery old Aurangzib and the civil wars thal would surely
allow among his sons. “It is the practice of generals to
rolong operations for their own profit and ease.”

Nothing was achieved by the Mughals during 1695, while
1e scarcity of grain which raged there for the entire year
vensified their sufferings. Siege was laid to Vellore in
Yetober, but it held out for many years, (falling on 14 Aug.
709).

ulfiqar immediately raised the sicge, sent off his camp
aggage and family to Arcot, and prepared for action. In
larch 1696, Santa Ghorpare too arrived on the scene. The
iaratha bands spread io several paris of the country, the
iperialists with their depleted numbers could not defend so
any places. Zulfiqar wisely concentrated his forces ; but

throughout this year 1696 he was hampered by his extreme
want of money. le therefore confined himself solely to the
defensive in the fort of Arcot, as his strength was still weak.
The Marathas, as usual, hovered round him, there being a
secrel understanding between the two sides lo spare
each olher. In| November anc December Santa entered
Central Mysore, and Zulfiqar, under orders of the Emperor,
pursued him there and co-operated with Prince Bidar Bakht,
who had reached that province from the north-west for
expelling the Marathas from beyond the Tungabhadra. These
two Mughal forees united near Penu-konda (75 miles norih
of Bangalore). The elusive Marathas disappeared without
offering battle, and Zulfigar returned to Arcot in February
1697.

§ 20. Stege of Jinji renewed ; fall of the fort.

He again left Arcot to collect tribute from Tanjore and
other places in the south. Then he returned to Wandiwash to
canton for the vainy season of 1697. Flappily for him, the
Marathas were now very much weakened by a bilfer and
final rupture between Dhana and Santlaji, Rajaram had sided
with Dhana, an internecine war raged among the Marathias,
and finally Dhana had been defeated by his rival and
driven bacle fo Maharashtra (May 1696). Early in November
1697 Zultiqar renewed the siege of Jinji in right earnest.

He himself took post opposite the northern gate, Ram
Singh Hada against the Shaitandari, and Daud Khan Pani
before Chikkali-durg, half a mile south of Jinji. Daud Khan
captured Chikkali-clurg in one day by a reckless assault at
close quarters, and then, coming to Jinji itself, enttenched
opposite  Chandrayangarh, the southern fort. If Zulfiqar
had wished it, he cotld have taken the entire fort the next
day. But his secret policy was to prolong the siege in order
to keep his army together, enjoy his emoluments, and escape

542 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB fon. XV

the hardships of active duty on some new expedition.
He let the Marathas know that his attacks ,were for show only,
and thus the siege dragged on for two months more.

At last it became necessary for Zulfiqar to capture the
fort if he wished to avoid disgrace and punishment by his
master. Rajaram received timely warning, and escaped to
Vellore with his chief officers, but leaving his family behind.
Then Zulfiqgar gave the order for the assaull. Dalpat Rao
scaled the northern walls of Ktrishna-giri and captured the
outer fort after a severe struggle. The garrison retreated to
an inner fort called Kalafot, which Dalpai’s Bundelas entered
pell-mell with them and occupied. The surviving Marathas
took refuge in Rajgiri or the highest fort. Meantime Daud
Khan had made his way into Chandrayan-garh and advanced
through the city or the low inner plain of Jinji towards
Krishna-giri, The inhabitants fled fo the lop of Krishna-giti,
but finding no safety there, capitulated. A vast amount of
boofy in horses, camels and things fell into the hands of the
imperialists (8th January, {698). Rajaram’s family was now
invested in Rajgiri, but their situation was hopeless. Ram
Singh Hada made his way to the summit of Rajgiri by
crossing ithe chasm at its foot by means of a wooden
gangway, The Maratha royal family was promised safety ;
four wives, three sons and two daughters of Rajaram now
came out of the cifadel and were kept in honourable
captivity. Another wife of the Rajah avoided surrender
by death; she flung herself down from the summit of the
fort into the sheer depths below. Nearly 4,000 men, women
and children were found in the forl, but very few combatants.

* Wilkes (7. 133).—To preserve appéaranees il was necessary to renort (to the
Empecior) frequent attacks and repittses. On the other side, Daud Khan, second
in command of the Mughal army, deank largely of the best European liquory, and
when full of the god would perpetually volunteer the extirpation of the infictels,
Zulfiqar necessarily assented to these enterprises, but always gave secret intelligence
ta the enemy of the titte and place of atlacts; and the troops of Daud Khan were
as often repulsed with slaughter.”

1695] QASIM KHAN DEFEATED BY SANTA 343

From Jinji Zulfiqar (now honoured with the title of Nusrat
Jang) returned to his base at Wandiwash, and then pursued
Rajaram from Vellore to Garamkonda. But the Maratha king
had a good start of him and escaped to Vishalgarh in safety
(Feb). Thus the entire work of the Emperor’s long sicge
of Jinji was undone. The bird had flown away.

~

§ 21. Qasim Khan defeated by Santa Ghorpare, dies
al Dodderi, 1695.

The Maratha captains infested various parts of Mughal
Deccan in the usual manner throughout October and November
1695. Early in November, Santa, who had been looting the
Bijapur district, vainly pursued by an imperial detachment
ander Uimmat Khan south of the Krishna, now turned south-
wards to convey his rich slore of plunder fo his own estate
in N. W. Mysore.

Aurangzib, then encamped at Islampuri, ordered Qasim
Khan to intercept the raiders. To reinforce Qasiin Jhan, he
sent a detachment from his own camp under some of his
highest younger officers, including Khanazad Khan (afterwards
Lord High Sleward), Though 4,800 troopers in actual muster,
it was a very choice corps, being composed of men
from the Emperor’s guards and personal retinue and the
contingents of the nobles who had to patrol round his tent on
different days of the week, They joined Qasim Khan about
12 miles from the Marathas’ expected track. Santa, who had
been roving ata distance, heard of his enemy’s position and
movements, came up with them by swift marches, and skilfully
matured a plan for their destruction, which the luxury and
thoughtlessness of the Mughal generals crowned with the mosl
complete success imaginable. Qasim Khan rose to the height
of hospitality and ostentation in order io receive worthily the
noble guests coming to him from Court, and cliscarded the simple
and light Rit of a general who would wage war with the

344 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIS fou. XV

Marathas wisely. Santa Ghorpare showed the highest tactical
power in making his dispositions and moving his three distinct
and scattered divisions so as lo ensure the perfect timing of
their movements and exact co-operation among them. He
divided his army into three bodies, of which one was sent
to plunder the Mughal camp, another to fighl lhe soldiers,
and the third was held in reserve ready for action wherever
required. Barmappa Nayak, the zamindar of the Chittaldury
district, now sided with the Marathas in lhe hope of a share
of the spoils, and thus the Mughals were ringed round by
enemies and cut off from all information.

An hour and a half after sunrise, (about 20th November)
the first Maratha division fell upon Qasim Khan’s advanced tents
(six miles fo the front), slew and wounded the guards and servants,
catried off everything they could, andset fire to the heavy tents.
On the news of it reaching Qasim Khan, he hurried towards
the point of attack. Before he had gone two miles, the second
body of the enemy appeared in front and the battle began.
The enemy’s numbers were overwhelming, and they had a
very large body of Kala~piada musketecrs,—-the best marksmen
and bravest infantry of the Decean,~in addition to their
numberless mobile light cavalry. A great battle was fought
and many were slain on both sides. Then the reserve division
of Santa Tell upon the camp anct baggage left behind by the
Mughals and looted everylhing. This news reached Qasim and
Khanazad in lhe heat of the battle and shook their firmness.
They took counsel logether and fell back on Dodderi.” The
fort of Dodderi was small and the foocl-store in if limited. So
its imperial garrison shut its gates upon their newly arrived
comrades, The two Khans had {o encamp outsicle. As the
night closed, the enemy completely encircled them; for three

days the Marathas only appeared in sight without fighting,
til some thousands of intantry sent by Barmappa Nayak,
joined them. Then they seized the opportunity and made an
attack on the fourth day. The imperial artillery munitions
had been plundered in their camp and what litle was carried
will the soldiers was now exhausted ; so afler vain exertions
for same hours, they sat down in despair, a helpless target
for the Kanarese musketeers. Tully one-third of the Mughal
army had been slain at the two camps, during the retreat,
and on the banks of the tank of Dodderi.

Then the chiefs saved their own lives by sneaking into the
fort, abandoning their soldiers. The Muslim soldiery now
faced utter starvation, Qasim Khan was a great eater of
opium, and the lack of ihe drug caused his death on the third
day. [But many people suspected that he committed suicide
to escape disgrace at lhe bands of the enemy ancl censtre
by the Emperor]

When ihe food supply was absolutely exhausted and the
water in the fort became scanty and unwholesome, Khanazad
Khan, in despair of relief, sent his diwan and a Deecani
captain of the imperial army to Santa to beg for terms of
capitulation ; the ransom was fixed at 20 lakhs of rupees ;
and all the cash, articles, jewels, horses and elephants of the
doomed army were to be given up. The lean woe-begone
and bedraggled remnant of the imperial army filed out of the
forl 13 days after enlering it The enemy gave them bread
from one side and water from the other. After resting for
hwo days, Khanazad siarted for the Court with a Maratha
escort, Ile had lost everything.

8 22. Santa slays Himmat Khan at Basavapatan.

In less than a month from this stroke, Santa achieved
another and equally famous victory by killing Himmat Khan

Khan and had taken refuge in Basavapatan (40 miles west
of Dodderi) on account of the smallness of his force. On
90th January 1696, Santa appeared belore flimmat Khan's
position at the head of ten thousand cavalry and nearly the
same number of infantry. {lis Karnataki foot-musketeers—the
best marksmen in lhe Deccan, took post on a hill. [limmat
Khan, with a very small force, advanced to the attack and
dislodged them from it, but as he was driving his elephant
towards the place where Santa was standing, he was suddenly
shot by a bullet in the forehead. After some days the
Marathas withdrew with the captured baggage of the Khan.

On the 28th of January the Emperor learnt ol immat
Khan's death and the blockade of his troops in the fort of
Basavapatan by Santa ; and a great effort was made to gather
troops and retrieve the position in N. W. Mysore. Hamid-ud-
din Khan started on ist February for the relief of Basavapalan.
Some twenly miles before his destination he was altacked by
Sania (26th February). But the Marathas were defeated and
driven out of that region, and Basavapatan was relieved.

8 93. Mililary arrangements of the imperialists
duving 1696.

Prince Bidar Bakht had been orcered (end of January) to
march from Panhala to Basavapatan. Arriving at this place in
afew weeks, he stayed there for some time, sencting oul
detachments to punish the rebel zamindars of the — district.
Barmappa Nayak of Chittaldure made a humble submission
and promise of loyalty, on {6th May. Prince Muhammad
Agam had been sent from the Empertot’s camp at Islamputi
fo Pedgaon (Bahadurgarh} 90 miles north of it in February
1696, and this place remained his headquarters till he was
recalled to the Emperor's side at Miraj three years fater.

In March 1697, Santa Ghorpare returned from the East
Coast fa the Satara district, and Miruz Jang was despalched

against him. Buta civil war among the Maratha generals
weakened their power during the first half of the year 1697.

§ 24. Civil war between Sania Ghorpare and
Diana Jada; deatfi of Santa.

Flushed wilh his far-resounding victories over these hvo
first-rate Mughal generals in the west, Santa went to Jinji to
wait on Rajaram (March 1698). He seems to have claimed
the office of Senapati, contrasting his own brilliant per-
formances with Dhana’s poor record of victories. But
his vanity, imperious temper and spirit of insubordination
gave great offence to the Court at Jinji and the result was
an open rupture near Conjeveram (May 1696). Rajaram
sided with Dhana and placing Amrit Rao Nimbalkar in the
van of his artny, attacked his refractory general, But Santa’s
genius again triumphed; Dhana was defeated and driven
precipitately to his home in Western India; Amrit Rao fell
on the field.

After ranging through the Eastern Karnatak for many months
Santa finally returned fo the homeland in March 1697. Here an
internecine war now taged between him and Dhana, ali the other
captains being ranged on the two sides. They fought together
in the Satara’ districl in March 1697, But fortune now
deserted Santaji; his severily and insolence had disgusted his
officers, and most of them deserted lo Dhana, while the rest
were killed or wounded. Santa, despoiled of all and
deserted by his army, fled from the field with only a few
followers to Mhaswad, the home of Nagoji Mané whose
wife’s brother Amrit Rao he had killed. Nagoji gave Sania
shelter and food for some days, and then dismissed him in
safely. But his wife Radha Bai, with a woman's ufquenchable

bathing in a nala near the Shambhu Mahadev hill, in the
Satara district. The party from Mbhaswad surprised him in
this helpless situation and cul off his head, June, 1697).

Santaji had an inborn genius for handling laree bodies ot
troops spread over a wide area, changing his tactics so as
to fake prompt advantage of every change in the enemy's
plans and condition, and organizing combined movements.
The success of his tactics depended on the rapid movement
of his troops and on his subordinates carrying out his orders
punctually fo the minute. Tle, therefore, insisted! on implicit
obedience from his officers and enforced the strictest discipline
in his army by draconic punishments; and, hence naturally
“most of the Maratha nobles became his enemies.”

The two lifelong rivals, Santa and Dhana, were both
army leaders and organizers of the highest ability, courage
and activity, bul with contrasted characters. Dhana mace
war like a genileman. Ue was mederate in viclory,
generous to the vanquished, polite in his adclress, practised
in self-control, and capable of taking long views and
making slatesmanly arrangements. His inborn courtesy to the
Mughal generals who had the misfortune to encounter him, is
noticed with praise by the Muslim historians. Moreover, he
served his country’s Government unsellishly for many years,

Santaji Ghorpare, on the other hand, was in comparison
with Dhana, a barbarian devoid of culture or generosily,
unable to restrain his passions or to take lhought of the distant
future. Ile loved to hustle all whom he met wilh, not
excepling his king. He showed no mercy and expected none.
By his temperament, Santa was incapable of co-operating
with others, and he had not the patriotism to subordinate his
own will to the needs of his nation. He exercised no
influence on the political history of the Marathas or even on
the general effect of Aurangzib’s campaigns. tle merely
flashed through the Deccan sky fike a-lonely meteor.

1699| RAJARAM'S LAST YEAR OF LIFE 349

§ 95. Rajaram’s return fome and doings in 1698-99,

Nothing remarkable seems to have happened in the second
half of {697, except a heavy flood of the Bhima river which
washed away the Mughal camps at Pedgaon and
Islampuri (19 July) and spread universal misery and ruin.
But in January next, Jinji fell to the Mughals, Rajaram fled
from it and reached Vishalgarh in Mahatashtra in the following
month. It is not probable that any unusual activity was
shown by the Marathas immediately after Rajaram’s return
home. Ile seems to have taken fime to tecover from the
effects of the loss of Jinji, Some of his followers at this time
deserled his service in despair and joined the Mughals.

Early in 1699 Rajaram set out on a tour of inspection in
Konkan, visiting all his forts, and returned to Satara at the
end of June. Forming plans for an extensive raid through
Khandesh and Berar, he sallied out of Satara, about 26th
October.

Evidently Aurangzib’s intention to besiege this fort first
had feaked out, for, immediately afler his starting from
Isampuri (9th Oct), Rajaram removed his family from
Satara fo Khelna and himself left it on 26th October in order
to escape falling into the Emperor's hands, Dhana_ Jaclav,
Ramchandra, Dado Malhar and other generals, with 7,000
cavalry escorted him fo Chandan-Wandan, whence, after a
three days’ halt, he toole the route to Surat.

The Emperor immediately sent urgent orders to Bidar
Bakht to purste and defeat this hostile force. Four miles
beyond the fort of Parenda, Bidar Bakht came upon the
Maralhas. After a bloody fight, they were broken and driven
towards Ahmadnagar, (13th or 14th November). On 26th
December, Rajaram was reporicd as having disrmounted some
30 miles from fhe imperial camp below Satara fort and
infending fo go to Vishalgarh. The Maratha king’s raid into


--- Page 355 ---
350 SHORT INSTORE OF AURANGZIB [en XV

Berar had been nipped in the bud. But one division uncer
Krishna Savant plundered some places near Dhamuni and
returned. This was the ficst time that a Maratha force crossed
the Narmada.

Meantime, batiles had been fought with the other Maratha
bands too. On 9th January 1700 Nusrat Jang (Zulfiqar) fought
Dhana, Ranuji Ghorpare, and Hanumant Rao beyond Masur, and
defeated them, killing 500 of their men. A few clays later
Dhana attacked the outpost of Khanapur and carried off its
Mughal officer, Avji Adhal.

In the meantime the Emperor’s siege of Satara continued
and battles took place in its environs between the Mughal
invaders and the Maratha field armies.

§ 26. Death of Rajaram; Tata Bai's policy.

On 2nd March 1700, Rajaram died at Singhgarh, of a
fever which was most probably caused by the hardships of
his caid and the vehement pursuit by the Mughals. His
family was then in the fort of Vishalgarh. His favourite
natural son Karna was immediately afterwards crowned as
king by his ministers, with the help of Dhana Jadav, but died
of small-pox in three weeks, Then his legitimate son by his
wife Tara Bai was placed on the throne as Shivaji If, with
the support of Ramchandra, ‘the Regent of the West’
An internecine quarrel now broke oul in the Maratha Court
between Rajaram’s surviving widows, Tara Bai and Rajas Bai
(the mothers of Shivaji IT and Shambhufi Il respectively), each
standing up for her own son and supported by a faction
among the officers and generals. Bul the ability and energy
of Tata Bai, the elder wife, gave her the supreme power in
the State, ,

Immediately after learning of her husband’s death, Tara
Bai offered submission to the Emperor, asking for a 7-hazati
mansab and the deshmukhi rights over the Deccan for

KONKAN, ITS GEOGRAPHY AND [IMPORTANCE 331

Rajaram’s legitimate son, and proposing to supply a contingent
of 5,000 men for service under the imperial viceroy of the
Deccan, and to cede seven forts. Aurangzib refused this offer.
Towards the end of May, Ramchandra’s agent Ramaji Pandit
and Parashuram’s agent Ambaji visited Prince Azam and
beeged him to intercede wilh the Emperor for sparing Rajaram’s
young son in return for the surrender of the Maratha forts.
These overtures seem to have been insincere and came to
nothing,

§ 97. The war in Konkan, 1689-1704,

Going southwards from Surat, the traveller meets
suecessively with the following divisions of the long coast-
strip between the Western Ghat range and the Arabian Sea:—
first, Kofvan or the broken country inhabited by the wid
Koli tribe (forming the Jawhar and Dharampur States), then
North Konkan (or the modern Thana and Kolaba districts,
parallel lo the Nasile and Puna districls which lie east of the
Ghats), and lastly Sout# Konkan (or the modern Ratnagiri
district, which rans parallel to the Satara and Kolhapur districts
of the Deccan plateau across fhe mountain range). At the
southernmost point of Ratnagiri, the coast is broken, near
Vingurla, by the territory of the ancient Maratha family of
Savants of Vadi (popularly known as the ‘Desais of Kudal’ in
in the 17th century), and immediately south of it, by the
Portuguese province of Goa. Still further south begins Kanara,
with the Karwar district along the coast, and the States of
Sunda and Bednur in the interior, far to the east, leading
into the Mysore plateau.

Through a gap in the Western Ghats near the cily of
Nandurbar, some distance north of Dharampur, an invading
force from the coastal region could easily enter the rich
provinces of Khandesh and Berat,--while Kolvan afforded

wards across the Chandor range, for incursions into the Nasik
district,

Shivaji had conquered Konkan between 1657 and 1669
and the Koli country in (670-1673. After his death the
Mughals had made descents into N. Konkan in 1682 and 1685
and temporarily occupied its capilal Kalian, but more to ravage
and burn the places than to hold them. In December 1683
the Marathas reoccupied Kalian and remained in undisturbed
possession of Konkan for the next five years, though their
» coast-villages lay subject to depredation by the Siddis. Mughal
progress in this region began only in 1689 and under a
very able local officer.

Matabar Khan, a Sayyid of the Navaiyat clan of Arabs
long settled in Kalian, when cmployved as thanadar of the
Nasik district, first distinguished himselt (1688) by his enterprising
spirit and farsighledness. He enlisted a strong infaniry force
of the local hill-men, won over many of the zamindars in the
neighbourhood and captured) many Maratha forls by force
or bribery, ag. Patta (Vishramgarh), Kulang, Trimbak {on
$ January 1689), and several smaller ones. The triumphant
Mughal general crossed the Ghats and descended into Konkan
after the fall of Shambhuji. In this province he took Kalian
(27 March), Prabal, Karnala, Dugad, Manikgarh, and finally
Mahuli (in Ausust), Thus all North Konkan from the Koli
counlry southwards to the latitude of Bombay passed into
imperial possession. Most parts of the district bad been
ruined by twenty years of Maratha predominance and frequent
warfare. We established imperial rule over them, restored
order, and planted colonies of peasants so as to revive their
cultivation and prosperity,

“After these successful campaigns Matabar Khan returned
to Kalian (1690) and lived there in comparative peace for
some years, beautifying that city with a governor's mansion,


--- Page 358 ---
MATABAR KHAN GOVERNOR OF KALIAN 555

a hall of public audience, a mosque, a Turkish bath, a portico,
a garden and a terrace with a tank and fountains, and other
structures. The magnificent tomb of his wife in Kalian was
built at the cost of one lakh of Rupees.

But early in 1695, the Marathas recovered their power
and the Mughals lost their dominant position and were driven
to assume the defensive. Roving Maratha bands began to
raid Mughal territory and recover the forts recently acquired
by the imperialisis. Konkan served the Marathas as an
excellent base for organizing these operations, as the Western
Ghats formed a sereen in their front, while the possessions
ot the friendly Portuguese along the western coast afforded
a safe refuge fo the wives and children of their fighters even
when the enemy descended inlo the eastern belt of Konkan.
The local Portuguese governor was bribed by them to give
them sheller and to supply provisions to their forts and villages
in North Konkan.

Matabar Khan, therefore, invaded the Portuguese territory
of “the North” (fe, Bassein and Daman), making prisoners of
the enemy’s subjects, and defeating their armies, The viceroy
of Goa at last made peace by humble submission to the
Emperor and the offer of presents,

The  news-let ters of Aurangzib’s Courl contain many
examples of Matabar’s vigilant care for his charge, his strict
maintenance of efficiency in the administration, and _ his
assistance to the Siddi chicf of Janjira in the military operations
further south for upholding the imperial power. Death overtook
this able and faithful servant at {he end of February 1704.

CHAPTER XVI
THE LAST PHASE OF AURANGZIB’S CAREER.

‘8 1, Policy of the Maratha Government, 1689-1699.

When Rajaram, the newly crowned king of the Marathas,
fled away to the Madras coast (July, 1689), affairs in the
Maharashira country were left to his ministers. Ramchandra
Nilkanth was created Regent of the West, with the litle of
Hakumat-panaf, and he guided the fortunes of this virtually
kingless State with remarkable wisdom and tact. Ile checked
the progress of the Mughals, organized raids into imperial
territory, sent succour repealedly to his master in Jinji, and
kept peace among the intractable and mutually jealous
Maratha generals.

Rajaram, in addition to being plunged into debauchery
in the KKarnatak, was naturally weak-minded. Ilis position
made him powerless. He was a king without an army or
treasury of his own, or subjecls under his undisputed rule.
Any Maratha captain who could get tegelher a thousand or
even five hundred men of his own, could dictate the terms
of his obedience to his nominal king. Rajaram was, therefore,
profuse in his gifts of filles and unconquered lands. All the
Maratha sardars went to the king at Jinji, and he gave them
fitles, army commands, and grants for the different districts
where they were io go, loot the country, and impose the
chauth. Rajaram’s political impotence is best illustrated by
‘his duplication of offices and filles at a time when his king-
dom was shrinking to nothing. He could not afford to
disoblige any of his proud and selfish chiefs. The office of
Senapati (commander-in-chief) was changed five times in


--- Page 360 ---
{700] CONDITION OF MARATHA LEADERS 355

Rajaram's short reign of cleven years ; and, in addition, five
officers at one lime enjoyed titles varying in terminology but
all meaning “leader ot the army” and all being entitled to
the rank banner and other paraphernalia of the Senapati !
But this decentralization of authority was exactly suited
to the situation in Maharashlra. The Maratha captains, each
acting on his own account, carried on a guerilla warfare
and caused the greatest loss and disturbance to the Mughal
territories. The imperialists did not know what point to
defend, nor where to find a vital enemy position for their
attack. The extremely mobile Maratha bands covered long
distances and delivered attacks at the mos! unexpected
quarters ; and such roving bands were countless, The result
was universal unrest throughout the Deccan. At this stage
the Marathas avoided pitched battles. Their encampments
during the rainy months were in obscure and inaccessible
places. Their bands did not hold together all the year
round but dispersed to their several homes after the cam-
paigning season of six months (October to April) was over.
There was mutual jealousy among the ministers left in
Maharashtra as well as at the Court of Jinji, Parashuram
Trimbak formed a faction of his own and drew Santaji
Ghorpare into it The natural consequence was that Dhana
Singh Jaday was backed by Ramchandra. Santa’s insubordi-
nation proved unbearable; he would not obey the Regent
of the West, nor co-operate in any national enterprise (like
the relief of Parthala in 1693) planned by him, preferring to
conquer an independent estate for himself. Ramchandra had,
therefore, lo secure the king’s consent to Santa’s dismissal,
Then another minister Shankaraji Malhar took Santa under
his wing. Another refractory and selfish general of great
power was Nima Sindhia. Ramchandra struggled against
these clifficulties as best he could, and on the whole he
succeeded fairly well. The rivalry between Santa Ghorparé


--- Page 361 ---
3556 SHORY HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [con XVI

and Dhana Jadavy precipitated a civil war in 1696, and three
battles were fought between them. The murder of Santa
(June 1697) created a blood-feud between his son Ranuji and
his brother Baharji (Gurnamed Hindi Rao) on the one hand
and Dhana’s patly on the other, which took long to heal.
But this internal discord among the Marathas vave the Mughals
only a brief respite.

Ramchandra cleverly provided shelters for the families of
the Maratha combatants in South Konkan and the Portuguese
territory of Daman, which had not yet been penetrated by
Mughal armies, and also in the Berad country and the north-
western corner of Mysore, which the Emperor was not yet
free fo invade.

8 9, ata Bai rules as queen-mother ; internal
dissensions in tRe Maratha Slate.

When Rajaram died, on 9nd March 1700, and then his
natural son Karna after a three weeks’ reign, Tara Bai
crowned her own (legitimate) son Shivaji, a boy under ten
years, and ruled with the help of Parashuram Trimbak. Thus
a second regency enstied in the Maratha kingdom. The
supreme gttiding force in Maharashtra now was not any
minister but the dowager queen Tara Bai Mohité Ter
administrative genius and strength of character saved the
nation in the awful crisis that threatened it in consequence of
Rajaram’s death, the disputed succession to his throne, and
Aurangzib’s unbroken victories from 1699 lo 1701, The
hostile Muslim historian Khafi Khan is conslrained to call her
wise, enterprising, expert in administration and popular with
the army. “Under Tara Bai's guidance, Maratha activity
began {o Increase daily. She took into her own hands the
control of all affairs~-such as the appointment and change of
generals, the cultivation of the country and the planning of
raids into Mughal territory. She made such arrangements for


--- Page 362 ---
INTERNAL QUARRELS OF MARATIHA COURT 357

sending troops to ravage the six subahs of the Deccan, nay
even up to Stronj and Mandesor in Malwa—and winning the

hearts of her officers, that all the efforts of Aurangzib against
the Maralhas down to the end of bis reign failed.”

Immediately after the death of Rajaram, Parashuram
Trimbak, out of jealousy for ihe ofher ministers then in Satara,
came out of his own fort of Parli and offered to join the
Mughals. But Tarabai won this supremely able officer over
to her interests by creating him Pratinidfii and giving him her
full trust. Bul it was only after a hard struggle that Tara
Bai’s supremacy was established. Some of the generals
obeyed her, some did not Rajas Bai, the junior wife of
Rajaram and the mother of Shambhujfi I, whom she set up
as a rival king, began to quarrel with Tara Bai and form her
own faction. There was a third party among the Maratha
leaders, who yanted to secure national unity by placing
Shahu on the throne, as he represented the elder branch of
Shivaji's descendants. These dynastic quarrels were complicated
bv the cross-currents of personal rivalry among the Maratha
gencrals, especially Dhana Jaday and Santa Ghorpare and
their partisans,

8 3. Shafu's captive life, 16891707 ;
Maratha partisans of the Muaghats.

Shahu, the eldest son of Shambhuji, had become a prisoner
of the Mughals at the age of seven, when Raigarh surrendered
in October 1689, and he was kept under strict watch, though
kindly tecaled, close to the Emperor’s tent and within the
circle of the red canvas screen (gulal~bar) of the imperial
quarters. With him were his mother Yesu Bai and his half.
brothers Madan Singh and Madhu Singh.

In 1700 Shahu had a severe attack of illness, which seems
fo have left his body and mind shattered for the rest of his


--- Page 363 ---
358 SHORT INSTORY OF AURANGZIB [eu. XVI

life. The Court news-letier gives the following account of it :—
Rajah Shahu came to the audience on 26th August and made
his bow. The Emperor afler looking at him remarked that
his colour had turned entirely yellow, and asked the reason
for it. Hafiz Ambae (eunuch) replied that the rajah did not
eat any cooked dal, bread or rice, but only sweets (pakivan),
on the ground that Hindus must not eal cooked food in
prison, and he regarded himself as a prisoner.

As difficulties thickened round Aurangzil and the Deccan
tangle seemed insoluble, he began to form plans for
settling the contest with the Maratha generals through Shahu.
First, on 9th May 1703, he sent Hamid-ud-din Khan to
urge Shahu to become a Muslim, as the heirs to some other
Hindu thrones had already been tempted fo do in _ this
reign. But Shabu refused to apostatize. Next the Emperor
fried to create a division among the Maralhas by releasing
Shahu. The terms of his release were to be sttiled by trealy
with the leading Maratha generals, through the mediation of
Prince Kam Bakhsh. [For approaching the tational teaders
and winning them over, Raibhan, the son of VWyankaiji
Bhonsle of Tanjore, was laken into the Emperor’s service,
created a 6-fazari, and sent to visit Shahu (10th July 1703).
But the move failed, As Bhimsen bluntly puts it ;—‘“The
prince repeatedly sent his men fo Dhana. Bul, as the
Marathas had not been vanquished and the entire Deccan
had come into their possession like a deliciously cooked
pudding, why should they make peace ?...The envoys of
the prince returned in disappointment, and Rajah Shahu was
again placed uncer surveillance in the grtlal-bar.”

Aurangzib felt himself utterly helpless. In the last year
of his life (1707) he decided to make another attempt at
peace with the Marathas, Shahu was transferred from his
own camp fo that of Nusrat Jang (25 Jan.). Raibhan, too, was
posted under him in the hope of his being able to persuade


--- Page 364 ---
MARATHA ALLIES OF MUGIIALS 3559

the Maratha generals to make terms with the Emperor as the
price of the release of Shahu. Nusrat Jang wrote conciliatory
letters to the Maratha generals and invited them to come and
join Rajah Shahu. But tt was to no effect. A civil war had
indeed broken oul among the Marathas, Rajas Bai trying to
seize Tara Bai and thwarting all her plans ; but the Emperor’s
hope of taking advantage of il and creating a further division
by bringing Shahu into it, failed. It was only after Aurangzib’s
death that Prince Azam, then marching towards Agra, connived
at the escape of Shahu fo the Deccan,

It is not frue that all the leading Maratha families were on
the national side during the struggle with Aurangzib. Many of
them served the Mughal Government, and for various reasons.
The noble house of Jaday Rao of Sindhkhed, in which the
great Shivaji’s mother had been born, entered the Mughal army
early in Shah Jahan’s reign (1630), after the murder of Lalkhji
Jadav Rao, and they remained on the imperial side for
several generalions. Kanhoji Shirké and his sons, fo whose
family Rajaram’s mother belonged, had been persecuted by
Shambhuji and had ded for refuge to the Mughal Emperor,
who gave them high posts. The Shirkés as well ad Nagojie
Mané (the thanadar of Mhasvad ancl a Mughal partisan from
1694) remained consistently loyal and rendered long and
meritorious service fo the Mughals, Three other devoted
Maratha servants of the Emperor were Avji Adhal (thanadar
of Khanapw) who was made captive by the Marathas on
23rd Jan. 1700, Ramebandra (thanadar of Khatau) who died
fighting at his post on, 18th August 1700, and Baharjt Pandhré,
sometimes thanadar of Kashigaon.

Another Maratha chief in Mughal pay was Satvaji Daflé,
who had a more chequered career. This family had been
barons under the Adcil-Shahi Rings. On the fall of that
monatchy they took service with thé Mughal conqueror. [Satva’s
son, Baji Chavan Daflé gave up his life most heroically in


--- Page 365 ---

leading the storming party al the siege of Satara (13th April
1700). Satva himself had deserted the Mughals before
1695 and continued fo raid the imperial tertitory, but came
over to the Emperor in August 1701, when he was erealed a
5-hazari, and given the jagir of Jath in reward of his late
son's gallantry.

Several thousands of Mavlés, or Maratha hill infantry,
served under Aurangzib. But on the whole the presence of
hired Maratha auxiliaries on the Mughal side had merely the
effect of keeping them out of mischief, and did not add much
to the strength of the imperial army. For one thing, their
equipment and armament were far inferior fo those of the
regular Mughal troops. Then, they fought half-heariedly for
their paymaster, and their caplains frequently changed sides,

§ 4. Aurangaib’s siege of Satara.

On 19th October 1699, Aurangzib slarted from Islampuri on
that campaign against the great Maratha strongholds which was lo
occupy the next six years of his life. One by one the famous
*hill-forts of Satara, Parli, Panhala, Vishalgarh (Chelna), Kondana
(Singhgarh), Rajgarh, and Torna were captured by him, besides
five places of lesser note. But it should be remembered thal
with the sole exception of Torna, none of these was faken by
assault; all capitulated affer a me and for a price; their
garrisons were permitted to march out with their personal
effects, and their commandants were given costly rewards for
ceasing resistance, ‘ :

At Islamputi Aurangzib left his wife Udipuri and her son
Kam Bakhsh, and his daughter Zinat-tn-nisa, with all the
surplus baggage and unnecessary officials, and the families of
his soldiers and camp-followers. The wazir Asad Khan
remained in charge of them with a suitable force. Zulfiqar,
surnamed Nusrat Jang, was given a roving commission for


--- Page 366 ---
1700] AURANG7IB BESIEGES SATARA 361

fighting the Maratha field armies that hovered round the — siege
camp or threatened the Base at Islamputi.

Marching from Islampuri the Emperor reached Masur (24
miles south of Satara) on 2{st November. Basantgarh, a fort
6 miles south-west of Masur, was evacuated by iis garrison
in ferror, and the imperialists entered it on the 95th and named
it the “Key to Victory” (Kifid-i-Fath), as a bappy omen of
their success in the ensuing campaign.

Marching thence, the imperialists arrived before Satara on
8th December. Aurangzib took up his quarters at the village
of Karanja, a mile and a half fo the north of the fort-walls.
The Mughal army with its followers and transport animals was
concentrated in one spot, five miles round, and this encamp-
ment was walled round to keep out the Maratha raiders. Siege
operations began on 9{h December. The rocky soil made
digging a very slow and difficult work. The garrison fired
upon the Mughals day and night withoul cessation with every
kind of missile. But the lines of investment were not complete.
The enemy entered and issued from Satara almost fo the end
of the siege.

The garrison made frequent sorties, all of which were
repulsed with more or less loss. But the greatest danger to
the Mughals came from the Maratha field forces, which practi-
cally recditced the besiegers to the position of a beleaguered
city. Foraging parlies could leave the Mughal camp only
under very strong escorts, led by the foremost nobles. Dhana,
Shankara, and other enemy leaders spread through the Mughal
possessions, raiding villages, culting off outposts and closing
the roads to the grainsdealers (Ganfaras).

Tarbivat Khan by hacd labour dug a mine 24 yards long
and carried it under the fortwall, But assault by breaching
was deemed inadvisable, Then, a surprise escalade was
attempted by 2000 Maviés in Mughal pay, on 23rd January,
but the attempt failed. On {3th April two mines were fired.


--- Page 367 ---
362 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cn XVI

The first killed many of the garrison and buried the havladar
Pragii Prabhu under the debris of the wall, but he was due
out alive. The second exploded outwards; a tower was
biown up and fell upon the Mughal lroops densely assembled
at the foot of the wall for the assault; nearly two thousand
af them perished. This explosion made a breach in the wall,
90 yards wide. Some brave imperialists, notably Baji Chavan
Daflé, the son of Satva Daflé (the founder of the State of
Jath in the Bijapur district), ran up to the lop of the wall,
shouting to their comrades, “Come up! there is no enemy
here!’ But none followed them; the men in the Mughal
trenches who survived were too daged and alarmed by the
catastrophe to stir oulside. The garrison now recovered from
their surprise, and rushing up to the breach, slew the gallant
forlorn hope.

Meantime Rajaram had died (March) and his minister
Parashuram proposed submission fo the Mughals. Tarbiyat
Khan had demolished 70 yards of the fort walls, 400 of the
garrison had been killed by the mines. Considering all these
facts, Subhanji, the giladar of Satara, losl heart and made terins
with the Emperor through Prince Azam, On @ist April
he hoisted the imperial flag on his forl and vacated il with
the garrison the next day. The fort was renamed Aganmtara
in honour of Prince Md. Azam.

8 5, Pacli fort captured,

The Mughals soon afterwards opened siege trenches before
Parli, six miles west of Satara. This fort had been the seat
of Shivaji’s gure Ramdas Swami and it was serving as the
headquarters of the Maratha Government while Satara was
invested by the enemy. Patashuram, the chief revenue officer
of ihe Maratha Government, being disheartened by the death
of Rajaram and the fall of Satara, escaped from Parti, but
that fort continued its resistance under his subordinates.

1700] SUETERINGS OF MUGHAL ARMY 365

The invaders suffered terribly from excessive rain and the
scarcity of grain and fodder. But Aurangzib held grimly on.
Terms were at fast made with the qiladar of Parli, and he
evacuated the fort (on 9th June) fdr a bribe.

These two sieges hac caused an enormous waste of men,
horses and transport animals in the imperial army. The
treasury was empty, the soldiers were starving at their pay
being in arrears for three years. Heavy and unprecedented
rain began to fall early in May and continued till the end of
July. On Qist June the return march towards Bhushangarh
commenced, but the sufferings of the miserable soldiers were
only aggravated by the change. Most of the transport animals
had perished during the siege. The few cartoxen and
elephants that survived had nothing but their skins
and bones feff Only a small part of the property of the
Emperor and the nobles could be carried away by these weal
animals and porters. Much had lo be left in the forts or
burnt’ Many persons of noble birth had to walle on foot
through the mud for mife after mile. One march was followed
by two days’ halt, in order to allow the stragglers time to
come up. Only three miles were covered by a day's march,
The Krishna was in such high flood that the opposite bank
could nol be seen from this. Great difficulty was felt in
crossing such a huge army over the swollen river. Only
seven halfbroken and = clumsily-patched up boats were
available for ferrying the men across, and the people often
fought lo get seals in lhem. Bhushangarh was reached on
25th July, the army having taken 35 days to cover 45 miles f

sweeping through the river bed, overlopped its banks and
spread over the plains beyond. Many men and animals
perished; many mote, including even the nobles, were left
absolutely poor and naked; nearly all the tents and property
were damaged.

When the flood first struck the camp, a liltle before
midnight, a loud cry arose throughoul the army. The Emperor,
imagining that the Marathas had burst into the camp, rose in
alarm, but stumbled and dislocated his right knee. The doctors
failed to set it properly, and he remained a little Jame for the
rest of his life. The Court flatterers used to console him by
saving that it was the heritage of his ancestor, the world-
conqueror Timur the Lame |!

But vigorous efforis were made fo replenish his army.
Orders were sent fo the governors of Northern India to
enlist strong men and buy good horses in every province
and send them to the Decean. Two thousand horses were
bought in Kabul, and 9,000 mares locally, besides the
remounts purchased in other provinces.

The Marathas put the misfortunes of the imperialists lo the
best account In acklition to theie normal raids, Hanumant
Rao plundered the ‘Sana of Khatau and killed its Mughal
officer Ramchandra (a Maralha), 18 August, 1700. The Berad

its sister fort of Payangarh. A mobile force under Nusrat
Jang was sent out to “chastise the robbers wherever they
should raise their heads.” But in that stony region the
progress of mining was necessarily very slow, and the
dreaded rainy scason was approaching. In addition to the
notorious rivalry between lhe Emperot’s two highest generals,—
Nusrat Jang and Firuz Jang,-—which made it impossible to employ
both al the same place, there now broke out a bitter jealousy
between Tarbiyat Khan and Fathullah Khan and another
belween the older officers in general anda very able upstart
from Gujral named Muhammad Murad. The mutual jealousies
of the generals made true co-operation among them impossible.
They seeretly thwarted one another, and thus spoiled their
master’s business and prolonged the siege. When Tarbiyat
Khan was urged to deliver an assault, he ironically
replied, “The preparations for an assault are complete.
Please order Md. Murad, who has done such heroic deeds,
fo support us on the day of storming.” With this spirit
animating Aurangzib’s generals, it was only natural that all
his eHorts came fo nothing, and the siege dragged on for
two months, without success seeming to came any nearer.
To gain Panhala before the rains began, a large bribe was
paid to Trimbak, the ailadar, and he delivered the fort on
28th May, L701. The efforts of the Marathas to relieve the
siege of Panhala were many, Their generals, Dhana Jacav,
Ranuji Ghorpare, Ramchandra and Krishna Malhar constantly
hovered round the siege camp, cutting off foraging parties
and convoys of provisions. Nusrat Jang and Harnid-ud-din
with movable columns toiled in vain after the fleet Maratha
rovers and fought many a bloody battle without decisive
result,

Afler the fall of Panhala, Aurangzib (on 99th May, 1701)
retreated from it to encamp in the safer and more fertile
region of Khatau (25 miles east of Satara and on the left

bank of the Verla river). Quick as his departure was, it
had not been made soon enough. A cyclone passed over
the camp “blowing away tents and sheds like paper. Kings
and beggars had to sil down in the stin. Veiled laclies
became exposed to the public gaze.”

Fathullah Khan, highly promoted and created a Bahadur,
was sent ahead to take Wardhangarh (8 m. n. w. of Khatau)
and three other forts in the neighbourhood,—Chandan,
Nandgir and Wandan.

The Emperor next set ouf for the conquest of Khelna
(or Vishalgarh). This fort stancs thirty miles west of Pathala,
on the crest of the Sahyadri hill, 3,550 feet above the sea
and overlooking the Konkan plain lying on ifs west. The
district is wet and cool, and the hills were thickly covered
with trees ancl dense underwood in the {7th century, The
easiest means of teaching the fort is by the Amba pags, five
miles north of if, and some 35 miles n. w. of Kolhapur.

ground, There was in that age no road here for wheeled
traffic, and the ups and downs were so sharp and the path
so narrow that even horses could not use it with ease or
safety.

Leaving Wardhangarh on 7th Nov, 1701, the Emperor
arrived near Malkapur jin 12 marches. Here he halted for
a week, while pioneers were set to make a road ahead, But
the Amba pass itself had vet to be made fit for the passage of
an army. This formidable fask was accomplished by
Fathullah Khan after one weel’s incessant toil with av host
af pioneers and stone-cutters. Then Asad Khan was detached
on 26th December to .begin the siege, On 16th January

the fort.

The siege dragged on for five months Ganuary—June 1709).
During this year Nusrat Jang with his mobile division marched
in pursuil of the Maratha field forces nearly 6,000 miles in
Berar and Telingana and fought {9 great battles wilh them,
besides numberless skirmishes. The Mughal artillery beat in
vain against the solid rock of the walls of Khelna; only a
few stones were loosened from the tower, and success seemect
as far off as ever. On the other band, the catapulls of the
garrison showered huge stones upon the advancing siege-
works. They also raided the trenches al night All the
valiant exertions of Fathullah Khan Turani on the notth side
were thrown away against that impregnable rock. No better
success was achieved at the Konkani (or western) gate of the
for. Here Muhammad Amin Khan had stormed the fortified
hillock opposite this gate and commanding its fausse brave
(rauni) on 4th March. Bidar Bakhi, who replaced the Khan,
defivered an assault led by fai Singh, the young Rajah of
Amber, on 27th April, and captured the rauni, in spite of
heavy losses, The next step was fo drag big guns up to the
position and batter down the Konkani gate with them.

But the terrible monsoon of the Bombay Coast now burst
on the heads of the devotec’ Mughal army. The giladar
Parashuram accepted a large bribe from Bidar Bakht and on 4th
June planted the prince’s banner on the ramparts, and in the
night of the 7th the garrison evacuated the fort,

The sufferings of the Mughal army during its return from
Khetna were terrible. The Emperor beat a hasty retreat from its
neighbourhood, on 10th June, only three days after the fall of
the fort But the rain had already begun with tropical fury and
the Mughal army underwent terrible hardships in crossing the
dreadful Amba pass again in this weather, “The camels

of clothing left to them. Atl some slages only a small canvas
cover was all that could be pitched for the Empesor himself.
In this condition, after covering 30 miles in 38 days, the
miserable army arrived near Panhala (17 July 1709).

The Mughals finally reached Bahaclurgarh or Pedgaon on the
nothern bank of the Bhima, on [3th November, 1702,

8 8. Steges of Kondana (Singhgach), Rajgarh and Totna,

After a stay of only 18 days, the Emperor set oul on
Gnd December to capture Kondana (Singhgarh), which was
reached on the 27th. The imperial family, offices, and heavy
baggage were removed Irom the Base Camp at Islamputi to
Bahadurgarh, and the former post was made Nusrat Jan's
cantonment. Bicar Bakht was sent to Aurangabad as viceroy
and later (Feb, 1703) given the subahdari of Khandesh in
addition. The siege began, but there was no fife in the work
of the besiegers, and three months were wasted in this way.
The rainy season was now approaching, So, the Emperor's
servanis secured the fort on 8th April 1703, by heavily
bribing the qiladar,

From Kondana the army marched back to Puna in a
week ({ May), in the neighbourhood of which it spent nearly
seven months. The excessive rainfall of 1702 had been
followed by a drought in 1703-4, and there was famine
throughout Maharashtra, with its natural companion, pestilence.

1704| RAJGARH AND TORNA CAPTURED 369

Large numbers of the poorer classes perished,—-two millions,
according to Manutcei,

From the neighbourhood of Puna, the Mughal army reached
Rajgarh in 18 days, and began its siege on 2nd December,
1703. They bombarded it for two months, and then captured
the firsl gale by assault on 6th Feb. 1704. The garrison
under their chiefs Firangji and’ Hamanji retired lo the inner
citadel, and kept up the resistance for ten days more, At
last the qiladar made terms, hoisted the imperial flag on his
tower, and fled away at night (16 Feb,).

Aurangzib next laid siege to Torna, eight miles from
Rajgath, on 93rd February. In the night of 10th March
Amanullah Khan with only 23 Mavle infantry silently scaled
the fort-wall by means of rope-ladders, blew his trumpets, and
chargecl the enemy. Those of the garrison who resisted were
put io the sword, the rest fled to the citadel and cried for
mercy. This was the only Maratha fort that Aurangzib
captured by force without resort to bribery.

From Torna the imperial camp arrived at Khed (7 miles
north of Chakan) and encamped there for six months, from
17 April to 21 October, 1704, From this place the Emperor
started on 22nd October for Wagingera, the Berad capital,
which was reached after a slow march of three-and-a-half
months, on 8th February 1705, and immediately besieged.
This was the last campaign of Aturangezib.

89, The Berad people and their country and chieftain,

The country extending east of Bijapur city, and enclosed
by the Bhima and the Krishna rivers, is the home of the
Berads, a race of aboriginal Kanarese, also called Dheds, and
regarded as one of the lowesl in the scale of Hindu castes.
They are a virile and hardy people, not much advanced from
savagery, but at the same time not toned down like the over-
refined upper castes of Hindu society, They eat mutton,

beef, pork, domestic fowls, etc, and drink to excess. Dark,
muscular, and of middle height, with round faces, flat cheeks,
thin lips and lank or frigzledl hair, ihe Berads can bear fatigue
and hardship, but have no laste for settled industry or peaceful
arts, Their tribal organizalion under the heads of families and
the judicial authority of their hereditary headmen ensured
discipline and solidarity among them, and they supplied the
most steady and aceurale musketeers of South India in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Their gallantry in war
and contempt for wounds and death were as conspicuous as
their skill in making night-attacks and surprises, - which we
might naturally expect from such expert — caittle-stealers.
Contemporary Persian historians call them Be-dar (fearless), by
a play on their name.

The cradle-land of the Berads was Mysore, from which
they advanced into the Raichur doab and then further north
into the country beyond the Krishna and even the Bhima.
The Berad Nayaks or chieftains of Shorapur, lying in the
fork between the Krishna and the Bhima, had their earliest
capital at Sagar, some 72 miles casi of Bijapur cily. When
this was lost to the Mughals (1687), the Nayak built a new
capital at Wagingera, twelve miles south-west of Sagar. Al
the close of Aurangzib’s reign even this forl was taken from
him, and the Nayak removed his seat to Shorapur, on the
eastern face of the same  hill-mass as Wagingera and
four miles from it Ilaving lost their dominion jo the
Mughals at the surrender of 1687, the Berad chiefs had now
no resource left except to rebel, build new strongholds among
the hilis, and rob the Mughal territory around in wmitation
of the Marathas and afterwards in concert with them, The
Kulbarga district was kept in constant disturbance and the roads
were closed to caravans by persistent but elusive bands of
Berad horsemen for many years after the fall of Sagar,

Didia Nayak, the nephew and adopted heir of Pam Nayak,

ing Wagingera and raising an army. Ile collected twelve
jhousand excellent muskeleers of his tribesmen and _ steadily
increased his artillery and munitions of war.

Pidia’s robberies in the Kulbarga district became too serious
fo be neglected any longer. At last, on 27th May 1691 the
Emperor sent his son Kam Bakhsh from Bijapur, in charge
of Bahramand Khan, to attack Wagingera) On 0th July the
prince was sent off to the Madras Karnatak, and the operations
against the Berads were entrusted to Ruhullah Khan. The
latter could not achieve the task; the Berads twice fell
on his entrenchment and destroyed il; many on the Mughal
side were slain, including the celebrated Ranmast Khan. So
Ruhullah Khan opened negotiations with the enemy, who bribed
and lulled him into inactivity. Azam was sent to telieve Ruhullah
(8th December 1691). The prince stayed there for a year,
ravaging the country and checking Berad activities. Pidia then
submitted, appealed to the prince’s mercy, presented him with
two lakhs of Rupees and made peace with the Emperor by
paying an indemnily of seven lakhs. But in December 1699
the Emperor removed Azam from Sagar, and Pidia soon
afterwards resumed his old brigandage and usurpation of land.
When Ficuz Jang was sent against him (April 1696), he “played
the same jackal's trick on him’ and escaped destruction by
promising a tribuic of nine lakhs.

§ 10. Aurangaib captures Wagingera, 1705,

Al last, towards the close of the year 1704, after the greal
Maratha forts had all been captured, the Emperor turned fo
Wagingera and began its siege on 3th February 1705.

On the plain in the south, facing the fort gate, there is a
village called Talwargera, enclosed by a mud wall and


--- Page 377 ---
372 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB Icu, XVI

containing the markel for the supply of the garrison. Close
to it was Dhedpura, a hamlel of grass huts, where the families
of the common Berads lived and from which they filled the
surrounding lands. These three were the only inhabited places
there ; but close fo the fort in the east and north were a
nutober of hillocks which would be of great service to besiegers,
One of these, called Lal Tike from its ted soil, slightly
commanded a portion of Wagingera itself and had avery
important bearing on the defence of that fort. The Berads had
not thought of protecting any of these outlying emincnces by
redoubt or outpost.

The strength of Wasingera lay not so much in its natural
position or artificial defences, as in the courage and number
of its garrison, the deadly accuracy of their musketry fire,
and its ample supply of guns, rockets and artillery munitions.

For many weeks after the commencement of the siege,
the Mughals could do nothing. Every day the enemy  sallied
forth and attacked the imperialists. The bombardment from
the fort walls continued incessantly and made the aclvance of
the Mughal trenches, or even their maintenance within range
of the fort guns, impossible.

One morning while the Mughal generals were out reconnoi-
tring for weak points in lhe defences, they suddenly charged
up Lal Tikri, drove away the Berad musketeers on its top and
seized the position. But it was impossible for them to dig
themselves in on that rocky height. The Berads immediately
sent there large bodies of their infantry, who swarmed up
the hillside “numberless fike ants and locusls,” and plied their
muskets and hurled stones with deadly accuracy on the
impetialists crowded helplessly on the top. The position had
at last to be abandoned after heavy losses,

The Mughal trenches started frotn a spot between Lal
Tikri and the hillock opposite Talwargera, while an outpost
was established under Muhammad Amin Khan between Lal

1705| AURANGZIB'S SIEGE OF WAGINGERA 373

Tikri and these trenches, to guard against enemy allacks
from thal hill. The hillock facing Talwargera was occupied
by Kam Bakhsh’s troops and another mound near by was
held by Bagqar Khan.

But on 6th March a Maratha force of five to six
thousand horse under Dhana Jaday and Hindu Rao (brother
of Santa Ghorparé) arrived near the fort to support their
Berad allies, because the families of many Maratha generals
had taken retuge there. The first task of the Marathas was
to remove their families safely from this fort While the
main body of the new-comers kept the imperialists in play
by a noisy feint against the siege lines in front of the fort
assisted by a heavy fire from the walls, another body of
9,000 picked troopers brought their women and children out
by the back-door of Wagingera, mounted them on swift
mares, and escaped, their rear being guarded by a body of
infantry that sallied out of the fort, ‘

Didia had promised the Marathas a daily subsicy of
several thousand Rupees as long as they would assist in the
defence of his capital They halted in the neighbourhood
and made frequent atlacks on the Mughals. The Mughal
army itself was now thrown into a state of siege. Its
activities ceased and it was confined to its own lines, Grain
and fodder became extremely scarce in the catnp, Tlic
Emperor censured his generals, but it had no effect,

Pidia now made proposals of submission fo the Emperor,
but his real object was to gain lime and call up heavy
reinforcements from far and near.

Abdul Ghani, a glib-tongued fying Kashmiti pediar, one
day brought to Heclayet-kesh (the chief of the imperial
Intelligerice Department) a letter from Pidia proposing peace,
Aurangzib gave a favourable reply to the letter. Pidia next
sent his brother Som Singh to the Mughal camp, offering
fo give up the fort and asking that the zathindari, the


--- Page 379 ---
374 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB feu. XVI

headship of the clan, and a mansab might be granted to his
brother. Som Singh stayed in the camp and spread the
lale that Pidia had turned mac and fledt wilh the Marathas.
The Kashmict next brought ‘a message trom the Berad chief’s
mother repeating this story and begging thai Som Singh
might now be allowed to return as the fort would be vacated
in seven days. The Emperor agreed and slopped the fighling,

And then the bubble burst) The whole thing was a fraud.
Pidia was alive and sane and still within the fort; he refused
fo surrender it and renewed his attacks. The Emperor almost
went mad with rage and shame.

Meanwhile, he had summoned his ablest generals from all
sides. Nusrat Jang arrived on 927th March and the next day
he galloped up to the hillock of Lal Tikri from which the
Mughals had been dislodged in the early days of the siege.
He climbed the hill, and drove out the enemy, who ran into
the village of Talwargera at its foot, and began lo ply their
muskeis from behind ifs mud wall. Many Rajputs fell in the
attack on Lal Tikri and outside the village. But Nusral Jang
directed Dalpat Bundela lo a neighbouring hillock which was
stil in the enemy’s hands. The Berads fled from the second
mound foo and hid in the village of Dhedpura. On. this
day twenty-one buliels and one rocket hil Dalpat Rao’s
elephant. The banners of Nusrat Jang were pilled with shot-
holes lie a crocodile’s hide, and two of his elephant deivers
were wounded and one killech Similarly, there were heavy
casualties in the centre and rear of the Mughal general's
force, but Nusrat Jang kept hold of the position he had
gained with so much blood near the wall. A few days later
the Khan captured some wells siluated on the skicl of the
hill whence lhe enemy used to draw their water. On 27th
April he delivered an assault on Talwargera. The imperialists
entered the peff (walled village), slaying all who resisted, and
the rest fled.

RUINOUS EFFECTS OF DECCAN WARS 375

The Berads now found that further struggle was hopeless.
Pidia fled out of the backdoor at night, “with the Maratha
companions of his day of adversily.” When night came and
the sound of musketry from within died down, some Mughal
soldiers enlered the fort and found the place entirely
deserted. Then began a wild scene of confusion, rapine and
burning. At the news of the fort being vacated, there was
a wild rush of camp-followers, common soldiers and all the
raffians of the camp, in the hope of plunder before the
Government agents should come and attach the property.
The fire from the burning roofs spread to a powder magazine,
and there was a terrible explosion, many people — being
blown up. After two or three days, a second magazine
exploded. Wagingera was captured, but its chieftain had
escaped and lived to give trouble lo the victors. Thus, all
Aurangzib’s labours for these three months were lost,

§ (1. Desolation of the country caused by Aurangzib’s
wares + cntversal dtsardec.

Al the end of the 17th century the great empire founded
by Akbar and raised to world-famed prosperity and splendour
by Shah Jahan, was in a slate of hopeless decay ; aclministra-
tion, culture, economic life, military strength ane social
orvanization,—all seemed fo be hastening fo ulfer ruin and
dissolution. The material waste caused fo the empire by _ this
quarter century of warfare was frightful. The desolation of
the Decean was complete. As a contemporary European
observer, Manucci, notes,~"‘Aurangzib withdrew to Abmadnagar
leaving behind him the fields’ of these provinces devoid of
trees and bare of ctops, their place being taken by the bones
of men and beasts. Instead of verdure all is blank and
barren. There have died in his armies over a hundred
thousand souls yearly, and of animals, pack-oxen, camels,

elephants, elc, over three hundred thousand...In (he Deccan
provinces from 1702 to 1704 plague [and famine } _ prevailed.
In these two years there expired over two millions of souls.”

As he began his retreat northwards from the environs of
Wagingera, the exultant Marathas in a vast horde of 50 to
60 thousand men followed his army a few miles in the rear,
cutting off his grain supplics and stragglers and even threatening
to breale into his camp.

The eye-witness Bhimsen wriles,-~“The Marathas became
completely dominant over the whole kingdom and closed the
roads. By means of robbery they escaped from poverty
and gained great wealth. I have heard that every week
they gave away sweets and money in charily, praying
for the long life of the Emperor who had proved
lio them] the Feeder of the Universe | The price of grain
grew higher and higher; in the imperial camp in particular
vast numbers perished (of hunger), and many Rinds of illegal
exactions and practices appeared. Ever since His Majesty had
come to the throne he had not lived in a city but elected
all these wars and hard marehing, so that the inmates of his
camp, sick of long separation, summoned their families to
the camp and lived there. A new generation wags thus born

youth to old age, and passing beyond old age girt up their

Marathas invade a province they take from every pargana as
much money as they desire and make their horses eat the
slanding crops or fread them underfoot. The imperial
army that comes in pursuit can subsist only when the fields
are cultivated [anew], All administration has disappeared... The
realm has been desolated, The ryots have given up cultiva-
tion ; the jagirdars do not gel a penny from their fiefs. The


--- Page 382 ---
EFFECTS OF ADMINISTRATIVE BREAK~DOWN 377

system of the Maratha Government paying salaries to its
officials disappeared. So, the Maratha State servants suppor-
ted themselves by plundering on all sides, and paying a
small part of their booty to the king.” The effect of the
eneniy’s robbery and stoppage of rent from the Mughal
officer’s jagirs was aggravated by a long-conlinued famine.
Hence, “the condition of the Mughal army grew worse from
the high price of grain and the devastation of jagirs, while the
resources of {he Marathas increased through robbery. They even
attacked walled cities like Haidarabad, Bijapur, Aurangabad,
and Burhanpur.”

The break-down of the administration and of public peace
created a vicious circle aggravating the evil, as Bhimsen has
clearly pointed oul: “The mansabdars, on account of the
small forces under them, cannot gain control over the
fertilories granied jo them in jagir. The local zamindars,
srowing stronger, have joined the Marathas, levied troops,
and stretched =the hancd of oppression over the realim....As
the imperial dominions have been given out in tankfa (fief)
to the jagirdars, so too the Maralhas have made a distribution
of the whole empire among their generals, and thus one
kingdom has to maintain two sets of jagirdars |..The peasants
subjected jo this double exaction have collecled arms and
horses and joined the Marathas.”” Many of the Mughal
mansabdars, goaded by poverty, began to plunder the innocent
and loyal peasants to support themselves, and some went into
shares with the Maratha raicevs. :

§ 19. Maratia systems of spoltation and warfare.

The Marathas had reduced spolialion fo a syslem. “Where-
ever these raiders arrived they engaged in a revenue collection
of the place and passed months and years there with their
wives and children in peace of mind. ‘They divided the parganas
among themselves and in initation of the imperial Government

they appointed their own subahdars, Kanavishi-dacs (revenue
collectors) and rafdars (road-guarcds). Their subalicar was a
leader of troops: whenever he heard of a farge caravan
coming, he overtook il at the head of [some] seven thousand
cavalry and footed it Everywhere amavisi-dars were posted
for collecting the chautf. When a kamavish-dar was opposed
by a strong zamindar or imperial faujdar and could not levy
the blackmail, the Maratha subahdar came to his aid, besieged
and desolated the habitations there. The duty of the Maratha
tafdar was this—when traders wanted! to travel unmolested
by these people, the rahdar took a sum of money from each
cart or bullock (three or fourfold the imperial faujdar’s transit
duty}, and left the road open to them. In each sutbah the
Marathas built one or two sinall forts (gerAis), which they
made their place of refuge and from which they issued to
raid the country around.” (KGafi Khan.)

Alter {703 the Marathas were masters of the situation all
over the Decean ahd even in parts of Northern India. The
Mughal officers became helpless and reduced to the defensive.
A change now came over the Maratha tactics with this growth
of their power: they were no longer, as in Shivaji’s and
Shambhuji’s times, light forayers who “cut and ran” or merely
looted defenceless traders and villages and dispersed al the
first report of the Mughal army’s approach, On the contrary,
as Manucci noticed in 1704, “These [Maratha] leaders and
their troops move in these days with much confidence, because
they have cowed the Mughal commanders and inspired them
with fear. Al the present time they possess artillery, muskelry,
bows and arrows, with elephants and camels for all their
baggage and tents, In short they are equipped and move
about just like the armies of the Mughal.”

In the internal administration the break-down of Aurangzib’s
Government was equally conspicuous. The officials became
incorrigibly corrapt and inefficient, all the forbidden  cxactions

by his distant officials, and the administration lost its efficiency.

linmediately after the capture of Wagingera (27th Aptil,
1703), the Emperor removed his camp to Devapur, a quiet
green village near the Krishna, eight miles south of the fort,
Here he fell very ill on account of his age (ninety lunar years)
and incessant labour.

Despair seized all men in his camp. Al first he had
courageously struggled with disease, and had through sheer
strength of mind continued for some days to transact business
as usual and even to peep out of his bedroom window to
reassure the ptblic that he was alive. But the slrain of _ this
work only inereased his malady, fill he was seized with great
paiti, which al times made him senseless. The wildest rumours
spread about his death and wars among his sons.

He lay in this stale for fen or twelve days, and then he
began to tally, but slowly, and still feeling very weak. At this
lime, one day in extreme agony he muttered these verses of
Shaikh Ganja:

“By tbe lime xou Bare ceuched zout soth
ot 901i yeut,
You must Aave met with mang a Bard blow
trom the hand of Time;

And when trom that point you reach tie
stage of a fitnddved,

Death will pul on the garb of your life,"

Amir Khan, who was in attendance by the sick-bed, tried to
console the sufferer by saying, “Peace be on your Majesty!
Shaikh Ganja composed those verses merely as introductory
to the following couplet :

Then, tt ts better for you to be cheertut,
Because, being cheertul you can remember God |”

On 93rd October, 1705, Aurangaib broke ap lhe encamp-
ment at Devapur and set out northwards in a palti.
Travelling slowly by easy stages, he reached Ahmadnagar,
on 20th January 1706, after an interval of 23 years since the
day when he had started from it to begin his Neccan
conquests. This place he declared to be his ‘journey’s end.’

§$ 14. Sorrow and despair of Aurangaib’s last yeats.

The last vearsof Aurangzib’s life were unspeakably gloamy.
In ° the political sphere he found that his lifelong endeavour to
govern India justly and strongly had ended in anarchy and ,
disruption throughout the empire. A sense of unutterable
loneliness haunted the heart of Aurangzib in his oll age,
One by one all the older nobles had died oul, and the sole
personal friend and = survivor of the gencralion in which his
youth had been nurtared that was now left to him was
Asad Khan the wagir, and even he was some five years
Auranggib’s junior. As the aged monarch looked round his
Court cirele he only found on all sides younger men, timid
sycophants, afraid of responsibility, afraid to tell the truth,
and eternally intriguing in a mean spiril of personal greed
and mutual jealousy. [lis Puritan ausierily had, at all limes,
chilled the advances of other men towards hitn. Men shrank
in almost supernatural dread from one who was above the
joys and sorrows, weakness and pity of mortals, one who
seemed to have hardly any element of common humanity in
him, who lived in the world but did not seem to be of it
His sole companions, when free from the ever-engrossing
Siate affairs, were his daughter Zinat-un-nisa, already an old
maid, and his last wife Udipuri, a low animal type of partner,
whose son Kam Bakhsh broke his imperial father’s heart by
his freaks of insane folly anc passion.

1706] EVENTS OF EMPEROR'S LAST YEAR 3

His domestic life was darkened, as bereavements thickened
round his closing eyes. His best-loved daughter-in-law,
Jahanzeb Banu, died in Gujrat in Match 1705. His rebel son
Akbar had died in exile in a foreign soil in 1704. Still earlier,
his gifted daughter, the poctess Zeb-un-nisa, had ended her
days in the prison of Delhi (1702). And now Gauhar-ara
Begam, the sole survivor among his numerous brothers and
sisters, died in 1706, and the news of it dragged out of his
heart the pathetic cry, which he repealed again and again,
“She and {alone were left among Shah Jahan’s children.” Ja
May 1706, lis daughter Mihr-un-nisa and her husband [sid
Bakhsh (Mutad’s son) both died together in Delhi, and next
month Buland Alehtar, the son of Akbar. Two of his grancd-
children died shortly before his own death (1707), but his
ministers mercifully withheld the news from the sinking man.

§ 15. Jmperial dominions fiarassed by Marathas, 1706-707.

Aurangzib had left desolation and anarchy behind bim
when he set out for Ahmadnagar. But his retreat to this
city did not bring rest to his army or peace to his empire.
fn April or May 1706, a vast Maratha army under all their
great generals, appeared four miles from the imperial encamp-
ment and threatened i. Aurangzib sent Khan-i-Alam and
olher officers who succeeded after a long and severe contest
in repulsing the Marathas from the neighbourhood.

In Gujrat, a terrible disaster befell the imperialists. Inu
Mand, a former brewer of Khandesh, who had taken to highway
robbery, made a league with the Maratha generals, Inviting
Dhana Jadav and his army, he sacked the large and tich trading
centre of Baroda (Mar, 1706). Nazar Ali, the faujdar of the
place, was defeated by the Marathas and captured with his men.

Similarly, the province of Aurangabad was frequently
ravaged by the Maratha bands under Dhana Jadav and other
leaders,


--- Page 387 ---
589 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB fou. XVI

In July Maratha activity near Wagingera forced the Emperor
to detach Tarbiyat Khan to that region to punish them. Pidia
Berad, in alliance with Hindu Rao, gaincd Penu-konda, “the
key to both the Karnataks,” by bribing its Mughal qiladar,
who had been starving from his salary being lefl in arrears,
Flushed with their gain of such a fort, the Marathas turned to
Sera, the capital of Bijapuri Karnalalk Uplands, the district round
which they had plundered before, in June (704. Daud Khan,
the faujdar of Karnatak, afferwards recovered  Penu-konda.
Siadat Khan, an officer of the Court, was wounded in both
eyes by musket-shot, captured, and held to ransom by the
enemy. They also recovered Basanlgarh from the imperialists
about this time.

When the rainy season ended (Sep. £706), Maratha
activily was. renewed wilh tenfold intensity. Dhana Jadav
now made a dash for the old dominions, Berar and
Khandesh; but Nusrat Jang, leaving his camp near Miraj,
headed him off into Bijapur and thence beyond the Krishna.
A long train of caravans coming from Aurangabad to the
imperial camp was plundered of everything near Chanda,
24 m. from Ahmadnagar.

$16. Last dags of Auranyzib,

While dangers were thus thickening round Aurangzib’s
forces, the internal troubles of his camp became even more
ominous. Muhammad Azam’s inordinate vanity and ambition
utged him io secure the succession for himself, by removing
all rivals from his path. So, he poisoned the ears of the
Emperor against Azim-ush-shan, the able third son of Shah
Alam, and had fhim recalled from the government of Patna.
He also drew over lo his side the prime minister Asad Khan
and some other nobles. Then he looked oul for an opportunity
fo make a sudden attack on Kam Bakhsh and kill him.

.


--- Page 388 ---
(707| DEATH OF AURANGZIB 585

Every day Azam’s hostile designs against Kam Bakhsh became
more evident, and therefore the Emperor appointed the brave
and faithful Sultan Husain (Mir Malang) paymaster of Kam
Bakhsh’s forces, and charged him with that prinee’s defence,

Early in February 1707, Aurangzib had one more of the
attacks of languor and ill-health which had become rather
frequent of late. He recovered for a time and began once
more to hold public darbars and do business of the State.
But he felt that this fme the inevitable could not be far off,
and that the peace of his camp and the safety of the vas
host assembled there were threatened by Azam’s growing
impatience and violent ambition which might break bounds
any day, So, he appointed Kam Bakhsh subahdar of Bijapue
and sent him away with a large force to his charge on 9th
February, [our days later, (13th Feb.) Md. Azam was des-
patched to Malwa as its governor; but that cunning prince,
knowing his father's death to be very near, marched slowly,
halting every other day.

Four days after sending away the last of his sons from his
side, the aged and worn-out monarch was seized with a
severe fever ; bul for three days he obstinately insisted on
coming to the Courtroom and saying the five daily prayers
in full congregation. In these days he often reciled the couplet
of foreboding—

“In a twinkle, in ea minute, in a breath,

The condition of the world changes.”
During this lasl period he dictated two pathetic letters (see
next appendix) lo his sons Agam and Kam Bakhsh, entrealing
them lo cultivate brotherly love, peace and moderation, and
illustrating the vanity of all earthly things.

In the morning of Friday, 0th February, £707, Aurangzib
came oul of his bedroom, went through his morning prayer,
and began to count his beads and repeat the Islamic
confession of faith in the oneness of the Godhead and the

prophetship of Muhaniunad. Gradually unconsciousness crept
on, his breathing became harder and harder; but such was
the mastery of that indomitable spirit over the natural weakness
of the body that his fingers continued to tove over his
rosary and his lips to gasp out the Kalimadé, till about eight
o'clock when all was over. Ile had ever wished to die on
the Muslim Sabbath Friday, and thal prayer hacl been granted

Muhammad Azam arrived in the camp on the 22nd and
after mourning for his father and consoling his sister Zinat-un-
nisa Begam, he took part in carrying the corpse a short
distance, and then sent it away to Khuldabad near Daulatabad,
for burial in the enclosure hallowed by the earthly remains of
the saint Shaikh Zain-ucl-din.

difficult to pull together with them. You have anyhow to
conciliate them, and should employ subterfuges.

Gianri,~-The Turant people have ever been soldiers. They
are very expert in inaking charges, raids, nighlattacks and
arrests, ‘They feel no suspicion, despair or shame when
commanded to make a retreat in the very midst of a fight,
which tneans, in other words, ‘when the arrow is drawn

CHAPTER XVI
AFFAIRS OF NORTHERN INDIA.

8 1. Tftety years’ wacfare in Marwae

When the fimperor went fo the Deccan in person after
patching up a peace with the Maharana June 1681), the Rajput
war so far as Mewar was concerned was ended, but not in
respect of Marwar. The Emperor’s troops continued to hold
the chief towns and strategic points of the Rathor country, but
the Rathor patricis remained in a state of war. They
oceupied the hills and deserts and every now and then
swooped down upon the plains, cutting off convoys and
{rade caravans, capturing weakly held Mughal outposts, and
rendering the cultivation of the fields aud traffic on the roads
impossible except under the protection of the imperial
garrisons. No wonder thal famine was constantly present in
Marwar, and that the Rathor bard records that in certain
years “the sword and pestilence united to clear the land”

A generalion of time passed away in Marwar in ceaseless
conflict, captures and tecaptures. But the’ resources of the
empire were far superior to those of a small desert province
ravaged by perpetual warfare. The Rathor national opposi-
tion, therefore, would have gradually grown weaker and
finally died out through attrition, if only the Emperor had
nol been plunged into a more serious conflict in the Deccan,
which drained all his resources. The milffary situation in
Maharasiitra reacted on the situation in Jodhpur, and worked
for the ultimate success of the Rathor patriots and the
restoration of their chieftain to his ancestral throne immediately
after Aurangzib’s death.

The history of these 27 years (1681-1707) in Marwar


--- Page 397 ---
599 SHORT HISTORY OP AURANGZIB {on XVI

falls into three well-defined periods. From 168! to 1687 il was
a people’s war, because their Ring was a child and their national
leader Durgadas was absent in the Deccan, The Rathor
people fought under different caplains, group by group, with no
central authority and oo common plan of action except lo
attack the Mughals wherever they could. This desultory
warfare afforded many examples of Rathor bravery and
devotion, but its military effect was nothing mote than to keep
the Mughal garrisons in constant alarm and to male their
occupation of Marwar financially tuinous. It was rather an
advantage to the Rathors that at this stage they had no
common leader, because a pilched battle of all the torees ot
the iribe with the betler armed and better organized imperialists
would have led to their decisive defeal and prevented
them from raising their heads for a generation to come,
whereas by adopting guerilla tactics they wore oul the Mughals
and minimized the disadvantage of their own inferior numbers
and eqttipment.

The second stage of the war began in 1687, when
Durgacas returned from the Decean and Ajit Singh came
out of concealment. The success of the Rathors was at first
brilliant. Reinforced by the Hadas of Bundi, they cleared
the plains of Marwar and, sweeping onwards beyond the
limits of their awn country, raided Malpura and Pur-Mandal
(1687), and even defeated the subahdar of Ajmir (1690).
and carried their ravages into Mewat and the west
of Delhi But they could not recover their own country. In lhe
very year 1687 in which Ajit Singh and Durgadas appeared
together at the head of the national forces, an exceptionally
able and enlerprising officer named Shujact Khan became
governor of Jodhpur on behalf of the Emperor, and held
that office for 14 years, during which he sueceeded in
maintaining the Mughal hold on Marwar.

Shujaet Khan, in addition to the faujdari of Marwar, held


--- Page 398 ---
MUGHAIS OCCUPY MARWAR 393

the subahiclari of Gujrat. [He always kept his retainers up to their
full number and was prompt and quick in his movements.
Ne used to spend six months (sometimes eight) every year in
Marwar and the other six in Gujrat. Thus, he succeeded in
checking the Rathors when it came to fighting, while he also
made an understanding with them, paying them one-fourth of the
imperial custom! duties on all merchandise if they spared the
traders on the roads (1588), This was another form of the
chauth,

But) on 9 July 1704 Shujaet Khan cdhed, Prince Muhammad
Azam suceeeded him as governor of Marwar and renewed
hostilities with Ajit, and the third stage of the Rajput wat of
independence began, which after much bloodshed and many
reverses on both sides ended in the complete break-down of
the imperial policy of greed and the final recovery of Marwar
by ifs national ruling dynasty (1707).

After the Mughal oceupation of their capital and other
cies, the Rathors took refuge in the hills and out of the way
nooks; bul ihe plains lay exposed to the raids of their
roving bands ; and encounters frequently look place between
them and the army o!] occupation near one or other of these
outposls with varying success. The situation of the country
is best described in the words of fhe bard Karani-can :
“An hour before sunsel every gate of Maru was shut. The
Muslims held the strongholds, but the plains obeyed Ajit...
The roads were now impassable.”

§ 9 Duegadas again in Mavwae, 1687-1698.

Durgadas’s return from Maharashtra in 1687 greatly stimu-
lated Rathor activily, and happily just then they gained a
valuable ally. Durjan Sai Hada, the leading vassal of Bundi,
on being insulted by his chieftain Anurudh Singh ( loyal

feudatory and general of Aurangsib), armed his Rinsmen and
retainers and seized the fort of Bundi by a sudden attach.


--- Page 399 ---
304. SHORE UISTORY OF AURANGZID cu. XVI

He then came over to Marwar, tnarried a sister of Mukund
Singh Champawat (a Rathar leader), and sirengthened — the
Rathor national army with his thousancdl horsemen of the Hada
clan.

The united Rathors and Hadas, having slaughtered or
driven away most of the Mughal outposts in Marwar, made a
daring raid into the imperial dominions in the north and even
menaced the capital Delhi After his return, Durjan Sal was
killed in a baltle near Mandal.

In £690 Durgadas gained a conspicuous success; he routed
and drove back on Ajmir the new governor of that province,
Safi Khan, who had faleen post on the Marwar frontier. Ile
kept up plundering and disturbing the parts of Marwar in
Mughal occttpation and rendered the roads unsafe for
travellers. This alarming situation recalled Shujaet Khan, who
very tactfully won over many of the Rajput’ headinen (thukurs
and patiawats) and inspired them with ardour for the Emperor's
cause.

Aurangzib was anxious to get back Akbar’s daughter
Safiyat-un-nisa, who had been shellered by the Rathors ever
since her father’s flight in (681. ‘The negotiations for this
purpose which had failed in 1692 were renewed in 1694
and entrusted to the able and wise Shujaet Khan, who
employed as his intermediary in this affair the historian
Ishwardas, a Nagar Brahman of Patan (now in the Gaikwar’s
territory), formerly employed as a revenue collector (sAtgdar
or amin) in Jodhpur,

After Ishwardas had repeatedly approached Durgadas, the latter
agreed to make terms for his chieftain and himself, by giving up
Akbar’s daughter to the Emperor, Ishwardas escorted the princess
to the imperial Court, On their — arrival there, Aurangzib
immediately spoke of appointing a tutoress to give his grand-
daughter that education in the Islamic scriptures which she must
have missed so long in that uncivilized and inaccessible Hindu

Slate. Bul the Began informed him that Durgadas had been
so attentive fo her welfare that he had secured for her a
Muslim mistress from Ajmir, under whose tuition she had
already studied the Quran and commitled it to her memory.

This fact convinced the Emperor of Durgadas’s
devolion and induced him to forget all bis past offences.

The next thing was to recover Akbar’s son Buland Akhtar
from the Rathors. But in effecting this there was nearly two
years’ delay, mainly because Durgadas demanded the  restora-
tion ot Jodhpur to Ajit Singh, while Aurangzib wished to
salisfy the heir of Jaswant with only a small portion of Marwar-.

But Ajit Singh’s position was now one of distress and
despair. [le was weary of roving in the wilderness, hunted by
Mughal columns and subjected to every hardship. So, in 1698,
Durgaclas abated his demands. Ajit was pardoned by the
Bimperor and given a mansab in the imperial army, with lhe
parganas of Jhalor, Sanchod and Siwana as his jagir, of which
he was also appointed faujdar.

Durgadas conveyed Buland Akhtar to the imperial Court
then at Islampuri on the Bhima (1698), This poor royal lad
had been brought up ever since his birth among the rude
Rajput peasantry, withoul seeing any city or Court, or talking
with any cullured person. He did not even know the polished
Hindustani language. Aurangzib was shocked and his Court
was amused fo find a grandson of the Emperor who could
speak only the Rajput patois (Ra/aséfian/ boli)! Buland Akhtac
felt overcome with shyness like a country youth suddenty
brought fo a large and polished city. Moreover, he had been
taught during his life among the Rathor nationalists to regard
Aurangzib as a sort of demon and the relentless enemy of
his father anc family; and now he was being torn away
from the protectors of his boyhood and the comrades of his
youth and delivered over to that very Aurangzib. He thought
it the wisest course undet the circumstances not to open his

lips at all but fo pretend dumbness. He was, however,
gradually educated and polished, and lived to be employed in
the Court, close to the Emperor’s person, in charge of one of
the roval seals. Durgadas was rewarded by being created a
3-hazari mansabdar‘and appointed faujdar of Patan.

83. Ajit and Durgadas, 170-1707.

This reconciliation with Durgadas look place in May {698,
but in 1701-2 he was driven into rebellion a second time,
In fact, bothhe and Ajit Singh had continued to distrust the
Mughal Government and kept themselves at a suspicious
distance from the Cour. The new governor of Gujrat,
Prince Muhammad Azam Shah, was ordered by the Emperor
fo send Durgadas to the imperial camp if lie could, otherwise
to Rill him there, so that Durga might no more instigate Ajil
Singh and the other Rathors.

Muhammad Azam summoned Dureadas to wait on him
at Ahmadabad, the seal of his government Bul the arrival
of couriers in succession to hasten his visit excited the Rajputs
suspicion, which passed into alarm when he heard reports
about the prinee’s troops having been drawn up armed.
Therefore, Durgacas set fire to his tents and bagyaye and
immediately rode away towards Marwar with all his followers,
by forcecdd marches.

When Durgadas was back again in Marwar as an enemy
of the empire, Ajit Singh jomed bim in open rebellion
(1702) and made some attacks on {he Mughals. But the two
could effect nothing, The economic exhaustion of Marwar
was complete, and war-weariness hal seized te Rathor clansmen
after a quarter century of continuous guerilla lighting.
To aggravate the evil, disagreement now broke oul
between Ajii and Durgadas, of which the Emperor was not
slow to take advantage, Ajit was impatient of advice, imperious
in temper, and jealous of  Durgadas’s  well-merited

influence in the royal council and popularity among his
clansmen. This internal discord among the Rathor teaders
helped Auranggib’s designs just when all seemed ta be going
against him, and it enabled him lo keep Ajit Singh out of his
kingdom and capital for five years more.

In 1704 Auranggib, at last admitting his growing helplessness
against a sea of enemies, made a sort of peace with Ajit
by giving him Mairla as jagir. In November 1705, Durgaclas,
too, unable to maintain himself in barren independence, made
his submission io the Emperor through Prince Azam, and
was restored to his old mansab and post in Gujrat.

Next year, the last of Aurangzib’s reign, a Maratha incursion
into Gujral was followed by a crushing disaster to the Mughal
army al Ratanpur. Ajit Singh raised his head in rebellion for
the third lime, Durgadas again fled the Mughal camp and
began to act in concert with him, cadsing visings in Therad and
other places. But Prince Bidar Bakht, then in charge of Gujrat,
gent a force against Durgadas, who now fled fo the broken Koli
country, south of Surat, Aji Singh had now been in open
rebellion for some Hme. He fought Muhakam Singh of
Nagor whoa was on the Umperot’s side, at Drunera, and by
defeating him gained an increase of prestige and strength.
Just after this, news of Aurangzib’s death at Ahmadnagar arrived,
and on 7th March (707 Ajit took horse for Jodhpur, expelled
Jafar Quli (the deputy faujdar of the city), and look possession
of his father’s capital, Mairta was evacuated by Muhakam
Singh, who fled wounded to Nagor. Sojai and Pali were
regained. The fort of Jodhpur was purified with Ganges water
and fuist leaves. Durgadas’s Iife’s task was thus crowned with
Success,

soon to react on the political condition of Norlhern India,
In unvarying succession Northern India ‘continued to be annually
drained of its public money and youthful recruils, in order to
fill the ever-gaping void caused by the Deecan wars. Years
passed away, and yet the Emperor did not return to his
capital, nor did any of the princes. The rich old provinces
of the empire north of the Natmada were left in charge of
second-rate nobles with insufficient troops. At the same time,
the long caravans ol merchandise, Slate revenue, army provi-
sions, and the families and property of the nobles, so frequently
making their way to the far-off South under slender escort,
offered an irresistible temptation to robber tribes. The great
royal road leading from Delhi to Agra aml Dholpur and
thence through Malwa to the Deccan, passed directly — through
the country of the Jats, a brave strong and hardy people whose
predatory instinct can be kept in check only by the terror of
superior force.

In 1685 the opportunity created by the Emperer’s Deccan
invasion was seized by twa new leaders of the Jats, Rajaram
and Ramehchra, the petly zamindars of Sinsani and Sogar,
who were the first to train their clansmen in group organization
and open warfare. Every Jal peasant was praclised in wield-
ing the staff and the sword; they had only to be embodied
in regiments, taught to obey their captains, and supplied — with
firearms to make them into an army. As bases for their
operations, refuges for their chiefs in defeat, ancl storing places
far booty, they built several small forts (garhi) amidst their
almost trackless jungle, and strengthened them with mud
walls that could defy artillery. Then they began to raid the
king's highway and carry their depredalions up to the suburbs
of Agra.

Rajaram’s lawless activities could not be checked by Saif
Khan, the governor of Agra. The Jat gangs closed the roads
fo traffic, and plundered many villages of the district, Rajaram

soon showed even greater audaciiy, by attacking and killing
(near Dholpur) the renowned Turani warrior Aghar Khan when
on his way from Kabul to the Emperor's camp at Bijapur.
Prince Bidar Bakht was sent (in December [687), to assume
the supreme command in the Jat war.

Bul before the prince could arrive, the Jat leader committed
more alrocilies, HLarly in 1688, he attacked Mir Ibrahim of
Haidarabad (newly entitled Mahabat Khan), then marching to
his viceroyally of the Panjab. Shortly afterwards he plundered
Akbar’s tomb at Sikandra, taking away its carpets, gold and
silver vessels, lamps, &c., and damaging the building.”

Bidar Bakht, on his arrival, infused greater vigour into the
Mughal operations. In an internecine war raging between
two Rajput clans, Rajaram, who was fighting for one party,
was shot dead (4 July, 1688).

Bishun Singh Kachhwa, the new Rajah of Amber (Jaipur),
was appointed’ by the Emperor as faujdar of Mathura with a
special charge lo rool out the Jais and fake Sinsani as his own
jagir. Bidar Bakht laid siege to Sinsani. But the campaign
in the jungles of the fat country severely taxed the invading
army, which had to undergo great hardship from scarcity of
provisions ‘and water. But the besiegers held tenaciously on. A
mine was successfully fired (end of January 1690), the wall was
breached, and the Mughals stormed the fort after three hours
of stubborn opposition, the Jats losing 1500 men. On the
imperial side, 200 Mughals fell and 700 Rajputs were slain
or wounded. Next year @ist May 1691) Rajah Bishun Singh
surprised the other Jat stronghold of Sogar,

The result of these operations was that the new Jat leader
went into hiding in ‘aooks and corners’ unknown lo the

Dragging out the bones of Akbar, they threw them angrily into the Jie and burnt

imperialists, and the district enjoyed peace for some years
after. This teader was Churaman, the son of Bhajia, a brother
of Rajaram. This Churaman had a genius lor organization
and using opportunities, and sueceeded in founding a dynasty
which still rules over Bharatpur. “Ile not only increased — the
number of his soldiers, but also strengthened thent by the
addition of fusiliers (musketeers) and a loop of cavalry, whom
he shortly afterwards sel on foot ;..and having robbed many of
the ministers of the Court au the road, he attacked the royal
wardrobe and the revenue sent from the provinees.” But this
full development of Churaman’s power took place after the
death of Aurangeib. About 1704 he recovered Sinsant trom
Mughal possession. Tt was, however, wrested from the
Jats a second time on 9th Oclober (705 by Mukhtar Khan,
the goverttor of Agra, ’

85. Pahar Singh Gaur and Ris sons distuch Malwa, 1685.

Pahar Singh Gaur, a Rajput zamindar of /ndrakAd in
western Bundelkhand, was serving lhe Emperor as fauidar
of Shahabad Dhamdhera in Malwa. [fe was a man of match
less bravery and as chivalrous as he was brave, Talking the
side of Lal Singh Khichi (Chauhan) against lhe lailee’s
oppressive overlord, Anurudh Singh Hada (the Rajah of
Bundi), Pahar Singh defeated the Bundi Rajah and
plundered all his camp and baggage, worlh lakhs of
Rupees, (early in 1685). Tle then openly broke with the
imperial Government, and took to plundering the villages of
Malwa. At this time that province was being aduninistered,
in the absence of Prince Muhammad Azam, by Rai Muluk
Chand, the assistant (nesfdasf) lo his diwan. He attacked and
slew the rebel (Dec. 1685). Bul the rising continued under
Pahar Singh’s son Bhagwant, who collected a large body of
fierce peasants and began to plunder the country round
Gwaligr, entirely closing the roads to traffic. Muluk Chand

marched against him with his troops. A pitched battle was
fought near Antri, in which the imperialists broke and fled ;
bul the Gaur soldiers plundered all the baggage, horses, etc.,
of the Mughals, and returned to their base to secure the booty,
and Bhagwant Singh, who was thus left almost alone in the
field, was killed by some Mughal officers, (March 1686).

But the trouble did not end even then. Devi Singh, another
son of Pahar Singh, joined Chhatra Sal Bundela, ‘and took
to plundering the imperial tertitory and molesting the people
in Bundelkhand. In 1690, Gopal Singh, the grandson of
Pahar Singh, assembled a large army and = caplured
the fort of Jndtakhi, belonging to Bakhtawar of the Bhadauria
clan. Safdar Khan, the faujdar of Gwalior, was killed during
an attacle on these rebels (May 1690).

But two years later the Gaur rebels submitted to the
Emperor and we find them serving in bis army.

$ 6. Gangaram’s rising in Biftar ; Gopal Singh's in Malwa.

Gangaram, a poor Nagar Brahman of Gujrat, was diwan
of Khan-i-Jahan Bahadur, and managed his estates (/agirs) in
Allahabad and Bihar, while ihe Khan was serving in the
Decean. The sudden rise of this obscure Hindu excited the
jealous hate of the other servants of the Khan, who had been
displaced from his favour; and they poisoned his ears against
his absent diwan, by charging bim with a design for indepen-
denee and  self-aggrandizement The Khan summoned the
diwan lo his presence. Gangaram, disgusted with such a light-
‘minded master and despairing of his life and honour, flew to
arms. Collecting some four thousand soldiers, he plundered
the city of Bihar and advancing laid siege to Patna. The rebel
set up a bogus Prince Akbar and called upon the people to
rally round his standard, (March 168{). But he had neither
the skill nor ihe material necessary for iaking a walled city, and

96

turned to the more profitable work of plundering the  neigh-
bouring villages, while the governor shut himself up in the
fort. At Jengtlh imperial reinforcements arrived from Dacca
and Benares and raised the siege of Patna. Aficr some time
Gangaram entered Malwa and iu concert with Rajput rebels
plundered Sironj, (Oct. 1684). He died shortly afterwards at
Ujjain.

Rao Gopal Singh Chandawat, the zamindar of Ramputa
in Malwa, was serving in the Emperor’s army in the Deecan.
He had sent his son Ratan Singh home to manage his affairs,
This wicked youth became a convert to Islam, and thus secured
from the Emperor the grant of his anceslral cslate, which was
newly named /slampura | At the news of it, Gopal Singh
left the Mughal army, returned home, and tried to raise a body
of men for recovering Rampura (June (700). But the Malwa
governors forces repulsed him. At last Gopal Singh in
despair made his submission to the imperor, and was appointed
faujdar of Kaulas (in Haidarabad), Early in 1706, he again
fell into extreme poverty on his being deprived of the
faujdari of Kaulas. He then joined the Marathas for a living,
and accompanied them in the sack of Baroda in the month of
March in that year.

8 7. English trade with Bengal.

The English nation established their first trade factory at
Surat in 16012 and exchanged goods with Agra and Delhi by
the land route. From Agra attempts were made in 1690 and
1632 to open up trade at Patna in Bihar, but the cost of land
transport from Surat was prohibitive, especially for bulky
goods like saltpetre, and this project was wisely abandoned.
There was also an agency at Masulipatam, a port of the
Golkonda kingdom,

In 1635 an English factory was opened at Balasore and
another at Hariharpur, 26 miles south-east of Cutlack. A litte

GROWTH OF THE ENGLISH FACTORIES 403

later, in 1640, the building of Fort St. George was begun
at Madras, on a piece of land bought from a Hindu Rajah of
fhe Vijaynagar dynasty, and thus “the English established
iheir first. independent station in India.” It lay, however,
outside the Mughal empire. In 1654 the English opened their
first commercial house in Bengal at Hughli on the Ganges, 24
miles north of Calcutta. Their chief exports were saltpelre
(brought down in boats from Singhia or Lalganj, north of
Patna), sille and sugar, Prince Shuja, then governor of Bengal,
granted a nishan (or prince’s order) by which the English were
allowed to trade in Bengal on payment of Rs, 3,000 a year
in lieu of all kinds of customs and dues (1652), Balasore
continued for several years as the place for loading and
unloading Europe-going ships.

In 1658 the Home authorities reorganized the English
establishments in India. Alt the Company’s factories were to
be subordinate {o the President and Council of Surat, besides
which there were to be chief agencies at Macras and Hughli.

The trade with Bengal was very prosperous about 1648,
Raw silk was abundant; the taffetas were various and fine:
the saltpetre was cheap and of the best quality; the gold and
silver sent from England were eagerly taken up by the
Inclians.

In 1661 further changes wee made in the government of
the English factories in India ; all the Bengal establishments
were made subordinate to the Presidency of Madras, which
now became of equal rank with Surat. The Bengal trade
continued to grow rapidly: in 1668 the Company exported
from the province goods worth £34,000, in 1675 the value
rose to £85,000, in 1677 to £100,000, and in 1680 to £150,000.
Subordinate factories were opened at Dacca in 1668, and at
Malda in 1676. In addition to buying local manufactures,
the English sent out European dyers to Bengal to improve the
colour of the silk cloth bought locally, and they also

inaugurated the Bengal Pilot Service for navigating the
Ganges from Hughli to the sea (1668), ‘The first British ship
sailed up the Ganges from the Bay of Bengal in 1679,

$8. Friction between ihe English leaders and the Muyhat
oficials in Bengal.

In the meantime, the differences between the English traders
and the local Mughal officers on account of the illegal
exactions and obstructions of the latter had come to a head,
The local officials at [fughli continued to stop the Company's
boats and seize their goods. In vain agent Iledges offered
to Shaista Khan farge sums of money in order to be excused
the payment of customs, At fast the English lraders fost al}
patience and decided to protect themselves by force, break
with the Indian rulers, and seize and fortify some convenient
place on the Indian coas! where their trade would be safe
from molestation, This war actually broke out in (686,

The complaints of the English traders against the local
agents of the Mughal Government were three :

(i) The demand of an ad valorem duty on the actual
merchandise imported, instead of the lump sum of Rs. 3,000
per annum info which it had been commuted during the
viceroyalty of Prince Shuja, and also {he enhancement of the
rate of duty from time to lime. The English also claimed
that Aurangzib’s farman of 15th March 1680 entitled them, on
the payment of a consolidated duty of 3/2 p. c at Surat, to
import goods and to trade absolutely free of customs and
other exactions at all offer places in the Mughal empire,

(i Exactions by local officers under the name of rafdari
{road patrol. «charge or internal transit duty), presents
(peshikash), wriler's fee, and farmaish (supplying manufactures
to order of the governor, for which it was nol customary fo
fake the price).


--- Page 410 ---
1686] ENGLISH TRADE HOW MOLESTED 405

(#7) The practice of high officials (such as Shaista Khan
and Prince Azim-ush-shan, subahdars of Bengal),~a practice
sometimes resoried fo by local faujdars also—to open the
packages of goods in transit and take away articles at prices
capriciously fixed by them far below the fait market price.
Some governors (notably Azim-ush-shan) tried fo enrich
themselves by seizing goods at low prices and then selling
fhem in the markef at normal prices,—a practice called
sauda-in~ffhas.

On 10th April 1665 Aurangzib issued an order that in
all provinces there would be two uniform rates of custom
duty on imports in future, namely 24/2 p. c. for Muslims and
5 p. c for Hindus, The Mughal Government seems to have
found it difficult to assess and levy the jaz/ya per head
from the Europeans in the same manner as from the
Hindus, and consequently if seems fo have offered them,
(March 1680) a compromise by turning the jagztya into an
addition to the import duty on their goods, raising the fatter
jo Be the

The claims of the English in Bengal (a) to escape the duty
on the actual value of their imports by a fixed annual payment
of Rs, 3,000 (as conceded by Shuja in 1652) and (4) to trade
absolutely free in all other parts of India on payment of
customs al Surat (in virtue of Auranggib’s feratan of 1680), are
both false and indefensible on any reasoning.

Shuja was merely a provincial governor. He could, as
he pleased, Ict off some favoured body of merchants on easy
terms during his own viceroyalty, but his grant (nisfian) could
not bind his successors in office, unless it was confirmed by
the Emperor and turned into an imperial charter (farman).
The English interprelation of Aurangzib’s farman of 1680
was equally wrong, Payment of duty on the goods landed
al Surat could, by no exercise of ingenuity, exempt from duty
a different cargo that had come from Home or China not

406 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cu. XVII

through Surat but directly fo Bengal, and which, therefore,
could not have paid any duty at Surat.

As for the second and third grievances of the English, we
must remark that the exactions here complained ot
had been declared illegal by Aurangsib and were practised
only in disregard of his orders. Rafdaci had been abolished
in the second year of his reign, while “benevolences” and
forced presents werc condemned in the general — order
abolishing abwads issued on 29th April 1673. The “forcing of
goods” by his grandson Azim-ush-shan for his private trade,
called forth Aurangzib’s sternest censures when it was brought
to his ears (about 1703). But the traders thus wrongeil
by the local officers could have redress on those rare
occasions only when their cries reached the ears of the old
Emperor in the far off Deccan, and the redress was merely
an order on paper,

Purity of administration was impossible in a society devoid
of public spirit and accustomed to submit helplessly to every
man in power, in public life as well as private. The Emperor
could not look to everything ; he could uot be present every~
where; he had to act through agents, and these did not
share his integrity and regard for his subjects.

89. The English war with Aurangath in Bengal, 1686-1689.

The Indian merchants and brokers employed by the EL f
Co. at Qasimbazar (Bengal) made a large claim agains! Job
Charnock, the chief of the factory there, and his colleagues.
The Indian judge of the place decreed the sum of Rs. 43,000
against the Englishmen ({68¢-85), As Charnoclt refused to
comply with the order, his factory was invested by Mughal troops
(August 1685). But in April nexi, he escaped to Hughli and
took the chief direction of English affairs in Bengal. The war
began in six months’ time from this.

1686 | ENGLISH MAKE WAR IN BENGAL 407

On 28th Oct 1686, three English soldiers, in trying ta
enter ihe market of the Mughal town of Hughli in defiance
of the order of the local faujdar, were wounded and = carried
prisoner to the faujdar, An advance made by Captain Leslie
from the English factory (near Golghat) to rescue them was
beaten back with loss, and the thatched huts surrounding the
English factory were set on fite to arrest their progress.
But reinforcements soon arrived from the English camp three
miles down the river, and advanced, sacking and burning the
faujcar’s house and the town lying beyond it In the evening
the English ships came abreast of Hughli, captured a ship of
the Mrghal’s, and “kept firing and battering most part of the
night and next cay, burning and plundering all they met with.”
The faujdar fled away in disguise; on the Indian side sixty
soldiers were killed and four or five hundred houses burnt
down together wilh a great number of barges and boats.

Shaista Khan, on hearing of the sack of Hughli by the
English, decided to erush these disturbers of public peace.
Vast detachments of cavalry were sent to Hughli and the
English factors at Patna were ordered to be seized. On 20th
December, the English withdrew from Hughli with all their
property, and falling 24 miles down the river halted at
Sutanati (modern Calcutta),

The war was renewed in February 1687. The English
burnt down the imperial sali-warchouses near Matiaburuj and
then stocmed the forts at Thana (modern Garden Reach,
south-west of Calettta). Sailing down the river they  seizect
the island of Hijli, on the east coast of the Medinipur district
(Contai sub-ciyision),~-a swamp of deadly malaria, but rich
in fruils, corn and game, and the seat of salt manufacture by
evaporating sea-water. Here all the English land and sea
forces in the Bay of Bengal were assembled. Next March a
body of 170 English soldiers and sailors landed at Balasore,
took the Mughal fort, and burnt the two towns called Old

408 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB lon. XVII

and New Balasore, after footing them for lwo days. The
Indian shipping in the docks were burnt, and two vessels
belonging lo Prince Agam and Shaista Khan were seized as
prizes.

About the middle of May 1687, Abdus Samad, a ficutenant
of Shaista Khan, arrived before Hijli wilh 12,000 men to expel
the English. The invaders had been daily losing men from
disease, both on land and in the ships, during the — trying
months of March and April, and their provisions had now
run very short. Their fosses in the meantime had been terrible:
900 soldiers had perished and only a hunered, weakened by
fever, survived; the forty officers had sunk fo five only, On
itth June ihe English evacuated Hijli forl, carrying off alt
their ammunilion and artillery, their drums beating and their
banners flying. On J6th August Shaista Khan issued a lteter
in which he rebuked the English for their recent acts of
violence, but permitted them to build a fort at Uluberia (about
90 miles south of Calcutta) and renew their trade at Tfughli.
So, Charnock returned with his shins and halted at Sutanati
(September 1687).

Next year Captain Heath arrived from England, replacing
Charnock as Agent in Bengal. The new chief decided to
withdraw from Bengal proper, and on 8lh November 1688
sailed away from Sutanati with all ihe men and property of
the Company. Sailing to Balasore with 300 soldiers, Captain
Ileath, on 29th November, stormed the Mughal fortification
(called Point of Sand) at the easternmosl point of Old
Balasore, capturing its artillery and stores. Next day he seized
New Balasore (further inland, to the west) and committed great
excesses, ill-treating Christians and non-Christians, men anct
women alike. Arriving before Chatgaon about [8th January
1689, he planned to wrest that fort from the Mughal officers
and make it the safe and independent base desired by the
English for their trade in Bengal. A council of war disstiaded

him from this mad project, and at last in utter disgust Health
sailed away for Madras (17th Feb), abandoning all his Bengal
projects,

The Emperor, on hearing of these acts of hostility, had
immediately ordered the arrest of all the Englishmen, the
occupation of their factories all over his daminions, and the
prohibition of all trade or other intercourse with them. But the
English were supreme at sea, and could slop the journey of
pilgrim-ships to Mecca. The floss to his customs revenue
through the stoppage of their lrade was also serious. Therefore,
afier a time he was inclined to come to ierms with them.
Ibrahim Khan, who came to Bengal as subahdar in May
1589, was a mild and just man, friendly to the English. He
wrote lo Madras inviting the factors lo return to Bengal.
At last in February 1690, peace was finally concluded
between the Mughal Government and the English on the West
Coast. As Aurangzib wrole on 22nd Feb. 1690, “The English
(of Surat] having made a most humble, submissive petition..and
[promised] thal ihey would present the Emperor with a fine
of Rs. {50,000..and behave themselves no more in sucha
shameful manner,..His Majesty hath pardoned their faults and
agrees,.that they follow their fade as in former times.” After

ihe 83rd April following, to let the English trade freely in
Bengal as formerly, without giving them any further
trouble.

8 10. English war with the Mugals on the West Coast.

As in Bengal, so also on the Western Coast of India, the
English traders suffered from the vexatious and illegal  inter-
ference and greed of the local officers of the Mughal Govern-
ment, which the Emperor could not check. In addition, they
were in 1680 asked to pay the jagiya in the form of one pe,
addilional import duty, which would have amounted to
Rs. 20,000 annually. The friction continued ; the local agents of
the E. IL Co. were powerless to find a remedy.

But Sir Josiah Child, the Chairman of the Company in
London, was a man of a fiery disposilion and exceptional force
of character. He decided on a policy of firmness, indepen~
dence, and if necessary of reprisal, against lhe Mughal empire.
Such a policy required three things, namely (a) the withdrawal
of the English factory from Surat, which was really a “fool's
paradise,” (2) concentrating the Company’s trade and officers
in Bombay as “the Key of India,” in order to be free from the
intolerable restraints and indignities to which the Company’s
servanis were subjectecl at Surat, and (co) seizing the Indian
shipping at sca in retaliation for the oppression done to English
trade in the Mughal dominions.

Bat Sir John Child, the “General and Director in Chief”
of all the Company’s factories in India, was weak and incampe-
tent. In obedience {o orders fram Home, he left Surat
for Bombay on 25th April 1687, in order to be beyond
the reach of the Mughals. The imperial governor of Surat,
faking this to be a preparation for war, put troops round
the English factory, wilh the effect that Benjamin Harris, the
chief of the Surat Council, and Samuel Annesley, his second
in office, could not go outside.

At last, on 9th October 1688, Sir John Child appeared
with a fleet before Swally and sent to the governor of Surat
a list of the grievances of the English, demanding compensa-

tion for past injuries and a new charter confirming and
extending their privileges. The governor began open hostility
by suddenly imprisoning the English factors and their Indian
brokers, placing a guard over the English factory, and sending
a force to Swally to seize Child. The latter escaped, and
retaliated by blockading the mouth of the river below Surat
and then sailing down the coast and capturing all sorts of
indian shipping indiscriminately.

The Mughal Government's reply was to put the captive
Englishmen at Surat in irons, in which deplorable condition
they remained for {6 months (Dec. 1688—April 1690). Al the
same time, the Siddi of Janfira, as Mughal admiral, delivered
an attack on Bombay (May 1689) and landed on the island,
occupying its outlying part. The English garrison was driven
within Bombay fort and besieged there by a daily increasing
mob of Muslims. Governor Child, therefore, made an abject
appeal for pardon, sending a mission lo Aurangsib under
G. Welton and Abraham Navarro (Oth Dec. 1689). The
Emperor pardoned them, by an order dated 25th December
1689, The English were restored to their old position in the
Indian trade on condition of paying a fine of one-and-a half
fazhs of Rupees, and restoring the goods taken from Indian
ships.

European piracy in the Indian Ocean had begun with

ft excited no moral reprobation in Christendom. Merchants
and advenlurers of all classes and nationalities flocked from
Furope to the Indian seas in the {6th and 17th centuries,
and with the growth of Indian trade there was a corresponding
growth of piracy by different nations.

In 1635, Cobb, the captain of a ship licensed by ‘Charles I
of England, plundered two Mughal vessels at the mouth of

the Red Sea, though one of them had a pass from the
Surat factory, In 1638, Sir William Courten, under a grant
from the same king, sent out four ships which robbed Indian
vessels and tortured their crews. For these misdeeds of
their fellow-countrymen, {he innocent servants of the E. 1 Co.
at Surat were kept in prison for two months, and released
only on the payment of Rs, 1,70,000 as compensation.

In the second half of the 17th century an even more
lawless race of men than the old Buccaneers appeared and
extended their operations to the Indian Ocean, acting generally
in single ships and plundering vessels of every nationality.
“Of these men, chiefly English, the most notorious were
Teach, Evory, Kidd, Roberts, England and Tew, with many
others less known to fame.....Roberts alone was credited with
the destruction of 400 trading vessels in three years... The
chief cause of their immunity lay in the fact that it was the
business of nobody in particular to act against them....,.. Their
friends on shore supplied their wants and gave ihem timely
information of rich prizes to be looked for, or armed ships
fo be avoided. Officials high in authority winked at their
doings, from which they drew a profit....Not only were the
greater number of pirates of English blood, but pirate captains
of other nationalities often sailed under English colours.
The native officials, unable to distinguish the rogues from the
honest tracers, held the E. [. Co.’s servants responsible for
their misdeeds.”

In 1681 two ships under English colours seized vessels
in the Red Sea worth six lakhs of Rupees, Next year a
number of sea-rovers from the West Indies made their
appearance and infesled the Malabar coast, hoisted the rect
or black flag, and robbed Indian and European vessels
alike. There were, besides, other European pirates
in the Persian Gulf, at the mouth of the Red Sea, in the
Mozambique Channel, and some lying off Achen (Sumatra),

1695 | PIRACY ON ‘Il GANJ-I-SAWAl 413

The most famous of these pirates was Henry Bridgman,
who took the alias of Evory. On 30th May 1694, while
acting as the mate of an English ship hired by the Spanish
Government, he overpowered the officers, renamed his ship
Fancy, and took to a life of piracy, with 46 suns and 1450
fighters on board, After notable captures in the Gulf of
Aden, he took off Socotra Gep. 1695) the Fath Dfuhammadi,
a tichly laden ship of Abdul Ghafur, the prince of Surat
merchants, A few days later he achieved his crowning feat,
the capture of the Ganj-i-sawai, a ship belonging fo the
Mughal Emperor and being the largest vessel of the port of
Sural. Every year it used to sail lo Mokha and Jidda, carrying
Indian pilgrims for Meeca and Indian goods for sale in Arabia.
Tt had 80 guns and 400 maskets on board, but its captain,
Muhammad Ibrahim, was a coward.

fle was returning from Mokha, when between Bambay and
Daman he was attacked by the Fancy, a second pirate ship
and lwo boats. The artillery fire of the Europeans was most
effective ; in a shorl time the Mughal vessel hac lost 95
soldiers killed and 20 wounded. A gun on board the Gary-i-
sawai bursl, setling the ship on fire and killing or burning
several of the erew. While the Incians were distracted by the
fire and engaged in putting it out, the pirates boarded the ship
from all sides. No resistance was made by the crew. The
captain hid himself in a lower cabin, after placing swords in
the hands of the Turkish slave-girls whom he had purchased
al Mokha and whom he now bade lo fight like men !

For three days the pirates looted the ship at leisure ; the
women on board, many of them belonging to the Sayyid and
other respectable families, were outraged, and several of these
victims committed suicide. Then Evory left the unhappy ship,
which was carried by its crew to Surat on 12lh September.
When iis passengers, stripped of everything, unfolded the tale
of plunder and rape, the people of Surat were roused to


--- Page 419 ---
4i4 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB cn. XVII

uncontrollable indignation at this outrage on fhe Muslim — faith.
The sufferers ascribed the attack to Englishmen closely connected
with Bombay.

Itimad Khan, the governor of Surat, was a friend of the
English and an officer of unrivalled uprightness and purity,
Amidst the popular clamour he Rept his head, and by his
judicious measures saved the local Englishmen from being
lynched by the Muslim fanatics. He sent a party of regular
troops tnder his lieulenant Ashur Beg to occupy the factory
(14 Sep.), and confine the merchants there pending the receipt
of the Emperor's orders. A similar fate overtook the English
traders at Swally and Broach. Their trade was totally
stopped.

During his captivity, Annesley (the President of the
English Council at Surat) with tireless activity sent off petitions
to the Surat governor, to the agents and friends of the
English in Aurangzib’s camp, and fo the Emperor himself and
his ministers—asserting the innocence of the Company's
servants and demanding their release. Sir John Gayer, the
governor of Bonbay, was equally active ; he wrote to Itimad
Khan and to the Emperor, strongly protesting against the
atrest of his countrymen and appealing for justice. “We are
merchants and not pirates,” he repeated.

§ 19. Aurangsib’s policy towards European traders.

Aurangzib deeply resented this flagrant offence against his
flag and his religion, bul he was too wise a man to be swayed
by his passions, Ne desired above all things to secure a regular
escort of European war-vessels for the pilgrim-ships to Mecca,
and this embargo on European trade was only an instrument
for putting pressure on them to gain that end cheaply but
effectually.

The Dutch offered to clear the Indian seas of the pirates
and to be responsible for the safely of the pilgrims to Arabia

if they were given the exclusive right of trading in the Mughal
empire free of duty. This was declined by the Emperor.
Annesley wrote to the Mughal Government undertaking to
supply convoy for the Indian vessels in the Arabian Sea or
stand responsible for their safety, on condition of the English
being paid four lakhs of Rupees annually. The Emperor
higgled hard over the amount to be paid for each escorting
ship, offering only half the actual running cost for the double
vovage. At last Aunesiey signed a bond for supplying escort, and
the English prisoners were set at liberty on 27th June, 1696,

In 1696 a syndicate of English noblemen had fitted out
the Adventure, a very strong 30-gun vessel, to act as a privateer
against the French anc at the same time destroy the pirates
in the Indian Ocean. Is captain was William Kidd, “destined
to blossom into the most redoubtable pirate who ever
besmirched the honour of England,” Arriving off Calicut early in
1697, he took to a life of piracy, shamelessly describing his
robberies as legitimate acts of privateering authorized by the
king of England. Kidd’s success drew many restless English
scamen into his party. “Distributing his forces with the — skilf
of a sea-strategist,” Captain Kidd dominated the Indian Ocean,
with his munitions and stores drawn from a base in Madagascar.
“All told, the pirate fleet mounted 180 guns, and was
manned by not less than 300 Europeans, of whom the great
majority were Englishmen.”

Besides taking many of ithe E. 1 Co.'s ships, he captured
on @nd February 1698, the Queda Merchani, 400 tons, bound
from Bengal fo Surat with a rich cargo worth 4 lakhs of
Rupees belonging to Mukhlis Khan, one of the great nobles of
the empire. Late in 1698 Chivers (a Dutch pirate) captured
a fine ship with a cargo worth 14 lakhs belonging to Hasan
Hamidan, a merchant of Jidda and Surat.

The English merchants of Surat could not escape any
longer. The wise and upright collector of the port, Itimad

Khan, had died in Feb. 1697 and had been succeeded by
Amanat Khan, an unscrupulous and rapacious tyrant. “It was
useless to assert that the English were nol to be identified
with the pirates, when... many English scamen of the piratical
crafl were actually recognized by reliable native sailors as
former servants of the E, 1 Co.” The Mughal governor, on
93rd Dec. 1698, sutrounded the Surat factory and gave
Annesley the ultimatum either fo yield to the Emperor’s demand
for giving a bond to guard the sea against pirates or to
leave the country in ten days. The Dutch and the French
were similarly treated. Meantime the factories were seercgated,
and Indians who tried to communicate with them were bound
and flogged by order of the governor. In August (698
eame an imperial order that the English, French and Dutch
would be held responsible for all losses al sea and that the
three nations should pay total damages amounting to {4 lakhs.

Finally, the English, [french and Dutch agreed to act in
concert fo suppress piracy and signed bonds by which they
fointlg engaged ta make good all future losses. On receiving
this agreement, Aurangzib reversed his embargo on European
trade in the Mughal dominions, and he wrote to the Surat
governor to setile ihe malter in his own way. In the terms
of this agreement. “the Dutch convoyed the Mecca pilgrims
and patrolled the entrance to the Rec Sea, besides paving
Rs. 70,000 to the governor of Surat; the English paid
Rs. 30,000 and patrolled the South Indian seas, while the
French made a similar payment ard policed the Persian Gulf.”

On 8th April 1699 a new English Company was established
al Surat, with Sir Nicholas Waite as President. Sir William
Norris was sent out from England as ithe English king's
ambassador to the Mughal Court in the interesis of the new
Company. He visited Aurangzib in the siege camp before
Panhala (April 1701); there was an exchange of presents
between the lwo Governments, but nothing was secured by

the ambassador in return for. his very expensive mission and
wasie of sixteen months (97 Jan. 1761-18 April 1709),
Aurangzib had demanded, as the ptice of a faeman for the
new Company's factories, that the English should give an
undertaking to clear the seas of the pirates, while Nortis
knew it to be an impossible task,

Meantime, in February 1701, Sir John Gayer had been
seized and imprisoned by Amanat Khan at Surat, through the
machinations of Waite, who had procured an order from
Aurangzib to that effect by bribing the Surat news-writer. Door
Gaycr was kept in confinement for six years with only
occasional inlervals of liberty. A return prepared in January
(702 showed that the captives at Surat numbered 109 persons,
including 21 English officials of the Company...and 15 seamen.
Their imprisonment varied in rigour according to the caprice
of the governor,

On 28th August 1703 two ships of Surat, one belonging
to Abdul Ghafur and another io Qasimbhai, when returning
from Mokha were captured by the pirates off Surat. The news
of the outrage reached Surat on the 3st, and the governor,
Itibar Khan, seized all the Indian brokers of the European
Companies, and blockaded their factories, cutiing off their food
stipply and every kind of communication with outside. Three
lakhs of Rupees were extorted by the governor from
Vittal ancl Keshav Parekh, the brokers of the old English
Company, and three lakhs more from the brokers of the
Dutch. In this the governor had merely enforced the
indemnitybond which his predecessor Amanat Khan had
extorted from the Europeans in February 1699 to the effect
that they would stand security for any losses caused to
Indian shipping by the pirates. Aurangzib, on hearing of it,
disapproved of Ifibar Khan’s action and set aside the agreement

extorled in February 1699.
But in truth there was no peace for the Europeans. The

captivity of Sir John Gayer and his Council continued with
the usual relaxations, under fresh orders from the Mughal
Court in July 1704. The Dutch made reprisals by capluring
a rich vessel bringing Indian pilgrims back from Mecca.
Among them were Nur-ul-Haq (a son of the late Chief Qazi
Abdul Wahab) and Pakhr-ul-Islam. Both were held in high
veneration by Aurangzib for sanclity of character and
respectable birth. “Without ill-treating them, the captors sent
a message to the governor of Sural calling on him to repay
the money he had faken from them by force. On being paid,
they would resiore the ships.” Aurangzib al last realized how
helpless he was at sea and that he must make an unconditional
surrender to the Europeans if his subjects were ever to make
pilgrimages to Mecca. He instructed Nejfabat Khan to secure
the release of these two holy men and the other captives on
any ferms that he could get, and forbade him to take
indemnitybonds from the Europeans in future,

SOMID PROVINCES DURING AURANGZIB’S REIGN.

84. Bengal: ts natural wealth and growth under
Mughal peace.

Among all the provinces” of the Mughal empire, Bengal
was most lavishly favoured by Nature. Its copious rainfall
makes the labour of artificial irrigation unnecessary. Its
numberless rivers and tanks with their abundance of fish and
its fruitladen orchards tichiy supplement the corn-fields, The
climate alone is vile and justifies Aurangzib’s epigram that this
province was “sy hell full of bread’ Such a country needed
only peace to be full of wealth and population. That peace
and good government were supplied to Bengal by the
Mughal empire throughout the 17th century.

In the {6th century Bengal had been an unhappy scene
of anatehy and desolation from the decay and dismemberment
of its independent provincial sultanate and the long wars of
Mughal conquest. The misery of the people was extreme,
from the annihilation of wealth and culture through political
turmoil. In the midst of this internal decay and exhaustion
of the old order, its conquest by Akbar came as a blessing
to the province. But during Akbar’s reign Mughal rule in
Bensal was more like an armed occupation than a settled
administration. His viceroys had to content themselves with
the nominal submission of the old independent Afghan
princelings and Hindu ruling gamindars. The Emperor's

subahdars merely received the tribute, but did not establish
direct imperial administration over the people, except in the
district round the capital and the strategic cities held by their
assistants, the faujdars. The huge though irregular armed
forces under the various zamindars remained quiescent but
undestroyed. They only waited for some weakening of the
Emperor's power, some catastrophe at Delhi, to assert their
independence once again. After the accession of Jahangir
his new viceroy, Islam Khan, who governed the province for
six years (May 1608-—11 August 1615), was a most ambitious,
aclive and high-spirited noble. By a series of campaigns he
erushed all the independent zamindars of Bengal, destroyed
the last remnant of Afghan power in Mymensingh, Sythet
and Orissa, and imposed full Mughal peace and direcl
imperial administration upon all the parts of Bengal. There-
after Bengal enjoyed profound internal peace for nearly a
century and a half and recovered weallh and population,
trade expanded by rapid strides, industries developed, and a
great indigenous literature grew up in the hands of the
Vaishnav sect. The Arracanesc, and stbsequently their agents,
the Portuguese pirates of Chatgaon, were a pest to the
riverside districts of East Bengal; but this evil was removed
early in Aurangzib’s reign (1666) by Shaista Khan; the trade
of the English and the Dutch grow by leaps and bounds
from the middle of the century onwards, and their factories
and purchase-agencies stimulated production anc wealth in
the country.

8 2. Governors of Bengal in Aurangsxib’s reign.
Shaisia Khan's first viceroyalty of Bengal extended over 14
years (1664-1677). During this unusually long period of office
in one province, he first ensured the safety of the Bengal
rivers and seaboard by destroying the pirates’ est at
Chatgaon, won over the Feringi pirates and settled them near

Dacca. His internal administration was equally mild and
beneficent. [fle immediately stopped the resumption by the
Stale of the old rent-free lands which the local officers had
begun during the inlerregnum following Mir Jumla’s death.

Every day he held open Court for administering justice
and redressed wrongs very promptly. This he regarded as
his most important duty. Shaista Khan restored absolute
freedom of buying and selling, and also abolished two illegal
exactions of his predecessors, namely, a tax of one-fortieth
(zakat) on the income of merchants and travellers, and an
excise duty (Aasi/) from every class of  artificers and
lradesmen, the flatter tax yielding 15 lakhs of Rupees a year
in his own jagirs alone, The long interval of peace secured
by his arms to Bengal was employed by him in adorning his
capital Dacca with many fine buildings, and constructing sacais
all over {he country. On the whole, he was a generous
nobleman of the grand old style, Shaista Khan was sent back
to Bengal in January 1680. His second term covered the
nine years from 1680 to 1688; the most noticeable event of
this period was the war with the English BE. 1 Co. already
described, The poptiar tradition is that during his governor-
ship rice sold in Bengal al the incredibly cheap rate of eight
inaunds to the Rupee,

Ibrahim Khan arrived in June 1689, as subahdar. [le was
an old man of mild disposition and sedentary habits and a
great lover of books, Wéithoul strength of purpose or capa~
city for action, he let matters drift, till the administration of
the province entirely broke down, and every one did what
he liked, He personally administered justice, was free from
venality and caprice, and promoted agriculture and commerce.
lis first act affer coming to Bengal was to make terms with
the English and induce them to settle in Bengal again.

But Bengal in the late 17th century was no place for a
bookworm. The lawless elements in the province seized the


--- Page 427 ---
490 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIK lon XVII

ae

opportunity presented by [brahim Khan’s supine administra-
fon and slothful tunmartial character. Shova Singh, the
gamindar of Chatwa~-Barda in the Medinipur clistrict, rebelled,
and in alliance with Rahim Khan, the chief of the Orissa
Afghans, began to plunder the lands ot his neighbour, Rajah
Krishna Ram, the farmer-general of the revenuc of the
Bardwan district. Krishna Ram advanced against them with
a small force, but was defeated and slain, and his wife,
daughters and enlire properly and the town of Bardwan itself
were captured by the rebels. Nurullah Khan, the faujdar of
west Bengal, timidly shut himself up in the fort of Hughli,
where the rebels soon blockaded him. He slipped out of il
at night with his bare life, but all his wealth and the fort
fell inlo Shova Singh’s hands.

On the outbreak of the rebellion, the three European
nations in Bengal had enlisted Indian soldiers to guard their
property and obtained the subahdat's permission to ereet
forts round their setilements of Calcutta, Chandernagar and
Chinsura. These places at once became the only havens of
refuge amidst the general disturbance in Bengal. The Dufeh
of Chinsura recovered Hughli forl for the imperial Govern-
ment in August,

Shova Singh's next step was to detach Rahim Khan with
the main part of his army to take the rich cities of Nactia
and Murshidabad, while he returned to his headquarters al
Bardwan. Here he was stabbed to death by a daughter of
Rajah Krishna Ram. The rebel army chose Rahim as their
chief, and he now crowned himsell with the title of Rahim
Shah. By ihis time all Bengal west of the Ganges had passed
into the hands of these men, while Ibrahim Khan lay inactive
al Dacca. Rahim’s army had now increased to 10,000 horse
and 60,000 infantry. [le plundered the tich cities of
Murshidabad, Malda and Rajmahal.

Immediately on hearing details of this rising and [brahim

Khan's negligence, the Emperor dismissed him from the
viccroyalty of Bengal and appointed his grandson, Azim-ush-
shan to the post (middie of 1697). The prince was then in
the Deccan, and pending his arrival Zabarcdast Khan (the son
of Ibrahim and faujdar of Bardwan) recovered Rajmahal and
Malda. [le next attacked the rebel camp at Bhagawangola
and after a two days’ fight captured it (May 1697). Rahim
was successively driven out of Murshidabad and Bardwan
into dhe woods.

In November the prince arrived al Bardwan, and halted
there for many monihs. Zabardast having left the province,
the rebels now reappeared and renewed their activity on
all sides. Rahim, after plundering the Nadia and Hughli
districts, arrived near Bardwan to confront the imperial army.
Here he treacherously slew Khwajah Anwar, the prince's
chief minister, at an interview, and then delivered an
impeluous atlack on the imperial army, but was killed. Their
leader being gone, the rebel army melted away.

Muhammad [adi, surnamed Kar Talb Khan, was transferred
trom the diwant of Orissa in 1701 to be diwan of Bengal,
with dhe ttle of Murshid Ouli Khan. “The prudent manage-
ment of the new diwan soon raised Bengal to the highest
degree of prosperity. Particularly careful in the choice of
his officers, he obtained through their means complete informa-
tion about the actual capacity of the lands and the amount
of custom duties, The diwan took the collection into his own
hands, and by preventing the embezzlemenis of the zamindars
and jagirdars, augmented the annual revenue.”

Murshid Quli refused fo let Azim-ush-shan interfere with
reventie matters in any way. The foolish prince instigated a
plot of some troopers to mutiny and murder the diwan. The
conspiracy was defeated by Murshid Qui Khan's presence of
mind, courage and fact But, to guard against further attempts
ott his fife, he removed the revenue office from Dacca, where

the prince lived as governor, toa more centrally situated village
on the bank of the Ganges, whose name of Magqstudabad he
changed to Murshid-abad in honour of himself. This was destined
fo be the capital of Bengal for half the 18th century. Aurangzib,
on hearing of the incident, grew very angry, anc ordered
the prince to remove to Bihar, which had been added to
his charge in January 1703. For the next three years (1704.
1707) Azim lived at Patna, which he was permitted by the
Emperor to name Azim-abad after his own name,

Murshid Quli Khan repeatedly sent to the Emperor large
sums as the surplus revenue of the province. The money
came most opporiunely to Aurangzib, whose other resources
had been exhausted by lhe endless war with the Marathas,
Under Murshid Quli all felt that a strong master had come
to the province. He collected the revenue by his own agents
directly and thus saved the profits which middlemen or zamin~
dars used fo make. The orders of Murshid Quli Khan were
so absolute that the most refractory men trembled in his
presence, and his commands were implicitly obeyed. Two
days in the week he administered justice in person, and was
sO impartial in his decisions and rigid in their execution that
no one dared to commit oppression.

A few years after the death of Aurangzib he became
independent ruler of Bengal, as the Dethi Government sank into
hopeless decline. Under him Bengal entered on a career ol
peace and marvellous material prosperity, which was interrupted
only by the follies and crimes of his unworthy successors,

§ 3. Malwa, its importance in Mughal times,

The Mughal province of Malwa extended north to south
between the Jamuna and the Narmada rivers. West of it,
across the Chambal, lies Rajputana, and east of if Bundelkhand,
from which the river Betwa separates if. The most notable
element of its population are the Rajputs, divided into an


--- Page 430 ---
MALWA, TIS DIVERSIITD POPULATION 495

immense number of petty clans or minor branches of famous
clans, and not organized in compact tribal States as in Rajputana
proper. But their number and importance were not so prepon-
derant as to throw info insignificance other races of inhabitants,
such as the Jails who were spread over the northern side,
and the Gonds concentrated jn full strength in the soulh and
ihe south-easi,~-besides a strong infusion of Muhammadan
immigrants (mostly Afghans) settled in definite centres, The
undeveloped primitive races, though strong in number, lived
in out of the way corners and among the hills and jungles.

Malwa was rich in agricultural wealth,—producing large
quantities of the higher crops, such as opium, sugarcane,
grapes, muskemelons and betel-leaf, besides sheltering large
herds of elephants in its forest tracts. In industries it occupied
the first rank among the Mughal subahs after Gujrat. In
Mughal times its importance was enhanced by the fact that
all the great military roads from the northern capitals, Agra
and Delhi, io the Deccan passed through this province.

A preponderantly Hindu province, with a sturdy Rajput
population, was not likely io take Aurangzib’s policy of temple
destruction and poll-tax on the Hindus with tame submissiveness.
They often fought the agents of Islam in defence of the seats
of their religion. But, on the whole, the disturbances in Malwa
during the first half of this reign were all on a small scale
and confined to a few localities, With the exception of the
raids of Chhatra Sal Bundela and Bakht Buland Gond, Malwa
continued to enjoy peace arid uneventful administration — tilt
near the end of the 17th century. But after Rajaram’s return
home from Jinji began a movement which was destined in less

the province.

§ 4, Maratha incursions into Malwa, 1699-1706.

In November 1699, a Maratha band led by Krishna Savant

crossed the Narmada for the first time and raided Malwa up

to the environs of Dhamuni. The path thus opened was
never again closed, till at last in the middle of the 18th century
Malwa passed into regular Maratha possession. {n January
17035, the Marathas crossed the Narmada again, and caused
disturbances up to the environs of Ujjain. In October 1703, Nima
Sindhia burst into Berar, defeated and captured Ruslam Khan
the deputy governor of the province (on behalf of Firuz Jang),
and then raiding the Hushangabad districl and crossing the
Narmada he advanced into Malwa at the invilation of Chhalra
Sal. Affer plundering many villages and towns, he laid siege
to Sironj, but Firuz Jang, who had entered Berar in pursuit of
another Maratha force, hastened with light equipment on the
track of the raiders, overlook them near Sironj, and immediately
delivered his attack, (middie of November). Nima fled away
on horseback. Many of the Marathas and their local Rajput
and Afghan allies were slain or wounded. The followers and
eattle of Rustam, whom Nima was dragging along with himself,
were released.

In February 1704 Firuz Jang, following up his success,
surptised Nima’s army, which was off its guard, near the jungle
of Dhamuni, slaying many and recovering much booty, There
were heavy losses on the Mughal side too.

It was a great deliverance for the Mughals. The Maratha
activities in Berar had held up the reports of news-wrilers and
official letters for 3 or 4 months on the bank of the Narmada.
The danger from which Malwa had just escaped, through Ficuz
Jang’s courage and activity, brought home to Aurangzib’s mind
the gravity of the situation. Prince Bidar Bakht, a brave and
skilful general, then acting as governor of Aurangabad and
Khandesh, was appointed viceroy of Malwa on 3rd August,
1704, He continued fo govern Malwa till March 1706, when
he received urgent orders to go to Gujral and take charge
of its defence,

The prince's favourite lieutenant was the young gallant fai

Singh (Sawai), the new Rajah of Jaipur, who had gained his
goad opinion by his conspicuous services.

Among the vebels who troubled Malwa were Nasiri
Afghan, Gopal Singh Chandawat, Gopal Chaudhuri of Sironi,
Abbas Afghan, and Umar Pathan. In fact, the local disturbers of
peace in Malwa in the closing years of the reign were too
many to be counled. “Marathas, Bundelas, and Afghans out
of employment are creating disturbances in the province” (1704).
The result is summed up in Aurangzib’s own words: “The
province of Khandesh has been totally desolated....Malwa too
is ruined,—very little babitation is now left.”

8 5. Cifiatra Sal Bundela’s early life.

Champat Rao Bundela’s fourth son, Chhatra Sal (born in
1650), lived io defy the imperial Government with success for
half a century, keep his own province in constant turmoil,
invade Malwa, and finally to carve ont an independent
principality in Eastern Malwa, with fts capital at Panna. His
long life of 8t years ended in 1731.

Left helpless by their father’s oullawry and death, Chhatra
Sal and his elder brother Angad were first employed by Jai
Singh in his own contingent, in the war against Shivaji (1665),
and afterwards rewarded for their gallant services by being
created imperial mansabdars (Gazari and 3-sadi respectively)
in August following.

Chhatra Sal was next employed in the Mughal attack on
Deogarh by Dilir Khan. But the young Bundela prince felt
that he was nol being rewarded as he deserved, and that a
suballern’s career in the Mughal army did not offer full scope
to his soating ambition. He dreamt of taking fo a fife of
adyerture and independence in fmitation of Shivaji, whom he
visitecl,

But the Maratha king advised, him to return to his own
country and use his local influence io promote tisings against


--- Page 433 ---
498 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB lon, XVIII

Aurangzib, so as to distract the Mughal forces. Chhatra Sal,
on his return home, began to attack the mighty Mughal
empire.

The policy of temple destruction on which Aurangzib
launched in 1670, created an opening which Chhatra Sal at
once seized. The Tlindu. population of Bundelkhand and
the adjoining province of Malwa took up arms in defence of
the altars of their gods. They sighed for a bold leader who
would repeat Champat’s spirited defiance of the Mughal
Emperor and protect their religion. Chhatra Sal was, therefore,
hailed as the champion of the Hindu faith and Kshatriya
honour. Even Sujan Singh, the loyal Bundela Rajah of Urchha,
sent him a secrel message of praise and good wishes,

8 6. Cihaira Sal’s war with Mughal Government.

“The news of Chhalra Sal's advance (1671) was grateful to
Bundela ears.” The rebels elected Chhatra Sal as their leader
and the king of all the Bundelas, his army numbering 335
men. But he soon received large reinforcements, The hope of
plunder drew to his side vast numbers of reeruits from this
martial tribe, especially, Champat’s old followers in brigandage.
In the earlier part of his career, Chhatra Sal’s raiding activities
were mostly directed against the Dhamuni district and
the rich city of Sironf which lay 65 miles west of it He
looted the villages of these two vegions year after year.
Successive Mughal faujdars of Dhamuni tesisted hin with
indifferent results.

In a short time Chhatra Sal’s repeated successes decided
the waverers. Many other petty chiefs joined him, and even
Durjan Sal, the Hada usurper of Bundi, allied himself with
the rebels of Bundelkhand. Chhatra Sal followed the Maratha
system of sparing the places thal paid him a blackmail of
one-fourth of their standard revenue (efautf), As Auranyzib
became more and more deeply entangled in the Deccan,


--- Page 434 ---
LATER LIFE OF CHIIATRASAL BUNDCLA 499

Chhatra Sal achieved more brilliant — teiumphs, including the
capture of Kalinjar and Dhamuni and the toot of Bhilsa,
The range of his raids was greatly extended ; the whole of
Malwa from the ‘Jamuna to the Rajput border and the
Narmada was his happy hunting ground, and he became a
nucleus round which alf lawless men of this region assembled.

In March 1699, Sher Afkan Khan, the faujdar of Banod
(70 m. n. of Sironj), marched against him, and attacked him
near Suraj-Mau. After a severe battle, Chhatra Sal fled into
the fort, which the Khan besieged, but the Bundela chief
escaped from it) Bul Chhatra Sat had his revenge next year.
On 84th April 1700 Sher Afkan Khan attacked him near Jhuna
anc Barna, slew about 700 of his men, and dispersed the
rest after wounding Chhatra Sal himself. But the Khan was
mortally wounded by a musket-shot.

In 1705 Firuz Jang induced the Emperor to make terms
with the irrepressible Bundela. Chhatra Sal was created a
4.fhagari in the Mughal peerage and induced to visit the
Emperor in the Decean. Here he lived in peace for a year
and a half, and then, on Aurangzib’s death, returned home
to renew his career of independence.”

87. The Gond kingdoms and their relations with the
Dfagfials.

Gondwana covers much of ihe modern Central Provinces,
and stretches on bolh sides of the Vindhya range. In the
northern half of this region a great kingdom had been
established in the {6th century by the Gond Rajah of Garha.
But Akbar’s generals distnembered the kingdom and sacked
its capitals Garha and Chauragarh. The later Rajahs reigned
at Chauragarh, with diminished power and territory, and
rapidly sank into obscurity in the middle of the 17th century.

430 SHORE WSTORY OF AURANGZIB [cu. XVI

The predominance among the Gonds now passed to the
chiefs of Deogarh, in the centre of Gondwana and south of the
Narmada river. Some twenty-five miles south of Deogarh lay
Chanda, the seal of another Gond Rajah, who was the constant
enemy and rival of the house of Deogarh. These were the only
Gond States that counted for anything in the reign of Aurangzib,
and their accumulated treasure, herds of elephants, and
collections of gems locally quarried, made them objects of
cupidity fo the Mughal Government In 1637 a Mughal army,
released from operations in the Deccan, entered Gondwana,
levying contribulions from the local chiefs, Tt stormed Nagpur,
the seat of the Deogarh Rajah Kukia. The fort was restored
to him on his promising an annual tribute.

But the tribule fell fato arrears, and in 1655 a Mughal army
matched into Deogarh territory and forced the Rajah (Kesari
Singh) to make an abject submission. The arrears grew to
15 Jakhs at the end of 1666.

An imperial army under Dilir Khan marched into Gondwana
in January 1667. Manji Malar, the Rajah of Chanda, had been
refractory and done some acls of lawlessness. But on the
arrival of the Mughal army al Mandura on his frontier (Peb,
16647), he offered submission, and promised a war contribution
of one krore of Rupees and an annual tribute of two lakhs.
Dilir Khan slayed there for two months, during which he
realized 77 lakhs of Rupees out of the promised contribution.

Kuk Singh, the Rajah of Deogarh, was frightened by the
fate of the Chanda chieflain, He humbly wailed on Dilir Khan,
agreeing to pay three lakhs as fine, and deliver 18 lakhs
within a fixed period. He, however, did not keep his promise,
and in August 1669 Dilir Khan bad to repeat his invasion.
The Mughals overran Deogarh. The Rajah with his entire
family (two brothers and one sister) embraced Islam, . as the
price of restoration to his kingdom, and on 29th March Dilir
Khan left Nagpur for the south.

GOND RAJAHS OF CHANDA AND DEOGARH 431

Bul the alfituce of the Gond Rajah was not changed with
his change of religion under temptation. He continued
refractory, In March 1686, one claimant to this State was
converted fo Islam with the title of Rajah Bakht Buland and
given the throne, Ile lived to. extend the area, power and
prosperity of his kingclom very largely, aucl to give the greatest
trouble to Aurangzib in the fast years of his reign,

Ram Singh, the Rajah of Chanda, was deposed in
Oclober 1683 and the threne given to Kishan Singh. But
the old Rajah refused to yield possession to his rival.
So, a Mughal force under  Itiqad Khan entered his
capifal on 2nd Nov, 1684 and installed Kishan Singh. This
Rajah was succeeded by his eldesi son, Bir Singh, in July
1696. In August 1700 he was summoned to the Emperor's
camp as his tribute had fallen into arrears. He reached the
Emperors army on 287 April {7O! anc paid one lakh into
ihe Berar treasury.

$ 8. Boak&t Butand, Gond Rajah of Deogarh, asserts Bis
independence.

In June 1691, Bakht Buland was deposed by the Emperor,
and the throne of Dengarh was given fo another Muslim
Gond named Dindar. Bakht Buland, after being kept under
surveillance for some years, recovered his freedom (Aug, 1695)
by giving security Sor his future conduet, though the Emperor
remarked, “lle will run away; keep a watch on him.” Soon
after this, trouble began again in Deogarh. Dindar proved
defiant, and a Mughal force with the help of the Chanda
Rajah Kishan Singh, captured Deogarh and drove Dindar into
flight (Match 1696), Kan Singh, the second son of Kishan
Singh, secured the throne of Deogarh by turning Muslim
(under the name of Rajah Neknam). Bakht Buland now lost
all hope of his restoration, The time was opportune for a
bold stroke, fo fest fortune by a throw of the dice, as


--- Page 437 ---
439 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIS (cu. XVUL

Deogarh and Chanda had both changed their rulers in the
same year (1696), and their new Rajahs were mere lads. He,
therefore, slipped away from the imperial army, returned to
Deogarh, and raised the standard of rebellion with remarkable
pertinacity, resourcefulness and success. The Emperor, in
impotent anger, ordered his name to be changed from Baht
Buland (‘Fortunate’) to Nagun Bok&t (‘Luckless'). The  rebel’s
activity spread over a wide area. Berar was his nearest
hunting ground. A detachment from Firuz Jang’s army
defeated Batht Buland and captured Deogarh (June, 1699).
The rebel escaped from his doomed capital and entered Malwa
with a vast force; he next occupied the kingdom of Garha
and restored Narendra Shah to his ancestral throne, (July).

Baht Buland in July sent Rs. 30,000 lo Chhatra Sal with
a request to recruit a body of the famous Bundela musketeers
for him. In October, he sent two envoys to Rajaram in
Satara fort, to invile hita to Deogarh, in order to create a
diversion in Aurangzib’s rear; but the Maratha king clectined
under the advice of his generals. Early in March 1701, Baleht
Buland and his uncle Nawal Shah, the zamindar of Jamgarh,
in concert wilh the Marathas assembled a force of 4,000
troopers and 19,000 infantry, and altacked Ali Mardan Khan,
the governor of Berar, bul they were defeated with great
slaughter, Nawal Shah being killed and Bakht Buland wounded.
Risings by Bakht Buland’s Muslim allies ate reported ia
February 1703 (near Ujjain under Abbas) and January 170-4
(under Sayyid Abdul Qadir).

“During Bakht Buland’s rcign the rich lands to the south
of Deogarh, between the Wainganga and Kanhan rivers, were
steadily developed. Hindu and Muhammadan cultivators
were encouraged to setile in them on equal terms with Gonds,
until this region became most prosperous.” Industrious settlers
from all quarters were atlracted to Gondwana, many towns
and villages were founded, and agriculture, manufactures, and

even commerce made considerable advances. On the death
of Aurangzib, this Deogarh chief extended his kingdom; the
Seont district was ceded to him by Narendra Shah and he
also annexed the ancient historical Gond principality of Khetla.
But the glory of Deogarh departed on the death of | his
successor Chand Sultan (1739), and the Maratha house of
Nagpur secured his kingdom.

89. Condftion of Kashmir under the Mughals,

The Mughal Emperors treated Kashmir merely as a pleasure
resort They did not try to improve the face of the land
or the condition of the people.

The common people of Kashmir were sunk in the deepest
ignorance and poverty; many of the villagers lived jn
primitive simplicity and went about almost naked for want
of clothing; they merely wrapped a blanket round their
bodies for wartnth. Long distances and lack of roads mace
it impossible fo import grain from outside, and every valley
had to be self-contained in the matter of fits food supply ; and
when a natural calamity like flood or heavy snowfall cut off
communications, the inhabitants perished helplessly of famine
in thousands, The province was off the routes of the civilized
world : difficully of transport raisecl the cost of marketing its
produce. The province had no local industry. Even shawl-weaving
was mostly a Goverment monopoly, and the people earned
from it only the wages of daily labour at the State factories,
The fine Kashmiri paper was consumed only by the Court,
and made to order,

So backward were the people in civilization that even the
upper classes of Kashmiris were deemed unfit to be employed
in the imperial service as mansabdars, till near the end of
Aurangzib’s reign, We learn that it was only in 1699 that
the Ermperor was first induced by the then sabafidar to
appoint people of Kashmir as mansabdars. No Kashmiri Hindu

OR ‘

AdA SHORI INSIORY OF AURANGZIB (cu. XVII

gained any office under the Mughal empire, and as for the
common Muslims of the province, if they were villagers they
were despised as ignorant savages, and if townsmen as_ lying
flatterers and cowardly cheats, so that in Mughal India a
Kashmiri came to be a by-word for a smooth-spoken rogue.
Ignorance, poverty, and the feudal organization of society,—
which kept the masses in a servile condition, also
accounted for their sale of the honour of their wives
and daughters.

The ignorance of the people was only equalled by their
superstitiousness. A huge parasite class of Muslim saints and
their disciples flourished in this charming climate and exploited
ihe eredulity of the people, In the cities of Kashmir, the
sectarian bitterness between the Shias aud the Sunnis often fed
to fierce rioting and even civil war, and the strong arm of
the governor (when he did not happen fo be the partisan
of either sect) could only maintain an armed truce among the
local population, Quarrels between individual members of the
rival sects quickly passect into mass conflicts; the Sunni mob
of the capital, roused by the qagi’s harangues, plundered and
burnt the Shia quarter, and massacred every Shia whom they
could catch. Sometimes there were pilched batlles in the
streets between the atmed rioters and the governar’s troops.
Even the viceroy’s residence was not safe from the Sunni
mob and soldiery, if he was suspected of harbouring’ any
Shia whom they wanted fo lynch,

The villagers were half-naked boors, living in abject poverty,
ignorance, and filth. The townsinen, too, had nol ai mueh
happier lot. The sudden and dangerous floods to which the
lake is subjeci, forced them to build their homes in the cramped
high ground above the edge of the river or the lake The
frequency of earthquakes made it necessary for their houses
to be light wooden structures, The intense cold of the counlry
made fires necessary in every household day and night The


--- Page 440 ---
CALAMITIES AND RIOTS IN KASHMIR 435

natural consequence of this chain of causes was that conflagra-
lions were frequent, and when they broke out they spread
from one end of the city to another, making a clean sweep
of these crowded human warrens of timber and grass,

8 10. Auvangzib’s viceroys and thete doings in Kasfhmit.

In Aurangzib’s reign, there were twelve subahdars in
Kashmir during 48 years. The life of the province varied as
the characters of ils successive governors varied. Some of
them, like Itimad Khan and Fazil Khan, administered justice
with great diligence and honoured learning. Others, like Saif
Khan, introduced innovations in the form of (illegal exactions
to entich themselves.

The long roll of natural calamities during the half century
of Aurangzib’s reign includes two earthquakes June 1669 and
1681), two conflagralions of the capital (1673 and 1678), one
flood (1681), and a famine (1688). The most notable events
of this perod in the history of Kashmir were Aurangzib's royal
prosress through it (1663), of which Bernier has left a
graphic account (with a wrong date) and the conquest of
Greater Tibet (1666) whose ruler, styled Daldal Namjal in the
Persian chronicles, bowed to Islam.

In 1684 took place what was probably the worst fight
between the Shias and the Sunnis. The Hasanabad quarter of
Srinagar was a Shia stronghold. A resident of it named Abdus
Shakur and his sons had done some injury to a Sunni named
Sadiq. Their enmity grew into a long-standing quarrel. In the
course of it these Shias publicly did some acts and made some
remarks designed to insult the memory of the first three Khalifs
(who were usurpers, according lo Shia theology). The offenders
took refuge with the governor Ibrahim Khan, The qaai
Muhammad Yusuf, in pious frenzy, roused the mob of the
city and they set fire to the Hasanabad quarter. During the
riot, the governor’s son Fidai Khan came out to support the


--- Page 441 ---
436 SUORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB fen. XVIU

men of Hasanabad, while the mob, stregthened by the Kabul
officers just returned from Tibet and some local mansabdars,
opposed him. Many were slain and wounded on both sides
and the mob rioted with terrible fury.

Ibrahim Khan, fincing himself worsted in the contest, at
last handed Abdus Shakur and other accused Shias over to the
qazi, by whom Shakur and his two sons and one son-inelaw were
put to death under canonical sentence. The Sunni rioters were
masters of the city and sacked the wmufti’s house, though he
was a Sunni. Baba Qasim, the preceplor of the Shias, was
seized on the road and put to death with disgrace. Fidai
Khan rode out and slew a local leader of the Sunnis with
many of the mob, But in the meantime, Shaikh Baqa Baba
had assembled another crowd, and set fire to [brahim Khan's
mansion! That governor then arrested and imprisoned Baga
Baba, the qazi, news-wrifter, and bakhshi of the province, and
the leading men of the capital. This strong action cowed the
people into submission. Aurangzib, on hearing of these
occurrences, removed [brahim Khan from the viceroyally and
ordered the Sunni captives to be released.

About 1698-99 an event happened which roused the
religious fervour of the Muslims to the point of overflowing.
This was the bringing into the country of the repuled hair of
the Prophet Muhammad which Khwajah Nuruddin had secured
in Bijaput, and which was sent after the Khwajah’s death to
Kashmir along with his corpse. The entire Muslin population
poured out inlo the streets and open spaces, fo behold and to
touch the blessed relic.

Another incident, illustrating the gross credulity of the
people of Kashmir, took place in May 1699, which in that
year was the Muslim month of fasting (Ramzan). A stranger
of some position named Mir Husain had come to Kashmir and
taken up his residence near the Takhti-Sulaiman hill, where he
set up his hermitage. In the month of Ramzan he prepared


--- Page 442 ---
WEALTIT AND TRADE OF GUJRAT 437

a giand illumination in honour of the season. Most of the
people of Srinagar went there for excutsion and sight-seeing.
In the third quarter of the day such a violent storm of wind
rain thunder and fightning burst upon the place that the
whole city was darkened as in the darkest night, Tt continued
sO for some time, and then the people, believing that the Sun
had sel, broke their day’s fast. But after 2 or3 hours the
tempest ceased, the Sun reappeared, and all felt themselves
befooled and disgraced, for a Muslim can hardly commit a
greater sin than to eat anything in the day-time of the
month of Ramzan. It is characteristic of the intelligence
and education of the people of the capital city of Kashmir
that all of them, high and low alike, ascribed this abnormal
phenomenon to the magic art of that heretic hermit. The
“faith-defending, truth-knowing” Emperor believed in the charge
and ordered the magician to be expelled,

8 14. Gujrat, its advaniageous position and divetsified
population.

The wealth of Gujrat was mainly due to its handicrafts
and commerce. The former could flourish only in walled cities
and in the villages nestling in their shelter. In commerce,
not only did its people, both Hindus and Muhammadans,
possess a nalural capacity surpassing that of other natives
of India, but Gujrat enjoyed a position of exceptional
advantage, All the merchandise of the rich inland districts of
Khandesh, Berar, Malwa and even Upper India bad to cross
Gujrat for shipment abroad. On the coast of this province
stand the greatest ports of India;—Broach in Hindu times and
Surat in Muslim. Gujral was, therefore, pre-eminenlly the gate
of India in Mughal times, in respect of the outer Muslim world.
Through Surat passed the enormots volume of Muslim
pilgrims to the holy  cilies of Arabia and of Shia votaries to
the shrines of Najaf and Karbala. Travellers, merchants,

scholars, fortune hunters, and political refugees from Persia,

Arabia, Turkey, Egypl, Zanzibar and even Khurasan and
Barbary used fo enter India through the Gujrat ports
by the short, comfortable, cheap and usually safe “ocean
highway, while the land route across the Sulaiman anel
Hindu Kush ranges fell into growing neglect.

This geographical advanlage has given Gujrat a very
composite population and a large foreign strain ftom very
carly times, especially the fire-worshipping Persians and that
branch of the Ismailia heretics of Islam who are popularly
known as Bohras as well as the tnotthodox sect of Mahclavis.
These and other emigrant clans or families along wilh the
remnants of the Muslim tribes that had held sway over the land
before the coming of the Mughals, have given an unmarallelled
diversity to the racial complexion of the province. On the
[lindu side the population is even less homogeneous ; there were
in the fringe areas of Gujral in the 17th century many primitive
races not yet broken to civilization and orderly political
life, such as the Kolis (in the south), the Bhils in Baglana
(south-east), the wild Rajpuis and pseudo-Rajputs in the
castern frontier, and the predalory Grasias scattered through
out the province, besides the Kathis of the west, These were
an ever present menace to the peace of the country. To
them were added in Aurangzib’s reign another race of

disturbers, the Marathas, who at last swept Mughal rule out
of the province,

§ 19. Governors of Gajeat under Auranyzib.

During Aurangzib’s reign of 50 years Gujrat was governed
for him by twelve viceroys, of whom Mahabat Khan (6 years,
1662—1668), Md. Amin Khan (10 years, 1672-1682), Shujaet
Khan (17 years, 1684-1701), and Prince Md. Azam (4 years,
1701-1704) ruled the province longest. In the remaining 13
years there were as many as eight subahdars.


--- Page 444 ---
1706} MARATHAS INVADE GUIRAT 439

Gujrat had an evil reputation for famines in the middle
ages, and the reign of Aurangzib was no happier in this
respecl. We read of famines in 1681, 1684, 1690-91, 1605.96
and 1698. In 168 there were bread-riots in the capital.
The droughl of 1696 was so terrible that “from Patan
to Jodhpur ho water not blade of grass could be seen.”
In addition to these natural calamities, pestilence desolated
many of the cilies, lingering for years together in them.
Among the noteworthy public disturbances was the overflow
of the Rajput war across the north-eastern frontier of Gujrat
(1680) when Bhim Singh the son of Maharana Raj Singh
raided Vacdnagar, Vishalnagar and some other tich cities.

8 13. Maratha invasion of Gujrat, 1706.

The greatest disasler that the Marathas inflicted on the
Emperor’s troops occurred early in 1706, during the interval
belween the departure of Prince Azam from Ahmadabad
(25 Now. 1705) and the arrival of Bidar Bakht there (30 July
1706). The Marathas under Dhana Jadav took prompt advantage
of Ihis defenceless condition of the province for the time being.
At Ratanpue Cin Rajpipla), the two divisions of the imperial
lroops were signally defeated one after the other by Dhana.
Two of their chiefs, Safdar Khan Babi and Nazar Ali Khan,
were captured and held to ransom; their camps were looted,
and large nutnbers of Mtsalmans perished or were taken
captive, ({5 March, 1706).

When Abdul Hamid Khan (the deputy governor) himself
atrived with another army, his small force was surrounded
by the exullant victors near the Baba Piara ford, all the chiefs
including the deputy governor himself were taken prisoner,
and their entire camp and baggage plundered. Then the
Marathas levied chautf on the stutrounding country and
retired after plundering the towns and villages that failed
to pay it The Kolis had taken advantage of these disorders

fo rise and sack the rich trading centre of Baroda for
iwo days.

8 14. Religious persecution of the Bohra and Kfoja sects.

A. spiritual guide of the Ismailia sect named Qutb had
been putto death by order of Aurangzib carly in his reign,
In 1705 the Emperor, learning that Khanji, the head of the
Ismailia sect and successor to Qutb, hac sent twelve emissaries
(dais) who were secretly perverting Muslims to this heresy,
ordered the twelve men and certain other members of | this
community to be arrested and sent to him under careful guard,
with the money collected by them and the sixty and odd holy
books of their faith. This was done, At the same time orthodox
leachers were appointed by the State to educate the children
and illiterate people of the Bohras in every village and city
in Sunni doctrines and practices. Their mosques had been
converted to Sunni usage earlice in the reign.

Another branch of — these seclaries, called Kfofas in
Kathiawad and Mumins (or Matias) in Gujral, consisted
mastly of Ilindus converted to Islam by a saint named Sayyic
Imam-ud-din, whose tomb al Karmalah © miles outside
Ahmadabad) was their chief shrine. They paid idolatrous
adoration to their spiritual guide, kissing bis toes and heaping
up gold and silver on his feet, while he sat in royal splendour
behind a screen and they supported him by a regular voluntary
fax of one-tenth of their annual income, Aurangeil ordered
the atrest of their spiritual heacl, Sayyicl Shahji, The man killed
himself by poison on the way, but his son, a boy of lwelve,
was sent to Aurangzib, Al this all his followers in Gujrat rose
fo wreak vengeance on the governor, saying thal he had
murdered their religious head. They fought and killed the
faujdar of Broach, captured that cily, and held it in a body
4,000 strong (Oct, 1685). The subahdar after a long siege
recovered the fort and butchered the fanatics within it

CHAPTER XIX

AURANGZIB'S CHARACTER AND THE EFFECT
OF HIS REIGN.

§ 1. Peace the root-cause of India’s prospetity.

To all ouler observers the Mughal empire seemed fo have
atlained to its highest splendour and power when Aurangzib
ascended the throne of Delhi “The wealth of Ind” had
become proverbial in far off countries, and the magnificence
of the Court of the Great Mughal had “dazzled even eyes
which were accustomed {to the pomp of Versailles.” And
when a trained administrator and experienced general like him,
who was also a puritan in the simplicity and putity of his
private fife, succeeded fo the guidance of this rich heritage
in lhe fulness of his physical and mental powers, all people
hoped that he would carry the empire to unimaginable heights
of glory. And yet the result of Aurangzib’s long and
strenuous reign was utter cissolution and misery. The causes
of this strange phenomenon it is the duty of the historian to
investigate.

In a warm, moist and fertile country! like India—where the
lavish bounty of Nature speedily repairs the ravages of hostile
man and beast, of inclement stn and rain,~—order is the root
of national life, in an even greater degree than in other lands.
Given peace without! and the spirit of progress: within, the
Indian people can advance in wealth, strength and civilization
with a rapidity rivalled only by the marvellous growth of
their vegetation after the first monsoon showers, A century of
strong and wise government under Akbar and his son and
grandson had given to the richer and more populous half of


--- Page 447 ---
449 SHORT IISTORY OF AURANGZIS fon. XIX

India such peace and impulse to improvement. A hundred
victories since the second Panipat had taught the Indian world
to believe that Mughal arms were invincible and Mughal territory
inviolable. Shivaji broke this spell. Mughal peace—-the sole
justification of the Mughal empire~-no longer existecl in India at
Aurangzib’s death,

In a predominantly agricultural country like India, the tillers
of the soil are the only source of national wealth. Directly
or indirectly, the land alone adds to the “annual nalional stock.”
Even the ecraffsmen depend on the peasants and on the men
enriched with the land revenue, for the sale of their goods,
and if the Jatter have not enough foodstuff to spare, they
cannot buy any handicraft. Hence, ihe ruin of the peasants ,
means it India the ruin of the non-agricullural classes foo. Pane
paysans pauvre royaune, is even truer of India than of
Prance. Public peace aml security of properly are necessary
not only for the peasant and the artisan, bul also for the
trader, who has to carry his goods over wide dislances and
give long credits before he can find a profitable market.
Wealth, in the last resorl, can accumulate only from savings
out of ihe peasant’s production. Whatever lowers the
peasant’s productive power or destroys his spiril of  thrifl by
eveating insecurity aboul his property, thereby prevents the
growth of national capital and impairs the economic — staying
power of the country. Such are the universal and fasling
effects of disorder and public insecurity in Incia, And the

reign of Aurangzib affords the most striking illustration of
this truth,

§ 2 Feconomic drain of Aurangsib's ceaseless warfare.

The economic drain caused by Aurangzib’s quarler century
of watlate in the Deccan was appalling in its character and
most far-reaching and durable in its effects, The operations
of the imperial armies, especially their numerous sieges, led


--- Page 448 ---
1707] DEPOPULATION AND RUIN OF AGRICULTURE AAS
to a lolal destruction of forests and grass. The huge Mughal
forces, totalling 1,70,000 troops according to the official records:
with perhaps ten times that number of non-combatants, soon
alc up everything green wherever they moved. In addition,
the Maratha raiders destroyed whatever they could not carry “
off, feeding their horses on the standing crops, and burning
the houses and property too heavy to be removed, Hence,
it is no workler that when at last in 1703 Attrangzib retired
afler his last campaign, the country presented a scene of utter
desolation. “He left behind him the fields of these provinces
devoid of trees and bare of crops, their places being taken
by the bones of men and beasts.” (Manucci). ‘This total and
extensive deforestation had a most injurious effect on agriculture.
The financial exhaustion of the empire in these endless wars
left Government and private owners alike too poor to repair
the buildings and roads worn out by the lapse of time

The labouring population suffered not only from violent
capture, forced labour, and starvation, but also from epidemics
which were very frequent during these campaigns, [yen in the
imperial camp, where grealer comforl, security and civilization
might have been expected, the annual wastage of the Deccan
wars was one lakh of men, and three lakhs of horses, oxen,
camels and clephants. At the siege of Golkonda (1687) a
famine broke out, “In Tlaidarabad city the houses, river
and plain were filled with ithe dead. The same was
the condition of the imperial camp..Kos after kos
the eye fell only on mounds of corpses. The incessant
rain melled away the flesh and skin... After some months
when the rains ceased, the white ridges of bones looked from
a distance like hills of snow.’ The same desolation overtook
tracts which had hilherto enjoyed peace and prosperity. The
acule observer Bhimsen writes about the Eastern Karnatak, « ¥
“During the rule of the Bijapur Golkonda and Telinga [dynas+
ties} this country was extensively cultivated. But now many

s

places have been turned into wilderness on account of the
passage of the imperial armies, which has inflicted hardship
and oppression on the people.” And he noticed the same
thing in Berar also.

In 1688, Bijapur was visiled by a desolaling epidemic of
bubonic plague, which is estimated to have carried off a
bundred thousand lives in three months, So, foo, we read of
a plague in Prince Azam’s camp in Aug. 1694, The English
factors at Surat report similar devastaling epidemics throughout
Western India in 1694 and 1696 Gwhen 95,000 men perished),
|To take one example only, the drought and plague of 1702—04
killed two millions of men. In addition to disease, great
natural calamities like flood, drought and excessive and un-
seasonable rainfall were frequent in the Deccan at the begin-
ning of the 18th century, which aggravated the sufferings of
invaders and natives alike and still further recdticed the popu-
lation. The stale of war, spread over nearly a generation of
time, had left no savings, no power of resistance in the com-
mon people ; everything they produced or had stored up
was swept away by the hordes on both sides, so that when
famine or drought came, the peasants and landless labourers
perished helplessly like flies. Scarcity was chronic in the
imperial camp and often deepened into famine. The former
remarkable cheapness of grain now became a forgotten myth
in many parts of India.

8 3, Injury to trade and industry by wat, disorder,
and offietal exactions.

There being in many places no peace or safety for illage,
fhe starving and exasperated peasantry took to highway
robbery as the only means of living. In the Deccan they
gathered arms and horses and used to join the Marathas in
their raids. Raiding bands were, also, locally formed, which

at


--- Page 450 ---
DISORDER AND RCONOMIC RLUIN 4445

gave employment to many and chances of glory and wealth
to the more spirited’ among the villagers. Trade almost ceased
in the Deccan during this unhappy quarter century. Caravans
could teavel south of the Narmada only under strong escort ;
hence, they had to wait in the fortified towns for months
before they could get an opportunity of advancing further
towards their destination in safety. We even read of the royal
mail and baskets of fruits for the Emperor’s table being held
up for five months at the Narmada by Maratha disturbances
in the roads beyond it

Even where war was not raging (as in Bengal), the

weakening of the central Government emboldened provincial *

governors to disregard imperial prohibitions, and to make
money by forcing goods from traders at absurdly low prices
and then selling them in the public marts, and also by
exacting fotbidden abwabs {from craftsmen and merchants.
[See my Mugfal Administration, Ch. 3.) In the absence of
security al home and the impossibility of making purchases at
distances, arts and crafts ceased to be practised except in the
walled cities. Village industries and industrial classes almost
died out The Madras coast, for instance, with its teeming
weaving population, was so unsettled by the Mughal-Maratha
struggle for the Karnatak (1690—1698) that the Englishand the
French factors found it difficult to get enough clothes for loading
their Europe-going ships. Thus ensued a great economic
impoverishment of India-—not only a decrease of the “national
stock”, but also a rapid lowering of mechanical skill and
standard of civilization, a disappearance of art and culture
over wide tracis of the country.

The Mughal soldiers on their march often trod down the
crops, and though the Emperor had a special body of
officers for compensating the peasants for ithis loss (pafmali-
izarait), his financial difficulties led to the neglect of this
humane tule. The worst oppressors of the peasants, however,


--- Page 451 ---
446 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB fen. XIX

were the tail of the army-the vast nondescript horde of
servants, day labourers, darvishes and olher vayrants who
followed Aurangzib’s “moving city of tents” in the hope of
picking up crumbs where such a crowd had gathered together.
Particularly the Beluchi camel-owners who hired out their
animals to the army, and the unattached Afghans searching
for employment, plundered and beat the country people most
mercilessly. The banjaras or wandering grain-dealer tribe,
who moved in bodies, sometimes of 5,000 men, each with
his couple of bullocks loaded with grain, were so strong in
their strength of numbers and contempt for the petty officers
of Government, that they sometimes looted the people on the
wayside and fed their catile on the crops in the fields, with
impunity. Even the royal messengers (called mewrafys in
Gujrat) who carried Government Ietters, reports of spies, and
baskets of fruits for presentation to the Emperor, used to
rob the people of the villages they passecl by. In the trail
of the Maralha soldiers appeared the Beracds and even the
Pindaris—who were brigands pure and simple.

Then, there were the land-stewards of rival jagirdars,---
the incoming and the oulgoing--of the same village, Under
the plea of the never-to-be satisfied arrears of revenue, the
late javirdar’s collector tried to squeeze everything oul of the
peasantry before he lefl, and even continued {o stay in the
village for some months after the arrival of his successor.
And the new-comer, in order not to slatve himself, passed
the half-dead peasants through his fiscal grindiug-mill,

8 4. Bankruptcy of Mughal Government,

The English conquest of India was of a pulsatory
character ; “it was achieved not by an uninlerrupled succession
of advances, but each aggressive governor-ygeneral was
followed by a pacific economical nomninterventionist, A.
Warren Hastings filled the financial void created by the wars.

FINANCIAL RUIN OF MUGITAL EMPIRE 4AT

of Clive and Vansiltait, and laid the basis for the miliary
expansion of a Wellesley, while the bankruptcy caused by
Wellesley’s frenzy of conquest was repaired by the recupera-
tion of a sober plodding Barlow or Minto. The pacific
Bentinck undid the ravages in the Treasury made by the
bellicose Marquis of Hastings and Earl of Amherst Not so
Aurangzib. Ever since 1679, when he embatked on the
spoliation of the kingdom ‘of Marwar, his reign was one
tong warfare. [le did not realize the necessity of intervals
of peace and retrenchment, which would give breathing fime
to his subjects, recoup the losses of war, and lay by a reserve
for future wars. He soon ran through his current revenue,
the yield of the new tax (/az/ya) imposed on the Hindus in
1679, and even the accumulated treasures in the vaults of Agra
and Delhi forts.

Thus, the last reserve of the empire was exhausted, and
public bankruptcy became inevitable. The salaries of the
soldiers and civil officers alike fell into arrears for three years.
The men, starving from lack of pay and ihe exhaustion of
their credit with the local grocers, sometimes created scenes.
in the Emperor’s Court, sometimes abused and beat their
general’s business manager. The imperial Government made
reckless promises of money grant and high command fo -
every enemy captain who was induced to desert and every
enemy giladar who was persuaded to surrender his fort.
It was nol humanly possible to keep all of these promises.
The result was that the entire land in the empire proved
insufficient for the fotal amount of jagir needed to satisfy the
dues of all the officers included in the swollen army-list.
Iven when the grants of land in liew of salary were drawn
up by the Pay Office, ihey remained for years as mere orders
on paper, the actual delivery of the villages to the grantees
being impossible, The interval between the order and the
actual possession of the jagir, it was sarcastically said, was.

long enough to turn a boy into a grey-beard. Even a minot
Maratha hill-fort cost on an average Rs. 45,000 in cash lo
take it by bribing its qilacdar, and the Emperor might well
despair of taking all of them at this rale. And yet he
obstinately went on capturing fort after fort by heavy bribery
ot by regular sieges which were ten times more costly.

The spirit of the Mughal army in the Deccan was at last
utierly broken. The soldiers grew sick of the endless and
futile war but Aurangzib would fisten to no protest or
friendly advice. Even his grand wazir Asad Khan, who had
ventured to suggesi that now that Bijapur and Golkonda had
been conquered he had no more worl: lo do and might as
well return to Delhi, received a sharp reprimand, “I wonder
that a wise old servant like you bas made such a requesl.So
long as a single breath remains in this mortal body, there is no
release from labour.” A generation of imperial followers grew
up in the Deccan who had never entered a eily ov house of
brick or stone, but passed all their fives in tents, marching
from one encampment fo another. The Rajput soldiers
complained that lheir race would not be able to serve the
empire in the next generation, as they had to pass their life.

going home and rearing up children, One home-sick noble
offered the Emperor a bribe of one lakh of Rupees for

ijalent. Their best soldiers, highest officers, and all their
collected revenue were sent to the Deccan, while the subahs
of Ilindustan were henceforth left to be governed by minor
officers with small contingents and incomes quite inadequate
for maintaining viceregal authority. All classes of lawless
men began to raise their heads in the north as well as in the
south, though later and more fitfully in Hindustan than in
the Deccan, ‘The prottd zamindars, whose grand-fathers had
been ruling princes before the coming of the Mughals, the
Afghan families settled in various districts (especially Bengal,
Jaunpur, Malwa, Allahabad and North Orissa) and still
dreaming of their lost empire in India, claimants to principali-
ties dispossessed by order of Aurangzib, predatory tribes like
the Jat peasantry west of Agra and the Mewatis south-west of
Delhi, and turbulent Rajput villagers like the Bais of Oudh
and the Ujjainias of South Bihar,—~all rose in defiance of the
Government and began to lay hands on their weaker
neighbours. The local viceroys could not cope with them,
for, their income, inadequate even on paper for their heavy
duties, was actually dwindling very fast, The general unrest
naturally caused a falling off in the rent collection from the
peasants, It is difficult to imagine a system more ruinous to
the peasants and therefore in the long run more harmful to
the State algo, than the actual administration of Mughal
jagits. Tt ended in a mad looting of the peasanls by
rival jagirdars’ agents or successive agents of the same
jagirdar. “There is no hope of a jagir being left with the
same officer next year. When a jagirdar sends a collector
to his jagir, he first takes an advance from the latter
by way of loan. This collector, on arriving in the village,
fearing lest a second man who had given a larger loan to the
jagirdar wag following (to supplant him), does not hesitate to
collect the rent with every oppression. The ryots have given
up cultivation; the jagirdars do not get a penny.” (Bhimsen),
29

450 SHORT HISTORY OF AURANGZIB fou. XIX

The same ruinous policy was followed in revenue collection
in the Crownlands. [See my Studies in Mughal India, 223.
Thus, a vicious ciecle was formed: political disorder (to

—“which we must add a wrong system of land administration)
led to Jess and less money coming from the jagirs ; this
diminished income tloreed the governors to keep tewer and
fewer troops in their pay; the decrease in their armed strength
encouraged greater lawlessness among the people, from which
followed a further impoverishment of the peasants and falling
off in the land revenue.

War was the only occupation of the Rajputs and indeed of
all the Hindus who claimed to belong to the Kshatriya caste.
The Mughal peace established in northern India had felt to
them chances of employment only in the trans-frontier regions
on the west or in the still unsubdued paris of the Deccan.
Rajputs had fought under the imperial banner in Cenlral Asia
and Qandahar. But in Aurangezib’s reign Mughal military
activily was contracted within the frontiers, though Kabul was
still a part of his empire. His annexation of the remaining
Deccan principalities caused unemployment among the Rajpuls
in two ways,—first because he was under the necessity of
giving employment to the masterless local troops of the  sab-
verted monarchies, and secondly because fewer terrilories were
now feff for him to conquer. [n lhese circumstances aspiring
scions of Rajput houses could only fight with their kinsfolk
for theit ancestral “homes”, take to robbery, or apostalize in
order fo get grants of estates from Aurangzib.

§ 6. Decay of Indian civilization under Aurangesib,
its causes and signs.

The retrogression of mediceval Indian civilization under
Aurangzib is noticeable not only in the decline of the fine
arts, but still more in the low intellectual type of the new


--- Page 456 ---
HOPELESS DECLINE OF CIVILIZATION A514

generation. As the {7th century wore on, the older nobility

nourished on the manly traditions of Akbar and Shah Jahan,

gifled with greater independence of spirit, and trained with

greater resources and responsibility,—-gradually died out, and

their places in camp and Court were taken by smaller men,”
supplied wilh poorer resources by the suspicious Aurangzib,

afraid to exercise responsibility and initiative, and seeking to

advance themselves by sycophancy. The exceptionally pro-

longed life of Aurangzib with ifs ever increasing store of
experience and information, made him intellectually dwarf the
younger generation. His self-sufficiency and obstinacy increased
with age ; fill at last none dared to contradict him, none could
give him honest advice or impart unpleasant truth. With the
lack of leisure amidst the incessant warfare and rough camp-
life in the far off South, the culture of the aristocracy decayed,
and, as the nobles set the tone to society, the whole of the
intelleclual classes of India steadily fell back to a lower
fevel. A coarse Jafar Zatali took the place of a chaste Faizi for

their delectation.

The growing pessimism of the older men, which we find
reflecled in the letters and anecdotes of the time and even in
the works of thoughtful historians, bears witness to the moral
clecay of the governing classes, It was too deep and too
sincere to be set aside as an example of the familiar oriental
habit of imagining a golden age in the past and looking down
tipon the present generation as the degenerate successors of
their glorious ancestors. The historians Bhimsen and Khaff
Khan were struck by the hopeless change for the worse that
had seized the Indian world and looked wistfully back
at the virtues and glories of the men of the times of Akbar
and Shah Jahan. We find the aged Aurangzib himself dolefully
shaking his head over the prospect of the future and predicting
a deluge afer his death. It is true, as Sadullah remarked in
reply to a pessimist, “No age is without men of ability. What


--- Page 457 ---
459 SHORT HISIORY Ol AURANGZIB len, XIX

~

is needed is a wise master to find them out, cherish them, get
his work done by them, and never lend his ears to the
whispers of selfish men against such officers.” But this wise
principle was not followed in Aurangzib’s latter years, and it
was altogether discardel by his successors, Career was
not freely opened to talent. The public service was not
looked upon as a sacred trust, but as a means of gratifying
the apostate, the sycophan|, the well-groomed dandy, the great
man’s Rinsmen, and sons of old official families. Bigotry and
narrowness of oullook under Aurangzib and vice and sloth
under the later Mughals, ruined the administration of the
empire and dragged down the Indian people along with the
falling empire.

§ 7. Moral deyeneration of the Mughal avistocracy.

This moral decay was most noticeable among the nobility
and it produced the greatest mischief. The character of the
older nobility in the lale 47th century was deplorable, Ina
mean spirit of jealousy they insulled and thwarted “new men”
drawn from the ranks and ennobled for the most brilliant
public services, and yet they themselves had grown — utterly
worthless. We have a significant example of dhe moral
degeneration of the Mughal peerage. The prime miinister’s
grandson, Mirza}Tafakhkhur used to sally forth from his mansion
in Delhi with:his ruffians, plunder the shops in the bazar,
kidnap Hindu women passing through the public sireets in
litters or going to the river, and dishonour them ; and yet
there was no judge strong enough to punish him, no police
to prevent such crimes. “Every time such an occurrence was
brought to the Emperor's notice by the news-letters or official
reports, he referred it to the prince minister and did tlothing
more,”

All the surplus produce of a fertile land under a most
bounteous Providence was swept into the coffers of the


--- Page 458 ---
DEGENERACY OF MUGHAL NOBILITY 483

Mughal nobility and pampered them in a degree of luxury
not dreamt of even by kings in Persia or Central Asia. Hence,
in the houses of the Delhi nobility luxury was carried fo an
excess. The harems of many of them were filled with immense
numbers of women, of an infinite variety of races, intellect
and character. Under Muslim law the sons of concubines
are entilled to their patrimony equally with sons born in
wedlock, and they occupy no inferior position in society.
Even the sons of lawfully married wives became, at a
Precocious age, familiar with vice from what they saw and
heard in the harem, while their mothers were insulted by the
higher splendour and influence enjoyed in the same household
by younger and fairer rivals of servile origin or easier virtue.
The proud spitit and majestic dignity of a Cornelia are
impossible in the crowded harem of a polygamist ; and without
Cornelias among the mothers there cannot be Gracchi among
the sons,

There was no good education, no practical training, of t the”
sons ‘of the Mughal nobility. They were too ‘much petted 1 by
éunuchs and maid-servants and passed’ through a sheltered life
from birth lo manhood, every thorn being removed from
their path by attendants, Early familiarized with vice, softened
in their fibres by pleasure, they were yet faught to have an
inordinately high opinion of their own wealth and importance
in the scale of creation. Their domestic tutors were an
unhappy class, powerless fo do any good except by leave of
their pupils, brow-beaten by the eunuchs {with the support of
the ladies of the harem), disobeyed by the lads themselves,
and forced to cultivate the aris of fhe courtier and the sneak,
or to throw up their thankless office, The free give and take
life in a public school (which hardens character and at the
same time removes its angularities), the salutary discipline of
training as subalterns in an orderly army, were unknown to
the sons of the Mughal aristocracy. Hence, their moral


--- Page 459 ---
454 SHORT HISLORY OF AURANGZIS leu. XIX

decline was startlingly rapid and unchecked. Most of — them,
and even sons of Aurangzib like Shah Alam and Kam Bakhsh,
were beyond correction. As Aurangzib, worn out with giving
them unheeded counsels, cties out in despair, “I have
become a babbler by talking and talking; but none of you
have faken heed from my words.”

In addition io unbridled sexual licence ancl sceret drinking
and gambling, many members of the nobility and the middle
class were tainted by pederasty, a vice from which many of
the so-called saints were not free. All Aurangzib’s prohibitions
and all the activity of his Censors of Public Morals failed to
hold the Mughal aristocracy back from drink. The freale
pleasures and queer fancies of some of the nobles are noticed
in the confemporary accounts. (Manucci, iv, 254-6, 962.)

8 8, Popular superstitions,

*

All classes alike were sunk in the densest superstition,
Astrology governed every act of life among sich and poor
alike. Relie worship was universal among Uindus and Muham-
madans alike. Even the orthodox Aurangzib adored and
walked devoutly round the pretended footprints and hair of
the Prophet Muhammad (osor-i-sGaeif), as if these were
representations of the Deity. It is difficult to distinguish between
his altitude towards them and a Hindu’s worship of Vishnu’s
footmarks on stone. Man-worship of the grossest form degraded
the character of the masses. Besides the adoration of  gurtts
and mofants by Hindus and Sikhs, the Muslims, equally with
the members of thase two creeds, venerated saints and religious
mendicanls, and besought them 1o work miracles, and give
them atnulets, spells or marvellous medicine. Pretended
magicians did a roaring wade in these things, as well as in
the philosopher's stone,-~being patronized by the nobles as
well as the common people. Alchemy was believed to be

suipported and encouraged the professors of this art, even
undertaking to introduce them to the Emperor.

The darker aspect of the subject was not wanting, and we
read of human sacrifice being performed to aid the quest for
gold and the elixic witee, hough it was criminal in law and
punished whenever detected. Some Muhammadan doctors
used human fal to cure their patients. Hindu superstition is
further illustrated by the worship of long-armed men as inear~
nations of the monkey-god Hanuman.

As a natural consequence of their ignorance and pride,
all classes felt contempt for foreigners. [bt is true that European
gun-founders, artillerymen and doctors (a few) were patronized
by the wealthy, because their superior efficiency had been
demonstraled before thei! eyes; and European objecis of
luxury were eagerly bought But no attempt was made by
any Indian noble or scholar to learn European languages,” ’
arts or military system. A modern Indian nationalist will best
realize how blindly selfish and autocratic the Mughal Emperors
and the Indian aristocracy of the 16th and 17th centuries were, |
if he considers that while they spent lakhs of Rupees every
year in buying Buropean objects of luxury ot arl, not a single
printing-press, not even a lithographic stone, was imported
either for popular education or public business, "

The moral and intellectual tone of Indfan society was
greatly lowered by the abundance of slaves. In addition to
captives of war and vanquished families reduced to bondage,
men and women were sold by their parents for money in
farnine times, or in discharge of debts. A defaulting debtor

This was an ancient legal practice of the Hindus and
Muhammadans alike. One way ol! punishing criminals of
certain classes was to turn them Into slaves and sell them to
the public ; the sale of female slaves of this class is noticed
in the “Peshwas’ Diaries.” Slavery Hingered down to the — first
quarter of the 19th cenfury even in the British district ot
Purnia. [Martin's astern [ndia| People often made eunuchs
of their children and sold them; Orissa and Sylhet were
notorious for this offence, which was strongly condemned by
Aurangzib.

§ 9. Offtetal bribery ; life and character of the official world.

The educated middle class was composed entirely of
officials, if we except the handful of physicians and superior
priestly families. Among the traders and lesser landownecs
there were mang who ranked wilh the middie class in wealth,
bul not in educalion, nor did they ever cultivate literature.
The Mughal administration, both civil and military, could be
eatried on only with the help of a vast army of clerks and
accountanis. Their official pay was very low (like that of
the East India Company's factory ‘writers’ in the {7th
century).

But the exaction of official perquisites or gratuities from
men who had to get business pushed through the public
offices, was the universal and admitted practice, as in Tudor

vand Stuart England. In addition, many officials trom the
highest to the lowest took bribes for doing undeserved favours,
ot deflecting the course of justice. Official corruption was,
however, admitted in society to be immoral, and was practised
only in secrecy. There were many officers above corruption
even in Aurangzib’s reign. Bul the receiving and even
demanding of presents by men in power was ‘he universal

rule and publicly acknowledged.’ Even the Emperor was not
exempt from it Aurangzib asked an aspirant to a title, “Your
father gave to Shah Jahan one lakh of Rupees for adding

will you pay me for the title I am giving you ?”

The ministers and influential courtiers round the Emperor's
person had the opportunity of reaping a golden harvest, oy
selling to suitors their good offices in speaking for them to the
sovereign when in private attendance on him (fagacrub). Thus,
Qabil Khan in 242 years of personal attendance on Aurangeib
amassed {9 lakhs of Rupees in cash, besides arlicles of value
and a new house. They were besought and bribed with
presenis ancl money to yield their protection to officers, to
conceal the shortcomings (gfaib-pushi) of the latter, to
intercede for them with the Emperor (wastla), and in general
to watch over their inlerests at Court during their absence.
This pressure was passed from the Emperor downwards to
the peasant; each social grade trying to squeeze out of the
class below itself what it had to pay as present fo the rank
above il, the cultivator of the soil and the trader being the
victim in the last resort.

The drink habit was widely prevalent among the clerks,
both of the Kayastha and Khatri castes,~as well as among
the Rajput soldiers. In spite of the prohibition of the Quran,
the Muslim nobles and officers, both military and civil, were
in many cases addicted to it The Turks were specially
notorious for it The lower official class, on account of their
having to do their work far away from their homes, kept

of distance by railways and the moral reform cfiected by
English education and theistic religious movements in the
late 19th century, that put an end to this general immorality.

The clerks, both Hindus and Muhammadans, formed a
brotherhood bound together by comunity of culties and
interests, education and ideals, social life and even vices.
The official world was inspired by intense halred and con-
tempt for intruders inlo ils preserves. Offices were expected
to be reserved for old families of clerks and accountants,
Any official who was not a ‘hereditary servanl’ (€fanafizad)
of State but had sprung from the ranks, was clespised as a
noviumn fiomo used to be in the official world of the dying
republic of Rome. This atlittide was universal, from the higher
nobility to the petty clerks.

8 10, The purity and simple delights of the life of the masses.

The above picture of social life in Mughal India appears
very dark, anc must be declared incomplete and therefore
untrue, if we do nol consider certain other aspecls of iL We
are bound toe admit that among the teeming millions of the
Indian people domestic life was pure and not without its
simple colour and joy. This virtue alone saved the people
from the «doom of extinction which overtook the degenerate
Romans of the later empire, We had many popular songs,
ballads and storics, which assuaged the stricken haman soul,
faught heroic patience, and infused lenderness into the most
unlettered hearts. The epic of Tulsidas, which is even now
acted annually in every centre of population and recited in
every Hindu home in the Hindi-speaking provinces, filled
millions of our people with love of duty, mantiness, and the
spiril of self-sacrifice, and taught them wisdom in public and
private fife.

In Bengal, Tirhut, Orissa and Assam and certain other
parts, the Vaishnavism taught by Shankardey and Chaitanya

LIFE OF COMMON PEOPLE 459

introduced an unwonted gentleness and fervour, and tamed
lhe rude if manly savagery of the Tantric worship and
animism thal used to prevail there before, The 17th century
was the great period of the expansion of this new Vaishna~
vism,—which was marked by enthusiastic personal devotion
(as in the Christian revival movement), tenderness to children
and the weak, the cultivation of literature (both Sanskrit and
the current speech of the people), and the infusion of song
and dance and a delicate romantic sentiment into the everyday
life even of the poorest. It also bridged social gulfs and
established a democracy of the spirit. Apart from this new
popular religious literature, the masses* in different parts
hal their folk-songs, like the ballad of Ranjha and Hir (in
the Panjab), which went to their very hearts and relieved for
a lime the deadweight of labour and political tyranny which
pressed them down. The Kirtan or chorus-singing of religious
narratives in verse (interspersed with songs) was the universal
popular substitate for the sermon, the lecture, and literature
throughout India~in the souih as much as in the north.

The Mubammadans of that age (except the Hindi-speaking
portion) had no vernacular veligious poetry for ihe masse.
But they had the annual celebrations (urs) of different saints
at their lombs, which were altended by tens of thousands
of pilgrims from distances, and where fairs were held which
attracted men and women of all creeds, In addition, both
sexes dwelling in cities, had their usual weekly outing to the
gatden-tombs of saints in the suburbs. The opportunity was
utilized for pleasure rather than piely, and the spread of
immorality that if caused led Aurangzib (like Firuz Shah
Tughlaq before him) fe issue an order for slopping the
practice. But it was too popular to be put down. Visits to

these periodical faits and seats of pilgrimage were the sole
joy of the Indian village population, and men and women
were passionately cager to undertake them. Pilgrim-centres
like Ajmir, Kulbarga, Nizam-ucl-din Autiya, and Burhanpur for
the Muslims, and Mathura, Allahabad, Henares, Nasik, Madura
and Tanjore for the Tlindus, served also to cliffuse culture
and fo brealz down provincial isolation and uarrowness of

8 tt. Character of Autrangazib.

In the mediaeval world, and nowhere more so than in
India, the Ring was held responsible for the happiness of _ his
people, and with good reason. He was Gad’s representative
on earth, fovested with unlimited, unquestioned authorily and
the entire property in the lane. Therefore, when towards the
close of Aurangzib’s reign all things began to go wrong, the
contemporary historians turned {fo examine the Emperor's
character, in order to account for the cesiruction of — the
empire and of public peace.

Aurangaib was brave in an unusual degree. All the
Timurids, til the days of his unworthy great-grandsons, hacl
personal courage ; but in him this virtue was combined with
a coldness of temperament and a calculating spirit which we
have been taught to believe as the special heritage of the
taces of Notthern Europe. Of his personal fearlessness he
had given ample evidence from the age of fifteen, when he
faced a furious elephant unattended, to his 87ih year, when
he stood in the siege trenches before Wasingera. [lis calm
self-possession, his cheering words amidsl the thickest danger,
and his open defiance of death at Dharmat and Khajwa have
passed into the famous things of Indian history.

In addition to possessing constitutional courage and  cool-
ness, he had early in life chosen the perils and labour of
Ringship as his vocation and prepared himself for this sovereign

office by self-reverence, self-knowledge, and — self-control.
Unlike other sons of monarchs, Aurangzib was a widely read
and accurale scholar, and he kept up his love of baoks to
his dying day. Even if we pass over the many copies of the
Quran which he wrote with his own hand, as the mechanical
industry of a zealof, we cannot forget that he loved to devote
the seanty leisure of a very busy tuler to reading Arabic works
on jurisprudence and theology, and hunted for rare old MSS.
of books like the Nefayya, the Afiya-ul-ulum, and the
Diwan-i-Saib with the passion of an idle bibliophile. His
extensive correspondence proves his mastery of Persian poetry
and Arabic sacred literature, as he was ever ready with apt
quotations for embellishing almost every one of his letters,
In addition to Arabic and Persian, he could speak Turki and
Hindi freely. To his initiative and patronage we owe the
greatest cligest of Muslim law made in India, which rightly
beats his name,—the Fatawa-t-Alamgiti and which simplified
and defined Islamic justice in India ever after,

Besides beok-learning, Aurangzib had from his boyhood
cultivated control of speech and action, and tact in dealing with
others. As a prince, his tact, sagacity and humility made the
highest nobles of his father’s Courthis friends ; and as Emperor
he displayed the same qualities in a degree which would have
heen remarkable even in a subject. No wonder that his con-
temporaries called him “a darvis6 clad in the imperial purple.”

Wis private life—dress, food and recreations,—were all
extremely simple, but well-ordered. [He was absolutely free
from vice and even from the more innocent pleasures of
the idle ich. The number of his wives fell short even of the
Quranic allowance of four,” and he was scrupulously _ faithful

will smile to learn—were the acid fruit corinda (Carissa
carandas) and a sort of chewing gum called  &Aardali
His industry in administration was marvellous. [n addition to
regularly holding daily Courts (sometimes twice a day) and
Wednesday trials, he wrote orders on letters and petitions
with his own hand and dictated the very language of official
replies. The Italian physician Gemeli Careri thus describes the
Fmperor giving public audience (21 March 1695): “Ie was ot
a tow stature, wilh a large nose, slender and stooping with age.
The whiteness of his round beard was more visible on his
olive-coloured skin... 1 admired to see him endorse the petitions
lof those who had business] with his own hand, wilhout
spectacles, and by his cheerful smiling countenance seem to
be pleased with the employment.”

llistorians have observed that though he died in his 90th
year, he retained to the last almost all his faculties unimpaired.
His memory was wonderful: “he never forgol a face he had
onec seen ora word that he had once heard.” All his
physical powers retained their vigour fo the end, if we except
a slight deafness of the ear, which afflicted him in old age,
and a lameness of the right leg, which was due to his doctor’s
nuskilful treatment of an accidental clislocation.

§ 12. His besetting sin of over-centratization : its disastrous
effects on the administration.

But all this long self-preparation and splendid vitality, in
one sense provecl his undoing, as they naturally begot in him
a self-confidence and distrust of others, a passion for seeing
everything carried to the highest perfection according to his
own idea of it—-which urged him to order and supervise every
minute detail of administration and warfare personally. This
excessive interference of the head of the Stale kep! his
vieeroys and commanders and even “the men on the spol”

LACK OF TRUE STATESMANSHIP 463

in tar off districts in perpetual tuiclage; their sense of
responsibility was destroyed, initiative and rapid adaptability to
a changing environment could not be developed in them,
and they tended to sink into lifeless puppets moved to action
by the master pulling their strings from the capital. No surer
means than this could have been devised for causing
administrative degeneration in an extensive and diversified
empire like India. High-spirited, talented and energetic officers
found themselves checked, discouraged and driven to sullen
inactivity. With the death of the older nobility, outspoken
responsible advisers disappeared from his council, and
Aurangzib in his latter years, like Napoleon | after the climax
of Tilsit, could bear no contradiction, could hear no un-
palatable trath, but surrounded himself with “smooth-tongued
sycophants and pompous echoes of his own voice.” His
ministers became no betier than clerks passively registering
his edicts. ‘

Such a king cannot be called a political or even an
administrative genius. He had merely honesty and plodding
industry. He was fit lo be an excellent departmental head,
not a stalesman initiating a new policy and legislating with
prophelic foresight for moulding the life and thought of
unborn generalions in advance. That genius, though unlettered
anc often hot blooded, was Akbar alone among the Mughals
of India.

vances of his religion. He thus became an ideal character

himself favoured this idea by his acts. Politically, therefore,

Aurangztb with all his virtues was a complete failure. But the
cause of the failure of his reign lay deeper than his personal
character. Though ft is not true that he alone caused the fall
of the Mughal empire, yet he did nothing to avert it, but rather
quickened the destructive forces already in operation in the
land. And these | shall examine now.

§ 13. rue chatacter and aim of the Mughal Governnint.

The Mughal empire did much for India in many ways. But
it failed to weld the people into a nation, or to create a strong
and enduring State.

The glitter of gems and gold in the Taj Mahal or the
Peacocle Throne, ought not to blind us to the fact that in
Mughal India man was considered vile ;-—~the mass of the people
hacl no economic liberty, no indefeasible right lo justice or
personal freedom, when their oppressor was a noble or — high
official or landowner; political righls were not dreami of.
While the nation at large was no better than human sheep,
the siatus of the nobles was hardly any higher under a strong
and clever king; they had no assured constitutional position,
because a conslitution did not exist in the scheme of govern-
ment, nor even had they full right to their material acquisifions.
All depended upon the will of the autocrat on the throne.
The Government was in effect despotism tempered by  revolu-
fion or the fear of revolution. The whole power and all the
resources of a country produce a Courl—-the centre of the
Court is the prince ; finally, then, the ultimate product of all
this gathered life is the self-sulficiency of the sovereign.

In Mughal India, as in all other absolute monarchies,
popular happiness even under the best of sovereigns was
unstable, because it depended upon the character of one man.
“The Mughal system of education and training entirely failed
fo maintain a line of promising heirs-apparent. , . As the princes
grew up, the jealousy of rival queens forbade thelr taking a

MUSLIM THEORY OF GOVERNMENT DEFECTIVE 4635

leading part in the politics of the capital... A prince who
took his proper part in the council of the State was suspected
of intriguing against the monarch... Hereditary succession is
only tolerable under a system where the responsibility falls on
a ministry, which screens the viclousness or incompetence of
the occupant of the throne” “Such a ministry the Mughals
were never able to organize. The monarch was obliged to fall
back on lhe mob of adventurers who crowcled round his
davbar,... whose function was more to amuse their master
than to acl as a modern Cabinet... It was never the Mughal
poliey to foster the growth of a hereditary aristocracy.” [Crooke].

By its theory, Islamic Government is mililary rule—the
people are the faithful soldiers of Islam, the Emperor (Kfalifa)
is their commander. In an army it is not for the officers, any
more than for the privates, to reason why or to seek reply
from the supreme leader. The Khalifa-Emperor js the
sihoucte of God (ail-subAani), and in Godl’s Court there is
no “why or how.’ No more could there be in the Padishah’s
administration, which was a sample of God’s Court (namuna~
i-darbat-inilahi, By the basic principle of Islamic Government,
the Hindus and other unbelievers were admittedly outside the
pale of the nation, But even the dominant sect, the Muslims,
did not form a nation; they constituted a military brotherhood,
a perpetual camp of soldiers.

8 (4. Difference in life and ideal makes fusion of Hindus and
Mufammadans impossible,

According to the root principles of Muslim polity, there
can be no political rights for minorities, the nation must be
merged in the dominant sect, and a community homogeneous
in creed and social life must be created by crushing out all
divergent forms of faith, opinion and life. The nation as 4
purely political creation was inconceivable and impossible in
such a state of things. The evil was aggravated by the fact

30


--- Page 471 ---
166 SHORI INSTORY OF AURANGZIP {cu XI

that in India the politically depressed class or “official
minority’ was a numerical majority, ottinumnbering — the
dominant sect as three to one, and at the same time economi-
cally better qualified, stronger in capital and weallh-producing
power, and not inferior in intellect or physical vigour.

No fusion between the two classes was possible even
with the passage of centuries, as they differecl fike opposite
poles in ideal and fife. The Hinclu is solilary, passive,
other-worldly ; his highest aim is scll-realization, the
altainment of personal salvation by inclividual effort, private
devotions, and lonely austerities. To him birth is a misfortune
and his fellow-beings so many sources of distraction from his
one true goal. Not by enjoyment of Gods gifts but by renuncia.
tion, not by joyous expansion bul by repression of  etnotion,
is he to attain to true bliss. The Muslim, on the other hand, is
taught to feel that he is nothing if not a soldicr of the militant
force of Islam ; he must pray in congregation; be must give
ptoof of the sinccrity of his faith by underlaking fad or
active exertion for the spread of his religion and the destruc.
fion of unbelief among other men. Ile is a missionary, and
cannet be indifferent to the welfare of his neighbours’ souls;
nay, he must be ever alive to his cluly of promoting the
salvation of others by all meaus at his command, physical as
much as spicitual. Then, again, Islam boldly avows thal
it is good for us to be here, that God has given the
world to the faithful as ati inheritance for their enjoyment.

The practical outlook and social solidarity of the Muslims
have made them develop the arts anc civilization (excepling
literature) in a much higher degree than the Windus; their
pleasures are of a more varied and elegant kind, and the
Tlindu aristocracy in Mughal times were only clumsy — iimilators
of the Muslim peers, The general type of the Muhammadan
population (excepting beggars and menial labourers) are
more refined and accustomed toa costlier mode of life, while


--- Page 472 ---
POLITICAL DEGRADATION OF HINDUS AGT

Hindus of the corresponding classes, even when rich, are
grosser and less cultured. The lower classes of the Hindus how-
ever, are distinctly cleaner and more intellectual than Muslims
of the same grades of life.

§ 15. Hindus politically depressed and degraded
under Aurangzib.

Apart from the restrictions about food, difference of
religious doctrine and ritual, rules forbidding intermarriage, &c.,
this polar difference in their outlook upon life made a fusion
between Hindus and Muslims impossible. In addition to these,
the Quranic polity made life intolerable for the Hindus under
orthodox Muhammadan tule, Aurangzib furnishes the best
example of the effects of that polity when carried to its
logical conclusions by a king of exemplary morality and
religious zeal, without fear or favour in discharging what he
held to be his duty as the first servant of God. Schools of
Hindu learning were broken up by him, Hindu places of
worship were demolished, Hindu fairs were forbidden, the
Uindu population was subjected to special fiscal burdens in
addition to being made to bear a public badge of inferiority;
and the service of the State was closed {to them, as we have
seen in Gh. WIL

Thus, the only life that the Hindu could lead under
Aurangzib was a life deprived of the light of knowledge,
deprived of the consolations of religion, deprived of social
union and public rejoicing, of wealth and the self-confidence
thal is begotten by the free exercise of natural activities and
use of opportunities—~in shorl, a life exposed to constant
public humiliation and political disabilities. Heaven and earth
alike were closed to him as long as he remained a Hindu.
Ilence, the effect of Aurangzib’s reign was not only to goad
the Hindus into constant revolt apd’ disturbances but also to
make them deteriorate in intellect, organization, and economic


--- Page 473 ---
468 SHORT HISTORY Ob AURANGZIB Jou. XIX

resources, and thereby weaken the Stale of which they formed
more than two-thirds of the man-power.

§ 16. Decline of the Muslims in India; tts causes.

The Muslim portion of the population, loo, did not prosper
under such a polity, though for a different reason. The Turks
are soldiers anc nothing else ; their manhood is a naturally
embodied army, and war is their only profession. A standing
army is necessarily prevented = from cultivating continuous
domestic life. The ruling race among the so-called Mushals
were really Turks. Hence, Muslim society in the Mughal period,
in many of its civilian ranks also, frequently displayed garrison
manners, as the organization of their Government was of a
military type and the soldiers set the fone lo society.

The intellectual decline of the Muslims was hastened by
the peculiar position of the faithful in India. They had made
India their permanent home ; many of them were Indians by
race ; and all had become so in their personal appearance,
thoughts, manners and customs. And yet lheir religious;
teachers urged them lo look back to aneient Arabia and
draw their mental sustenance from the far off age ol the
Prophel. The languaye of their religion must be Arabic,
which nol one in a hundred among the Muslims of Inclia fully
understood ; their cultural language was Persian, which a
few more learnt with difficulty and used with an impurity thal
excited the latghter and scorn of the Persian-born. The
Inclian Muslim considered it beneath his dignity (ill well into
the 18th century) to use the vernacular for literary purposes.
Hence, the immense majorily of this sect were without any
literature of their own; their education was hampered and
their private life (except in the case of the few who could
use Persian freely) was deprived of intellectual joys. They
could not have even a? Uving growing religious literature.
Hindustani amalory or devotional songs and Suff verses

INDIAN MUSLIMS WHY UNPROGRESSIVE 469

in Persian were not adequate instruments for the diffusion of
culture or the removal of general ignorance among a whole
communily.

Thus, the orlhodox Muslim ever felt that he was in India,
but nof of if He durst not, for perif to his soul--so he
was faught,—strike his roots deep into his native soil. He
must not take to his heart its traditions language and cultural
products; he must import these from Persia and Arabia,
Even his civil and crimiual law must be derived from the
writings of jurists and the decisions of judges in Baghdad
or Cairo. The Muslim in India was an intellectua! exotic ;
he could not adapt himself to his environment. The Quranic
precepts for the guidance of civil society and the regulation
of human conduct and relations, were framed in a far off
age for a nomadic people. It was absurd, so a rationalist
like Akbar argued, that they should be considered binding
on men of the (6th or 17th century living in a country that
had nothing in common with Arabia.

The intellectual vacuity caused by this unnatural straining
after a foreign and impracticable ideal, not only arrested the
mesial and social progress of the Indian Muslims, but also
made their hearts a fertile soil for noxious weeds. The
elernal human craving for a personal religion, for a living
faith, could not be satisfied by repeating an Arabic book by
role (Aifst-kalan-ullah), ot by going through one mono-
tonous physical drill five limes a day in a public gathering
(fama). ‘The thirsty soul turned to every fabled living saint
in its neighbourhood and to the greedy ‘successors in
altendance at the jombs of famous saints of the past,—both of
whom were believed to be capable of working miracles.

The racial character of the Semitic peoples who created
the Quran and Sunni Canon Law was essentially different
from that of the Indians, and the mere fact of a body of the
latter race having accepted the religion of the Arabs could


--- Page 475 ---

not counteract this ethnic difference. These were insurmount-
able handicaps io Indian Islam.

§ 17. Deterioration and infierent weakness of Hindu
soctely.

The Hindus of tmediaval India presented an equally un-
happy spectacle. They could not possibly form a nalion,
or even one compact sect. A social solidarity Tike that of
the Muhammadans was inconceivable among a people divided
into coutitless mutually exclusive castes, with their rancorous
disputes about tights to the sacred thread and the Vedic
chant, access to public water-supplics and temples, besides
fouckabiltty, and in Southern India also approachabiltly, And
lime and prosperity seemed only to aggravale these differences.

f'Caste grows by fission,” and the multiplication of new subs
castes was in active progress through the operation of inicrnal
forees during Mubammadan rule, dividing and weakening
Hindu society still further,

No enlightened or patriotic priesthood arose to save lhe
Hindu peoples. The separatist tendency is as strong in their
religion as in their society; and, indeed, an ovgatized
priesthood or Stale Church is opposed to the root principles
of the Hindu scheme of salvation, Stray sheep running afler
stray shepherds fall easy victims to the quack and the
voluptuary. Even if we pass over the degrading forme of
man-worship thal marked the religious practices of lhe
Vallabhacharya, Kartabhaja and other sects of gurt-adorers,
or the licentiousness promoted by temple dancers (deradeasts
ot murelis) and small peuricnt esoleric sects, and turn our
eyes fo the ordinary idol-worship of the inilfions, we find
ithe priesthood bringing their worshippers down to the lowest
intellectual level by holding up to their adoration a god
who eats, sleeps, falls ill of fever (as Jagannath does for a
week every year), or ptirsues armorous dalliances which a Nawab

harem. Reform was possible only outside the regular Hindu
Church followed by the masses—i ¢, among the small
non-conforming secls, where men weré prepared to leave all
things and follow truth; but, even there, only during. the first
generation or two affer their foundation, before they too
sank into gross gure-worship.

8 18. How Hindus and Muslims lived together in India;
occasional union, latent danger of fight

In spite of what has been ‘said before, Hindu and
Muhammadan ‘societies often touched .each other at certain
points. The true ideals of both creeds were the same, namely,
the worship of one Supreme Being, abstinence from - earthly
joys, ténderness to all creatures. But bigots and the mass
of ordinary people could-not rise to such a high -plane of
thought. Muslim saints, famous: for striking acts of self-
tnortifleation or mitacle-working power, were often. adored by

was slatic. With the leas! change in the relative streneth of
the two secls or in their temper, with the visil of an active
orthodox preacher from outside or the accession of a bigol
to the throne, the sleeping veleano of mob passions would
again wake to fury. Uxamnples of il are furnished by the
massacre of the Shias at Srinagar in 1685, the destruction and

Asia by the European nations,—which is only another way of
saying that the progressive taces are supplanting the conser~
vative ones, just as enterprising families are constantly replacing
sleepy self-satisfied ones in the leadership of our own society.”

§ 90. The significance of Aurangzib’s tefgn: flow an
Indian nationality can be formed.

The detailed study of this long and strenuous reign of fifty
years drives one truth home into our minds. If India is ever to
be ihe home of a nation able to keep peace within and guard the
frontiers, develop the economic resources of the country and
promote art and science, then both Hinduism and Islam must die
and be born again, Each of these creeds must pass through a
rigorous vigil and penance, each must be purified and
rejuvenated under the sway of reason and science. That such
a rebirih of Islam is not impossible, has been demonstrated in
our own days by the conqueror of Smyrna, Ghazi Mustafa
Kainal Pasha has proved that the greatest Muslim Slate of the
age can secularize its constiiation, abolish polygamy and the
servile seclusion of women, grant political equality to all creects,
and yet not ceasé to be a land of Islam.

But Aurangzib did not attempl such an ideal, even though
his subjects formed a very composite population, even though
the entire Indian world lay at his feet and he had no European
rivals hungrily watching to seize his kingdom. On the contrary;
he deliberately undid ihe beginnings of such a national and
rational policy which Akbar had set on foot,

Ilistory wheo rightly read is a justification of Providence,
a revelation of a great purpose fulfilled in time. The failure
of an ideal Muslim king like  Aurangeib, with all the
advaniages he possessed at his accession and his high moral

THE EMPIRE OF AURANGZIB : ITS RESOURCES,

8 1. he Empire: its extent and revenue.

At the death of Aurangzib (1707), his empire consisted
of 21 subafs or separate provinces, of which 14 were. situated
in Ifindustan or Northern India, six in the Deecan, and one
(namely, Kabul) in what now forms Afghanistan. Their names

Qa. «Subabs of Hindustan—Agra, Ajmir, Allahabad, Bengal,
Bihar, Delhi, Gujrat, Kashmir, Lahor, Malwa, Multan, Orissa,
Qudh, and Tatta (or Sindh),

(i) Subafs of the Deccan—Khandesh, Berar, Aurangabad
(old Ahmadnagar), Bitar (old Telingana), Bijapur, and
tHaidarabac. A century earlier, “ @, at the end of Akbar’s
reign (1605), the Mughal empire bad embraced all the fourteen
subahs of Hindusian and only the first two of the above
provinces of ithe Decean,—the annexation of Ahmadnagar
by Akbar being nominal, Qandahar or South, Afghanistan Was
long entered in the official records ag a subah of ‘the Mughal
empite, but it was in name only, as ft frequently changed
hands between the kings of Persia and Delhi and was finally
lost fo the Mughals in 1649; it was even at the best of
times a barren possession anda very losing concern. Kabul
ot North Afghanistan, though held by the Mughal Emperors
til its annexation by Nadir Shah ° (1739), had a revenue of
only 90 laklis of Rupees in Akbar’s time and 40 lakhs in
Aurangzib’s reign, much of which was often unrealizéd,
So, we shail leave these two provinces of Afghanistan out
of ow consideration in this chapter.

A76 SHORE IWSTORY OF AURANGAIN feu, XX

The Mughal empire under Aurangzib included in the
north Kashmir and all Afghanislan south of the Hinduleash ;
on the south-west a line 36 miles soul of Ghazni separated
it from the Persian kingdom. On the west coast il strelehed
in theory up to the northern frontier of Goa ans inland to
Belgaon (in the Bombay Karnatak or Kanara) and the
Tungabhadea river. Thereafier the boundary passed west to
east in a disputed and ever shifling fine through the centre
of Mysore, dipping sotth-easlwards fo the Koleran river
(north of Tanjore) In the extreme north-east, lhe river
Monas (west of Gauhati) divided the empire from the
independent kingdom of Assam. But it should be always
borne ity mind thal in the south-west, south and south-east,
te, throughout Maharashtra, Kanara, Mysore and the
Eastern Karnalak, the Lmperor’s rule was disputed and most
places had to obey a double set of masters or spofiators
(do-amli),-—as the English and Prench factory reeeards painfully
illustrate.

lxeluding Afghanistan, the Mughal empire had a revenue
of Rupees (3 roves and Gi fvkAs under Akbar, and 33
keores and 25 fakfs under Aurangsib. This was the standard
or maximum State demand from land, but this amount was
never fully realized and the actual collection often fell very
short of i This figure stood for the fand revenue alone
and did not inelude the proceeds of laxes Tile the scat
(one-forticth of the annual income of Muslims, la be spent
solely in religious charity) and faxtya. A rough idea of the
proportion of the different sources of Stale-ineome can be
formed from the figures for Gujral in Aurangzib’s reign : -
Jand revenue Rs. 113 lakhs, /aziya 3 talkhs, customedulies of
Surat port alone 12 lakhs per annum. (The other ports
did negligible irade, except Masulipalam and Mughlt towards
the end of the reign). The amounts of land held as mililary
fief (fagir) and Crownland (4éalsa sharif) can be judged

from the following figures (circa 1690): land revenue assessed
on fairs 97°64 Rrores and on &falsa 35'S! krores of Rupees
(for lhe whole empire).

$2 The Official peerage.

‘ The government both civil and military was conducted by
means of officials entered in the army-list and graded in
successive rauks (mansab) from commanders of (nominal)
twenty thousand horse down to commanders of twenty
lin Akbar’s reign len] men only. Of these, all who held any
vrade from 3 fuzar? upwards were called grandees (amara~i~
e2@am or grand commanders), and those below the command
of 5000 horse (nominal) were styled simply mansabdars or
*

officers.)

Number of
Grandees (2. e, 3-Aaxari

pcinces) was bes 63 112 9-99 —

Tolal, including both wnara
and mansabdats ... saa 1,803 9945 8000 14,449

Prom the above we can see the enormous inflation of
the army-list under Aurangzib and the heavy financial burden
that it produced,

Out of the 14,449 mansabdars under Aurangzib, about 7,000
were fagitdars and 7,450 were nagd? (or paid in cash), 7 e,
nearly half and half. The annual salary and allowances of
the mansabdars, including the pay of their troops (who,
under Shah Jaban’s rule, had to be actually at least one«
fourth of the nominal number of their grade) were as follows,
for the first class in each grace :

--- Page 485 ---
478 SUORE HISTORY OF AURANGZIB [cu XX

The actual armed strength of the empire in 1647 was

9 lakhs of troopers brought to the muster and
branding,

8 thousand ntansabdars,

7 thousand afadis and bargandaxes,

1,85,000 fabinan or adklilional troopers of — the
princes, amara and mansabdarts,~ and

40,000 footmusketcers, gunners, and rockel-men,

These numbets underwent a slill further inerease with
Aurangzib’s fresh warfare and annexations in the Deccan,
lill at last his finances hopelessly broke down under the
army bill, ?

In the Mughal empire there prevailed what Bernier calls
“the barbarous and ancient e¢ustom” of the sovereign contfis-
cating fhe property of every one who died in his service,
In other words, there was no hereditary property among the
nobility, but the Emperor always look possession of the
treasures and houses of his noblemen on their death and
made a sift to their children of only what he pleased ; the
heirs hac no fegal right lo their fathers’ legacy. The result
was verg harmful lo the State and to Indian civilization,
The nobles lived extravagantly and squandered their all on
luxury, as they knew that they coulkl leave nolhing to their
fainily and that the Emperer alone would profit by their
frugality. Again, the inseeurily of the nobles’ fortunes
prevenled the accumulation of private capital and the economic
growth of the country which depends on capital. The general
level of civilization and culture, foo, was lowered, because
each generation had to work .from the bottom upwards,
instead of benefiting by the acquisilions auc progress achieved
by ils predecessor.

The political effect of this escheal syslem was most
disastrous ; it prevented Incia from having one of the slrongest
checks on royal atttocracy, namely, Ao independent hereditary


--- Page 486 ---
BAD EFFECTS OF ESCHEAT SYSTEM 479

peerage, whose position and wealth did not depend on the
king’s favour in every generation and who could therefore
afford fo be bold in their opposition to royal tyranny, H
also made the Mughal nobility a selfish band, prompt in
deserting to lhe winning side in every wat of succession or
foreign invasion, because they knew that their fands and
even personal property were not legally assured ito them,
but depended solely on the pleasure of the de facto king,
Mediaeval India had no independent nobility or powerful
trading class to act asa barrier between the omnipotent
Emperor at the top and the countless poor peasants and
labourers at the bottom. Such a Government is most
unstable and unsound.

8 3. Manufactures and trade.

The Mughal Governmenl was ils own manufacturer, in
Slate factories called farekhanafis, for large quantities and
an immense variety of articles. These have been described
in detail in my book Mughal Administration, Ch. X (State
Industries”), The private industries of the various provinces
are enumerated separately in my Jdia of Aurangzib. Foreign
trade, however, occupied a negligible position in the economies
ot the Mughal empire, on account of its small volume,—the
total yield of the import duty being prebably less than 30
lakhs of Rupees a year, while the fand revenue brought to
ithe State one hundred and eleven times that amount) As
Bernier acutely observes: “Nor can the commerce of a
country so governed be conducted with the activity and
success that we witness in Europe... In case, indeed, where
the merchant is protected. by a military man of rank, he may
be induced to embark in commercial enterprises ; but still
he must be the slave of his patron, who will exact whatever
terms he pleases as the price of his protection.”


--- Page 487 ---
480 SHORT HUSTORY OF AURANGZIB fou, XX

The value of the Indian produets exported by the English
8. L Company during the first sixty years of ils trade (1619-
1679), did not average more than a hundred thousand pounds
(or eight lakhs of Rupees) per annum, [In (681 it rose to
£930,000 for Bengal alone]. While the trade of the Dutch
Company with India was at this fime probably at feast as
large as that of the English Company, the trade of the
Porluguese was certainly smaller, There is no evidence to
show that any very considerable volume of trade by sea
was in the hands of native merchants, bul a small amount
of traffic continued to be carried on by the overland route
{o Persia and Turkey fand also Tibet] The feel is that the
people of India at that lime oblained lille by international
exchange except precious metals together wilh a few articles
of tucury enjoyed by the ich. These imports were in the
main paid for by her export of cotton goods, supplemented
by a small variety of raw produce stich as pepper, indigo,
and saltpetre. India was thas cconomically almost self-
supporting, [C. J. Hamillon, 59-33].

The low range of import duties [namely, 34/2 per cet
ad valorem, of which 1 p. «& was for the jaziyal imposed by
the Mughal Emperors proves thal there was a general desire
fo encourage foreign trade. There was no question of an
atiemp! to protect native manufactures [by prohibitive import
duties]. The export trade seems fo have been approved [by
the Delhi Government] as the recognized means for obtaining
a supply of the precious metals and of articles of luxucy
consumed at the Court’ [C, J. [amillon, 90).

The Engligh EB. I. Co’s trade with the East during fhe first
half of the 17th century was to a large extent confined to
dealings in five classes of goods, .In the [English martet the
products most sought for were the spices from the Archipelago
and the Spice Islands, the raw sil€ of Persia, and the salipetre
and indigo of India. No doubt a fair quantity of the finer

cS

IMPORTS INTO MUGHAL INDI\ 481

coffon cloths, as also a small quantity of manufactured silk
goods, were imported into England. But, for the most part
the Company’s purchases of cotton goods were made not for
import into England, but for the markets of the Further East
and of Persia. India, indeed, possessed almost a monopaly in
the manufacture of colton goods, in foreign markets, .. .but
she had nol even a considerable export trade in silk goods.
Raw silk came [to England] chiefly from Persia and from
China, while even in the first half of the 17th century, China
supplied the grealer part of the manufactured silk articles
imported into England. {C. J. Hamilton, 31-39],

‘The chief imports into Inciain the Mughal fimes wete sifver
and gold (in specie), and to a lesser extent copper and lead.
We were practically dependent upon foreign countries for
these metals, though not for fron anc steel—which fast were,
however, imporled as cheaper}, For high class woollen clothing
Rurope (notably France) was our sole supplier, and large
quantities of imported broadeloths and other woollen fabrics
(Arabic segatlat, scarlet) were consumed in India by the Court
and the rich. Next in value were horses, of which large
numbers came by ship from the Persian Gulf and by the
fand-route from Khurasan Central Asia and Kabul through the
northwestern passes. Hill ponies (called fargan or gaunt) were
imported from the Eastern Himalayan States, Tibet and Bhutan,
through Bengal, Kuch Bihar, Morang and Qudh. Large
quantities of fruits—fresf in winler and dry all the year round,
were consumed in Upper India, and came from Central Asia,
Alghanislan and Persia. Spices (such as cloves, nutmegs,
cinnamon and cardamom) were supplied by the Dutch from
the Spice Islands, which had a monopoly of these commodities.
Articles of luweury like musk and porcelain came from China,
pearls from Bahrain (Persian Gulf) and Ceylon, elephants from
Pegu and Ceylon, superior brands of tobacco from America,
glass-ware wine and curiosilies from Europe, and slaves from

their high price and limitect consumption. The European
Companies very oceasionally soll artillery and munitions Cn
small quantitics) to our local rulers, in their sudden need, but
there was no regular [rade in these thines and, indeed,
the transactions were mostly done in secret as unlawful. A
thin stream of traffic enlered India from the Mimalayan regions
by way of Oudh (and later throush Patna) ; they brought lo
us, loaded on ponies and shecp (), small quantities of gold,
copper, musk and the tail of the yak cow (lor use as fans
or fly-whiskers), and also spare hill-ponies; and after selling
them took back sali, colton, olass-ware, cle. European paper,
imported by the Portuguese and tater by the Duteh (but still
popularly called ‘Portugal paper’), was largely constimed by
the independent Sultans of the Deccan, Dut the Murshal
Emperors had their own tactaries for very fine paper (iow
known in Europe as ‘India paper’) in Kashmir and a few
other places, while the nels of ordinary office work and
private persons weresupplied by a class of Muslim manufacturers
(ealled kay Goes) who plied their industey in every town, with
a special suburb (owed) of their own uear the capitals.

Our most imporlant exports in those days were common
cotton cloth (called caficoes), cither plain or printed (esate),
which were largely consumed in the Indian Archipelago, and
towards the close of the 17th century in England also,- - muslin
or very fine cotton fabrics,~ and raw products Tike sallpetray
indigo silk and pepper (besiles cerlain other cooling spices).
Small quantities of white sugar were exported from ugh,
diamonds and rubies via Masulipalam, slaves from Bengal anid
Madras, and also cotton yarn tor making candlowieks in
England, Towards the end of the century silk faffelas and
brocades began to be exporled in larger quantilies, and a
distinct improvement in the dyeing and weaving of silk was
effected in Bengal by the English Company. The whole

Madras coast from Masulipatam to Pondicherry, (and next, but
far behind it, Kanara or the country from Hubli to Karwar)
were the seals of the most productive cotton industry in India;
but the wars following the overthrow of the Golkonda
sullanale and the rise of the Marathas, completely ruined these
regions and the primacy in collon manufacture passed on to
Bengal af the beginning of the 18th century.

8 4. The admintstrative system.

The Muslim State was essentially a military Government and
suet for iis very existence on the absolute authority of
the monarch, who was also the supreme Commander of the
Faithful in war\ He had no regular council of ministers, The
waele or dean was the highest officer below the Emperor,
and the other ministers were in no sense his colleagues but
adinilledly inferior to him. Many important questions were
decide by the Emperor and the wazit alone without the
lnowledge of the other ministers. But none of the ministers,
not even the wagir bimself, could serve as a check on the
royal will; their office depended entirely on his caprice. They,
lherefore, could not form a Cabinet in the modern sense of
the term, Every Muslin sovereign is, in strict theory, the head
of the Church and ihe State alike; he is the Kfelifa of the
age to his subjects. ,

The chief departments of the Mughal administration were :
yj & The Exchequer and Revenue (under the Divan or

_ Chancellor).

: 9, The Imperial Household (under the Kian-t-saman or

i {figh Steward).

| 3. The Pay and Accounls office (under the Bokhshi or
Paymaster).

4, Canon Law (under the Qazi of Qaxis.)

8, Religious endowments and charily (under the Sadr of
Sadrs).

6. Censorship of Public Morals (uncer the MuAtasib),

Inferior to these, but ranking almost like departments,
were

7. The Artillery (under the Avie Atésh), and

8. Intelligence and Posts (under the arogha of
Dakchanki).

The Imperial Diwan received all revenue papers and despatches
from the provinees and field armies, and decidedt all questions
connecled wilh the collection or assessment of fhe revenue.
He also appointed and controlled the diwans of alf the provinces,
Ail orders of payment had to be signed by him. He wrole
letters “by order” (fasdl-Adkm) in his own person to
communicate the Emperor's wishes, and offen draflecd royal
letters to important persons and foreign rulers,

The salary bills of all officers -both civil ancl military
(because both were alile maascbidats) -fad to be calculated
and passed = by the Bakhshi, and in the case of a field army
the payment also was made lhrouch hig department At the ond
of Aurangzib’s reign, owing lo the yreal expansion of the
empire, there were one Chief Balshshi (called the First Bakhshi)
and three assistants, called the @nd, Sra and 4th Bakhshis, Each
field army was placed under a general appointed for the
occasion. Though at several periods we find olliecrs invested
with the tile of spa salar or ‘chief of the army) it was
only a litle of honour and these officers cid net really
command the entire Mughal army, The Emperor alone was
the commander-in-chiet.

The Khan-i-saman or Iligh Steward was the head of the
Emperor's household clepartment; he controlled all the personal
servants of the Emperor, supervised his daily expenditure,
meals, stores, &c, and accompanied him during his journeys,
The State factories or farkhanafhis were managed and paid
by him.

The Emperor was theoretically the highest judge in the


--- Page 492 ---
JUSTICE AND RELIGION HOW ADMINISTERED 485

realm, and used to try cases personally every Wednesday.
But the court held by him was a tribunal of the highest appeal
rather than a court of first instance. The Qazi was the
chief judge in all criminal suits of the Muslims and most
civil cases, and tried them according to Muslim law, assisted
by a muftt, who stated the abstract law bearing on the case
after consul{ing Arabic books on jurisprudence, while the Oazi
pronounced the sentence. '
The imperial Qazi, called the Qasi-ul-guzat, always
accompanied the Emperor, and appointed and dismissed the
local qazis of the cities and large villages in every province.
(s-The Chief Sadr (called the Sadrmus-sadut) was judge and
supervisor of the encdowments.of land made by. the Emperor
and the princes for the support .of pious. men,’ scholars
and monks. “It was his duty to see that. such’. grants -were

bul no KBan-t-saman. Each sithafidar tried to play the
Emperor wilhin his own jurisciction. ‘

The provincial administralion was concentrated in its chict
town. At important centres or sub-civisions there were faudues
fo maintain order, punish rebels andl wronddoers, and — assist
in the collection of revenue when opposed, The villages were
neglected and, eilher contemptiously or through insulfieieney
of official staff, lef to live their own lives, often as small
self-governing units or “village communities.”

In the bis cities the fofwal or prefect ol police nol only
enforeed flaw and order, but had also te discharge many
tunctions of a modern munieipalily, control lhe markets (weights
and prices), and maintain the Quranie rules of moratily,

The Central Governuenl kept itself intormed of the
occurrences in all parls of the country by means of spies and
news-reporters, both public and secret These agents formed four
classes: waqal-navts, sawanthenigar, Khutta-navis (Gecrel letter.
writer), and Aarkacah (spy aud courier). They had lo send reports
at regular intervals. Every public offfiee had an open reporter
or carist allached fo if, All the reporls reached the Entperor
through the Postmaster-General (Darogha- Dokehanki,

In spile of the repeated! prohibitions of ihe Emperors, many
local officers (and even subahdars) used to exact illegal cesses
(called cbtrads) under an immense vaticty of heads and from
all classes of artisans, traders, fabourers, and people tn general,
A list of 67 such abwads is given with explanatory notes in
my Mugfial Administeation, ch. 4. A farther source of
oppression was the practice of some subahdars to seize thy
goods of merchants in transit, pay an inadequate price or no
price at all for them, and then gell these goods in the open
market for their own profit (what lhe English traders called
“the forcing of goods”) or appropriate the choice articles fo their
own use. Only a strong and vigilant imperor could slop it
