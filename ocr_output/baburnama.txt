THE MEMOIRS OF BABUR

SECTION III. HINDUSTAN

932 AH.—OCT. 18TH 1525 ro OCT. 87H 1526 AD.!

(a. Fifth expedition into Hindistan.)

(Wov. 17th) On Friday the 1st of the month of Safar at the
date 932, the Sun being in the Sign of the Archer, we set out
for Hindiistan, crossed the small rise of Yak-langa, and dis-
mounted in the meadow to the west of the water of Dih-i-ya‘qiib.?
‘Abdu’l-malik the armourer came into this camp; he had gone
seven or eight months earlier as my envoy to Sultan Sa‘id Khan
(in Kashghar), and now brought one of the Khan’s men, styled
Yangi Beg (new beg) Kikildash who conveyed letters, and

* Elph. MS. f. 2056; W.-i-B. I.O. 215 f. 1994 omits the year’s events on the
ground that Shaikh Zain has translated them; I.O. 217 f. 174; Mems. p. 290;
Kehr’s Codex p. 1084.

A considerable amount of reliable textual material for revising the Hindistan
section of the English translation of the Babur-nama is wanting through loss of pages
from the Elphinstone Codex ; in one instance no less than an equivalent of 36 folios
of the [laidarabad Codex are missing (f. 356 e¢ seg.), but to set against this loss there
is the valuable Aer contra that Kehr’s manuscript throughout the section becomes of
substantial value, losing its Persified character and approximating closely to‘the true
text of the Elphinstone and Haidarabad Codices. Collateral help in revision is given
by the works specified (zz loco p. 428) as serving to, fill the gap existing in Babur’s
narrative previous to 932 AH. and this notably by those described by Elliot and
Dowson. Of these last, special help in supplementary details is given for 932 AH. and
part of 933 AH. by Shaikh Zain [Khawa/fi]’s Tabagat-c-baburi, which is a highly
.rhetorical paraphrase of Babur’s narrative, requiring familiarity with ornate Persian
to understand. For all my references to it, I am indebted to my husband. It may
be mentioned as an interesting circumstance that the B. M. possesses in Or. 1999 a copy
of this work which was transcribed in 998 AH. by one of Khwand-amir’s grandsons
and, judging from its date, presumably for Abi’l-fazl’s use in the Abar-nama.

Like part of the Kabul section, the Hindistan one is in diary-form, but it is still
more heavily surcharged with matter entered at a date later than the diary. It departs
from the style of the preceding diary by an occasional lapse into courtly phrase and
by exchange of some Turki words for Arabic and Persian ones, doubtless found
current in Hind, e.g. fauj, dira, manzil, khail-khana.

? This is the Logar affluent of the Baran-water (Kabul-river). Masson describes
this haltingplace (iii, 174).

small presents, and verbal messages ' from the Khanims and the
Khan.?

(Nov. 18th to 21st) After staying two days in that camp for
the convenience of the army,3 we marched on, halted one night,4
and next dismounted at Badam-chashma. There we atea con-
fection (wa‘jin).

(Nov. 22nd) On: Wednesday (Safar 6th), when we had dis-
mounted at Barik-ab, the younger brethren of Nir Beg—he
himself remaining in Hindistan—brought gold ashrafis and
zankas 5 to the value of 20,000 shahrukhis, sent from the Lahor
revenues by Khwaja Husain. The greater part of these moneys
was despatched by Mulla Ahmad, one of the chief men of Balkh,
for the benefit of Balkh.®

(Nov. 24th) On Friday the 8th of the month (Safar), after
dismounting at Gandamak, I had a violent discharge;7 by
God’s mercy, it passed off easily.

* muhaggar saughat u bilak or tilak. A small verbal point arises about dz/a& (or
tilak). Bilak is said by Quatremére to mean a gift (N. et E. xiv, 119 n.) but here
muhaggar saughat expresses gift. Another meaning can be assigned to éz/ak here,
[one had also by ¢/zk, |] v¢z. that of word-of-mouth news or communication, sometimes
supplementing written communication, possibly secret instructions, possibly small
domestic details. In d/@k, a gift, the root may be di/, the act of knowing, in /7/ak
it is #/, the act of speaking [whence /#/, the tongue, and ¢i/ tutmah, to get news].
In the sentence noted, either word would suit for a verbal communication. Returning
to dilak as a gift, it may express the eance of English token, the maker-known of
friendship, affection and so-on. This differentiates 4i/a% from saughdat, used in its
frequent sense of ceremonial and diplomatic presents of value and importance.

? With Sa‘id at this time were two Khanims Sultaén-nigar and Daulat-sultan who
were Babur’s maternal-aunts. Erskine suggested Khib-nigar, but she had died in
907 AH. (f. 96).

3 Humiyiin’s non-arrival would be the main cause of delay. Apparently he should
have joined before the Kabul force left that town.

4 The halt would be at Bit-khak, the last station before the Adinapir road takes
to the hills.

5 Discussing the value of coins mentioned by Babur, Erskine says in his History of
/ndia (vol. i, Appendix E.) which was published in 1854 AD. that he had come to
think his estimates of the value of the coins was set too low in the Afemoirs (published
in 1826 Ap.). This sum of 20,000 shahrukhis he put at £1000, Cf. E. Thomas’
Pathan Kings of Dihli and Resources of the Mughal Empire.

© One of Masson’s interesting details seems to fit the next stage of Babur’s march
(iii, 179). It is that after leaving Bit-khak, the road passes what in the thirties of
the 19th Century, was locally known as Babur Padshah’s Stone-heap (cairn) and
believed piled in obedience to Babur’s order that each man in his army should drop
a stone on it in passing. No time for raising such a monument could be fitter than
that of the fifth expedition into Hindiistan when a climax of opportunity allowed
hope of success.

7 rezandalik. This Erskine translates, both here and on ff. 253, 254, by defluxion,
but de Courteille by rhwme de cerveau. Shaikh Zain supports de Courteille by
writing, not vezandalik, but nuzla, catarrh, De Courteille, in illustration of his

(Nov. 25¢h) On Saturday we dismounted in the Bagh-i-wafa.
We delayed there a few days, waiting for Humayin and the
army from that side.‘ More than once in this history the bounds
and extent, charm and delight of that garden have been described ;
it is most beautifully placed; who sees it with the buyer’s eye
will know the sort of place it is. During the short time we
were there, most people drank on drinking-days? and took
their morning; on non-drinking days there were parties for
mazun.

I wrote harsh letters to Humayin, lecturing him severely
because of his long delay beyond the time fixed for him to
join me.3

(Dec. 3rd) On Sunday the 17th of Safar, after the morning
had been taken, Humayin arrived. I spoke very severely to
him at once. Khwaja Kalan also arrived to-day, coming up
from Ghazni. We marched in the evening of that same Sunday,
and dismounted in a new garden between Sultanpur and Khwaja
Rustam.

(Dec. 6th) Marching on Wednesday (Safar 20th), we got on
a raft, and, drinking as we went reached Qish-gumbaz,‘ there
landed and joined the camp.

reading of the word, quotes Burnes’ account of an affection common in the Panj-ab
and there called zz/a, which is a running at the nostrils, that wastes the brain and
stamina of the body and ends fatally ( 7ravels 7x Bukhara ed. 1839, ii, 41).

* Tramontana, north of Hindi-kush.

2 Shaikh Zain says that the drinking days were Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday and
Wednesday. :

3 The Elph. Codex (f. 2080) contains the following note of Humiayiin’s about his
delay; it has been expunged from the text but is still fairly legible :—‘‘ The time
fixed was after ‘Ashiira (10th Muharram, a voluntary fast) ; although we arrived after
the next-following 10th (‘@shér, z.e. of Safar), the delay had been necessary. The
purpose of the letters (Babur’s) was to get information; (in reply) it was repre-
sented that the equipment of the army of Badakhshan caused delay. If this slave
(Humayin), trusting to his [father’s] kindness, caused further delay, he has been
sorry.”

Babur’s march from the Bagh-i-wafa was delayed about a month; Humayiin started
late from Badakhshan ; his force may have needed some stay in Kabul for completion
of equipment ; his personal share of blame for which he counted on his father’s
forgiveness, is likely to have been connected with his mother’s presence in Kabul.

Humiyin’s note is quoted in Turki by one MS. of the Persian text (B.M. W.-i-B.
16,623 f. 128); and from certain indications in Muhammad Shirdazz’s lithograph
(p. 163), appears to be in his archetype the Udaipir Codex; but it is not with all
MSS. of the Persian text e.g. not with I.O. 217 and 218. A portion of it is in Kehr’s
MS. (p. 1086).

(Dec. 7th) Starting off the camp at dawn, we ourselves went on
a raft, and there ate confection (maiz). Our encamping-ground
was always Qiriq-ariq, but not a sign or trace of the camp could
be seen when we got opposite it, nor any appearance of our
horses. Thought I, “Garm-chashma (Hot-spring) is close by ;
they may have dismounted there.” So saying, we went on from
Qiriq-ariq. By the time we reached Garm-chashma, the very
day was late;' we did not stop there, but going on in its
lateness (Aichisz), had the raft tied up somewhere, and slept
awhile.

(Dec. 8th) At day-break we landed at Yada-bir where, as the
day wore on, the army-folks began to come in. The camp must
have been at Qiriq-ariq, but out of our sight.

There were several verse-makers on the raft, such as Shaikh
Abi'l-wajd,? Shaikh Zain, Mulla ‘Ali-jan, Tardi Beg Khaksar
and others. In this company was quoted the following couplet
of Muhammad Salih :—3

(Persian) With thee, arch coquette, for a sweetheart, what can man do ?
With another than thou where thou art, what can man do ?
Said I, “Compose on these lines” ;4 whereupon those given to
versifying, did so. As jokes were always being made at the
expense of Mulla ‘Ali-jan, this couplet came off-hand into my
head :—

(Persian) With one all bewildered as thou, what can man do?
5 P » what can man do?s

* gin khiid kich balub aidi ; a little joke perhaps at the lateness both of the day
and the army.

2 Shaikh Zain’s maternal-uncle.

3 Shaikh Zain’s useful detail that this man’s pen-name was Sharaf distinguishes
him from Muhammad Salih the author of the Shazbani-nama.

4+ gosha, angle (of. gosha-t-kar, limits of work). Parodies were to be made, having
the same metre, rhyme, and refrain as the model couplet.

5 I am unable to attach sense to Babur’s second line; what is wanted is an illustra-
tion of two incompatible things. Babur’s reflections [7#fra] condemned his verse.
Shaikh Zain describes the whole episode of the verse-making on the raft, and goes
on with, ‘He (Babur) excised this choice couplet from the pages of his Acts
( }Vaq7 ‘at) with the knife of censure, and scratched it out from the tablets of his noble
heart with the finger-nails of repentance. I shall now give an account of this spiritual
matter” (z.¢. the repentance), ‘‘ by presenting the recantations of his Solomon-like
Majesty in his very own words, which are weightier than any from the lips of
Aesop.” Shaikh Zain next quotes the Turki passage here translated in 5. Mention
of the Afubin.

(6. Mention of the Mubin.) a

From time to time before it,? whatever came into my head,
of good or bad, grave or jest, used to be strung into verse and
written down, however empty and harsh the verse might be, but
while I was composing the J/udin, this thought pierced through
my dull wits and made way into my troubled heart, “A pity it
will be if the tongue which has treasure of utterances so lofty as
these are, waste itself again on low words ; sad will it be if again
vile imaginings find way into the mind that has made exposition
of these sublime realities.’3 Since that time I had refrained
from satirical and jesting verse; I was repentant (¢a’zd); but these
matters were totally out of mind and remembrance when I made
that couplet (on Mulla ‘Ali-jan).4 A few days later in Bigram
when IJ had fever and discharge, followed by cough, and I began
to spit blood each time I coughed, I knew whence my reproof
came; I knew what act of mine had brought this affliction on me.

“Whoever shall violate his oath, will violate it to the hurt
of his own soul ; but whoever shall perform that which he hath
covenanted with God, to that man surely will He give great
reward ” (Qoran cap. 48 v. 10).

(Turki) What is it I do with thee, ah ! my tongue ?
My entrails bleed as a reckoning for thee.
Good once 5 as thy words were, has followed this verse
Jesting, empty,° obscene, has followed a lie.
If thou say, ‘‘Burn will I not !” by keeping this vow
Thou turnest thy rein from this field of strife.”

——)

* The A/uébin (g.v. Index) is mentioned again and quoted on f. 3514. In both
places its name escaped the notice of Erskine and de Courteille, who here took it for
min, I, and on f. 3516 omitted it, matters of which the obvious cause is that both
translators were less familiar with the poem than it is now easy to be. There is
amplest textual warrant for reading AZ«éiz in both the places indicated above; its
reinstatement gives to the English and French translations what they have needed,
namely, the clinch of a definite stimulus and date of repentance, which was the
influence of the Mubin in 928 AH. (1521-2 AD.). The whole passage about the
peccant verse and its fruit of contrition should be read with others that express the same
regret for broken law and may all have been added to the diary at the same time,
probably in 935 AH. (1529 AD.). They will be found grouped in the Index s.7. Babur.

2 miindin birin, by which J understand, as the grammatical construction will
warrant, before writing the Afubin. To read the words as referring to the peccant
verse, is to take the clinch off the whole passage.

3 z.e. of the Qoranz on which the Afudin is based.

4 Dropping down-stream, with wine and good company, he entirely forgot his good
resolutions.

5 This appears to refer to the good thoughts embodied in the A/din.

© This appears to contrast with the ‘‘sublime realities” of the Qorav.

7 In view of the interest of the passage, and because this verse is not in the Rampir
Diwan, as are many contained in the Hindiistan section, the Turki original is

“O Lord! we have dealt unjustly with our own souls; if
Thou forgive us not, and be not merciful unto us, we shall surely
be of those that perish” (Qorau cap. 7 v. 22).

Taking anew the place of the penitent pleading for pardon,
I gave my mind rest? from such empty thinking and such
unlawful occupation. I broke my pen. Made by that Court,
such reproof of sinful slaves is for their felicity; happy are the
highest and the slave when such reproof brings warning and its
profitable fruit.

(c. Narrative resumed.)

(Dec. 8th continued) Marching on that evening, we dismounted
at ‘Ali-masjid. The ground here being very confined, I always
used to dismount on a rise overlooking the camp in the valley-
bottom.3 The camp-fires made a wonderful illumination there
at night ; assuredly it was because of this that there had always
been drinking there, and was so now.

(Dec. 9th and toth) To-day I rode out before dawn ; I preferred
a confection (sa‘jiiz)4 and also kept this day a fast. We
dismounted near Bigram (Peshawar); and next morning, the
camp remaining on that same ground, rode to Karg-awi.5 We
crossed the Siyah-ab in front of Bigram, and formed our hunting-
circle looking down-stream. After a little, a person brought

quoted. My translation differs from those of Mr. Erskine and M. de Courteille ; all
three are tentative of a somewhat difficult verse.

3 Of ‘Ali-masjid the Second Afghan War (official account) has a picture which
might be taken from Babur’s camp.

4 Shaikh Zain’s list of the drinking-days (f. 252 note) explains why sometimes
Babur says he preferred ma‘7iin. In the instances I have noticed, he does this
on a drinking-day; the preference will be therefore for a confection over wine.
December 9th was a Saturday and drinking-day; on it he mentions the preference ;
Tuesday Noy. 21st was a drinking day, and he states that he ate ma‘7az.

5 presumably the £arg-khana of f. 2224, rhinoceros-home in both places. A similar
name applies to a tract in the Rawalpindi District, —Babur-khana, Tiger-home, which
is linked to the tradition of Buddha’s self-sacrifice to appease the hunger of seven
tiger-cubs. [In this Babur-khana is the town Kacha-kot from which Babur always
names the river Hari.]

word that there was a rhino in a bit of jungle near Bigram, and
that people had been stationed near-about it. We betook our-
selves, loose rein, to the place, formed a ring round the jungle,
made a noise, and brought the rhino out, when it took its way
across the plain. Huméayiin and those come with him from that
side (Tramontana), who had never seen one before, were much
entertained. It was pursued for two miles; many arrows were
shot at it; it was brought down without having made a good
set at man or horse. Two others were killed. I had often
wondered how a rhino and an elephant would behave if brought
face to face; this time one came out right in front of some
elephants the mahauts were bringing along ; it did not face them
when the mahauts drove them towards it, but got off in another
direction.

(da. Preparations for ferrying the Indus.*)

On the day we were in Bigram, several of the begs and
household were appointed, with pay-masters and diwans, six or
seven being put in command, to take charge of the boats at the
Nil-ab crossing, to make a list of all who were with the army,
name by name, and to count them up.

That evening I had fever and discharge? which led on to
cough and every time I coughed, I spat blood. Anxiety was
great but, by God’s mercy, it passed off in two or three days.

(Dec. rrth) It rained when we left Bigram ; we dismounted
on the Kabul-water.

(e. News from Léhor.)

News came that Daulat Khan3 and (Apaq) Ghazi Khan,
having collected an army of from 20 to 30,000, had taken
Kilaniir, and intended to move on Lahor. At once Mumin-i-‘ali
the commissary was sent galloping off to say, “ We are advancing
march by march ;4 do not fight till we arrive.”

* This is the first time on an outward march that Babur has crossed the Indus by
boat; hitherto he has used the ford above Attock, once however specifying that men
on a were put over on rafts.

2 ae

3 In my Translator’s Note (p. 428), attention was drawn to the circumstance that
Babur always writes Daulat Khan Vésuf-khaz/, and not Daulat Khan Ladi. In doing
this, he uses the family- or clan-name instead of the tribal one, Lidi.

(Dec. 14th) With two night-halts on the way, we reached the

water of Sind (Indus), and there dismounted on Thursday the
28th (of Safar).

(f. Ferrying the Indus.)

(Dec. 16th) On Saturday the ist of the first Rabi’, we crossed
the Sind-water, crossed the water of Kacha-kot (Hari), and
dismounted on the bank of the river.’ The begs, pay-masters
and diwans who had been put in charge of the boats, reported
that the number of those come with the army, great and small,
good and bad, retainer and non-retainer, was written down as
12,000.

(g. The eastward march.)

The rainfall had been somewhat scant in the plains, but
seemed to have been good in the cultivated lands along the
hill-skirts ; for these reasons we took the road for Sialkot along
the skirt-hills. Opposite Hati Kakar’s country ? we came upon
a torrent 3 the waters of which were standing in pools. Those
pools were all frozen over. The ice was not very thick, as thick
as the hand may-be. Such ice is unusual in Hindiistan ; not
a sign or trace of any was seen in the years we were (azdik) in
the country.4

We had made five marches from the Sind-water; after the
sixth (Dec. 22nd—Rabi‘ I. 7th) we dismounted on a torrent
in the camping-ground (yz#r¢) of the Bugials5 below Balnath
Jogi's hill which connects with the Hill of Jad.

: daryd, which Babur’s precise use of words e.g. of darya, rid, and si, allows to
apply here to the Indus only.

2 Presumably this was near Parhala, which stands, where the Sihan river quits the
hills, at the eastern entrance of a wild and rocky gorge a mile in length. It will have
been P this gorge that Babur approached Parhila in 925 AH. (Rawalpindi Gazetteer
p. 11).

3 7,e. here, bed of a mountain-stream.

4 The Elphinstone Codex here preserves the following note, the authorship of
which is attested by the scribe’s remark that it is copied from the handwriting of
Humfayin Padshah :—As my honoured father writes, we did not know until we
occupied Hindistan (932 AH.), but afterwards did know, that ice does form here and
there if there come a colder year. This was markedly so in the year I conquered
Gujrat (942 AH.-1535 AD.) when it was so cold for two or three days between
Bhilpiir and Gualiar that the waters were frozen over a hand’s thickness.

5 This is a Kakar (Gakkhar) clan, known also as Baragowah, of which the location
in Jahangir Padshah’s time was from Rohtas to Hatya, ze. about where Babur
encamped (Afemotrs of Jahangir, Rogers and Beveridge, p. 97; E. and D. vi, 309 ;
Provincial Gazetteers of Rawalpindi and Jihlam, p. 64 and p. 97 respectively).

932 AH.—OCT. 18TH 1525 ro OCT. 8rH 1526 AD. 453

(Dec. 23rd) In order to let people get provisions, we stayed
the next day in that camp. ‘Avag was drunk on that day.
Mulla Muh. Parghari told many stories ; never had he been so
talkative. Mulla Shams himself was very riotous; once he
began, he did not finish till night.

The slaves and servants, good and bad, who had gone out
after provisions, went further than this * and heedlessly scattered
over jungle and plain, hill and broken ground. Owing to this,
a few were overcome ; Kichkina ¢déngztar died there.

(Dec. 24th) Marching on, we crossed the Bihat-water at a ford
below Jilam (Jihlam) and there dismounted. Wali Qizé/ (Rufus)
came there to see me. He was the Sialkot reserve, and held
the parganas of Bimriki and Akriada. Thinking about Sialkot,
I took towards him the position of censure and reproach. He
excused himself, saying “I had come to my fargana before
Khusrau Kikildash left Sialkot; he did not even send me
word.” After listening to his excuse, I said, “ Since thou hast
paid no attention to Sialkot, why didst thou not join the begs
in Lahor?” He was convicted, but as work was at hand, I did
not trouble about his fault.

(h. Scouts sent with orders to Léhor.)

(Dec. 25th) Sayyid Tifan and Sayyid Lachin were sent
galloping off, each with a pair-horse,? to say in Lahor, “Do
not join battle; meet us at Sialkot or Parsrir” (mod. Pasriir).
It was in everyone’s mouth that Ghazi Khan had collected 30
to 40,060 men, that Daulat Khan, old as he was, had girt two
swords to his waist, and that they were resolved to fight.
Thought I, “The proverb says that ten friends are better than
nine; do you not make a mistake: when the Lahor begs have
joined you, fight there and then!”

(Dec. 26th and 27th) After starting off the two men to the
begs, we moved forward, halted one night, and next dismounted
on the bank of the Chin-ab (Chan-ab).

As Buhlilptr was £halsa,’ we left the road to visit it. Its
fort is situated above a deep ravine, on the bank of the Chin-ab.
It pleased us much. We thought of bringing Sialkot to it.
Please God! the chance coming, it shall be done straightway !
From Buhlilpir we went to camp by boat.

(2. Jats and Gujiirs.)

(Dec. 29th) On Friday the 14th of the first Rabi‘ we dis-
mounted at Sialkot. If one go into Hindustan the Jats and
Gujirs always pour down in countless hordes from hill and plain
for loot in bullock and buffalo. These ill-omened peoples are
just senseless oppressors! Formerly their doings did not concern
us much because the country was an enemy’s, but they began
the same senseless work after we had taken it. When we
reached Sialkot, they fell in tumult on poor and needy folks who
were coming out of the town to our camp, and stripped them
bare. I had the silly thieves sought for, and ordered two or
three of them cut to pieces.

From Sialkot Nir Beg’s brother Shaham also was made to
gallop off to the begs in Lahor to say, “Make sure where the
enemy is; find out from some well-informed person where he
may be met, and send us word.”

A trader, coming into this camp, represented that ‘Alam Khan
had let Sl. Ibrahim defeat him.

t According to Shaikh Zain it was in this year that Babur made Buhlilpiir a royal
domain (B.M. Add. 26,202 f. 16), but this does not agree with Babur’s explanation
that he visited the place because it was alsa. Its name suggests that it had belonged
to Buhlal Zaz; Babur may have taken it in 930 AH. when he captured Sialkot. It
never received the population of Sialkot, as Babur had planned it should do because
pond-water was drunk in the latter town and was a source of disease. The words in
which Babur describes its situation are those he uses of Akhsi (f. 46); not improbably
a resemblance inclined his liking towards Buhlilpiir. (It may be noted that this
Buhlilpiir is mentioned in the Ayin-z-akbari and marked on large maps, but is not
found in the G. of I. 1907.)

? Both names are thus spelled in the Babur-ndma. In view of the inclination of
Turki to long vowels, Babur’s short one in Jat may be worth consideration since
modern usage of Jat and Jat varies. Mr. Crooke writes the full vowel, and mentions
that Jats are Hindis, Sikhs, and Muhammadans (77zbes and Castes of the North-
western Provinces and Oude, iii, 38). On this point and on the orthography of the
name, Erskine’s note (A/emotrs p. 294) is as follows: ‘‘ The Jets or Jats are the
Muhammadan peasantry of the Panj-ab, the bank of the Indus, Siwistan e¢c. and
must not be confounded with the Jats, a powerful Hindi tribe to the west of the
Jamna, about Agra e¢c. and which occupies a subordinate position in the country of
the Rajpiits.”

(7. ‘Alam Khan's action and failure.)

Here are the particulars :—‘Alam Khan, after taking leave of
me (in Kabul, 931AH.), went off in that heat by double marches,
regardless of those with him.? As at the time I gave him leave
to go, all the Atizbeg khans and sultans had laid siege to Balkh,
I rode for Balkh as soon as I had given him his leave. On his
reaching Liahor, he insisted to the begs, “ You reinforce me ; the
Padshah said so; march along with me; let us get (Apaq)
Ghazi Khan to join us; let us move on Dihli and Agra.” Said
they, “ Trusting to what, will you join Ghazi Khan? Moreover
the royal orders to us were, ‘If at any time Ghazi Khan has
sent his younger brother Haji Khan with his son to Court, join
him ; or do so, if he has sent them, by way of pledge, to Lahor ;
if he has done neither, do not join him.’ You yourself only
yesterday fought him and let him beat you! Trusting to what,
will you join him now? Besides all this, it is not for your
advantage to join him!” Having said what-not of this sort,
they refused ‘Alam Khan. He did not fall in with their views,
but sent his son Sher Khan to speak with Daulat Khan and
with Ghazi Khan, and afterwards all saw one another.

‘Alam Khan took with him Dilawar Khan, who had come
into Lahor two or three months earlier after his escape from
prison ; he took also Mahmiid Khan (son of) Khan-i-jahan,3 to

* The following section contains a later addition to the diary summarizing the
action of ‘Alam Khan before and after Babur heard of the defeat from the trader he
mentions. It refutes an opinion found here and there in European writings that
Babur used and threw over ‘Alam Khan. It and Babur’s further narrative shew that
“Alam Khan had little valid backing in Hindiistan, that he contributed nothing to
Babur’s success, and that no abstention by Babur from attack on Ibrahim would have
set ‘Alam Khan on the throne of Dihli. It and other records, Babur’s and those of
Afghan chroniclers, allow it to be said that if ‘Alam Khan had been strong enough to
accomplish his share of the compact that he should take and should rule Dihli, Babur
would have kept to his share, namely, would have maintained supremacy in the
Panj-ab. He advanced against Ibrahim only when ‘Alam Khan had totally failed in
arms and in securing adherence.

? This objurgation on over-rapid marching looks like the echo of complaint made
to Babur by men of his own whom he had given to ‘Alam Khan in Kabul.

3 Mahmid himself may have inherited his father’s title Khan-i-jahan but a little
further on he is specifically mentioned as the son of Khan-i-jahan, presumably because
his father had been a more notable man than he was. Of his tribe it may be noted
that the Iaidarabad MS. uniformly writes Nuhani and not Luhani as is usual in
European writings, and that it does so even when, as on f. 1494, the word is applied
to a trader. Concerning the tribe, family, or caste vde G. of I. s.2. Lohanas and

whom a fargana in the Lahor district had been given. They
seem to have left matters at this:—Daulat Khan with Ghazi
Khan was to take all the begs posted in Hindiistan to himself,
indeed he was to take everything on that side ;* while ‘Alam
Khan was to take Dilawar Khan and Haji Khan and, reinforced
by them, was to capture Dihli and Agra. Isma‘il /é/wani and
other amirs came and saw ‘Alam Khan; all then betook
themselves, march by march, straight for Dihli. Near Indri
came also Sulaiman Shaikh-zada.2_ Their total touched 30 to
40,000 men.

They laid siege to Dihli but could neither take it by assault
nor do hurt to the garrison.3 When Sl]. Ibrahim heard of their
assembly, he got an army to horse against them ; when they
heard of his approach, they rose from before the place and
moved to meet him. They had left matters at this :—“If we
attack by day-light, the Afghans will not desert (to us), for the
sake of their reputations with one another ; but if we attack at
night when one man cannot see another, each man will obey
his own orders.” Twice over they started at fall of day from
a distance of 12 miles (6 kuvohs), and, unable to bring matters
toa point, neither advanced nor retired, but just sat on horseback
for two or three watches. On a third occasion they delivered
an attack when one watch of night remained—their purpose
seeming to be the burning of tents and huts! They went ; they
set fire from every end ; they made a disturbance. Jalal Khan
Jig-hat* came with other amirs and saw ‘Alam Khan.

Sl. Ibrahim did not bestir himself till shoot of dawn from
where he was with a few of his own family5 within his own
enclosure (sardcha). Meantime ‘Alam Khan’s people were busy
with plunder and booty. Seeing the smallness of their number,
Sl. Ibrahim’s people moved out against them in rather small

force with one elephant. ‘Alam Khan’s party, not able to make
stand against the elephant, ran away. He in his flight crossed
over into the Mian-dt-ab and crossed back again when he
reached the Panipat neighbourhood. In Indri he contrived on
some pretext to get 4 Jaks from Mian Sulaiman.1 He was
deserted by Isma‘il /z/wanz, by Biban? and by his own oldest
son Jalal, who all withdrew into the Mian-di-ab; and he had
been deserted just before the fighting, by part of his troops,
namely, by Darya Khan (Vihani)’s son Saif Khan, by Khan-i-
jahan (V#hani)’s son Mahmid Khan, and by Shaikh Jamal
Farmuli. When he was passing through Sihrind with Dilawar
Khan, he heard of our advance and of our capture of Milwat
(Malot).3 On this Dilawar Khan—who always had been my
well-wisher and on my account had dragged out three or four
months in prison,—left ‘Alam Khan and the rest and went to
his family in Sultanpir. He waited on me three or four days
after we took Milwat. ‘Alam Khan and Haji Khan crossed
the Shatlut (s¢c)-water and went into Gingiita,4 one of the strong-
holds in the range that lies between the valley and the plain.5
There our Afghan and Hazara® troops besieged them, and had
almost taken that strong fort when night came on. Those
inside were thinking of escape but could not get out because of
the press of horses in the Gate. There must have been elephants
also ; when these were urged forward, they trod down and killed
many horses. ‘Alam Khan, unable to escape mounted, got out
on foot in the darkness. After a /ak of difficulties, he joined
Ghazi Khan, who had not gone into Milwat but had fled into the

hills. Not being received with even a little friendliness by
Ghazi Khan; needs must! he came and waited on me at the
foot of the dale? near Pehlir.

(2. Diary resumed.)

A person came to Sialkot from the Lahor begs to say they
would arrive early next morning to wait on me.

(Dec. 30th) Marching early next day (Rabi‘ I. 15th), we
dismounted at Parsrir. There Muh. ‘Ali /ang-jang, Khwaja
Husain and several braves waited on me. As the enemy’s camp
seemed to be on the Lahor side of the Ravi, we sent men out
under Bijka for news. Near the third watch of the night they
brought word that the enemy, on hearing of us, had fled, no man
looking to another.

(Dec. 31s¢) Getting early to horse and leaving baggage and
train in the charge of Shah Mir Husain and Jan Beg, we
bestirred ourselves. We reached Kalanir in the afternoon, and
there dismounted. Muhammad Sl. Mirza and ‘Adil S1.? came
to wait on me there, together with some of the begs.

(Jan. 1st 1526 AD.) We marched early from Kalanir. On
the road people gave us almost certain news of Ghazi Khan and
other fugitives. Accordingly we sent, flying after those fliers,
the commanders Muhammadi, Ahmadi, Qitliiq-qadam, Treasurer
Wali and most of those begs who, in Kabul, had recently bent
the knee for their begship. So far it was settled :—That it
would be good indeed if they could overtake and capture the
fugitives ; and that, if they were not able to do this, they were
to keep careful watch round Milwat (Malot), so as to prevent
those inside from getting out and away. Ghazi Khan was the
object of this watch.

(2. Capture of Milwat.)

(Jan. 2nd and 3rd) After starting those begs ahead, we
crossed the Biah-water (Beas) opposite Kanwahin3 and dis-
mounted. From there we marched to the foot of the valley of
Fort Milwat, making two night-halts on the way. The begs who

had arrived before us, and also those of Hindiistan were ordered
to dismount in such a way as to besiege the place closely.

A grandson of Daulat Khan, son of his eldest son ‘Ali Khan,
Isma‘il Khan by name, came out of Milwat to see me; he took
back promise mingled with threat, kindness with menace.

(Jan. 5th) On Friday (Rabi‘ I. 21st) I moved camp forward
to within a mile of the fort, went myself to examine the place,
posted right, left and centre, then returned to camp.

Daulat Khan sent to represent to me that Ghazi Khan had
fled into the hills, and that, if his own faults were pardoned, he
would take service with me and surrender Milwat. Khwaja
Mir-i-miran was sent to chase fear from his heart and to escort
him out ; he came, and with him his son ‘Ali Khan. I had
ordered that the two swords he had girt to his waist to fight
me with, should be hung from his neck. Was such a rustic
blockhead possible! With things as they were, he still made
pretensions! When he was brought a little forward, I ordered
the swords to be removed from his neck. At the time of our
seeing one another’ he hesitated to kneel; I ordered them to
pull his leg and make him do so. I had him seated quite in
front, and ordered a person well acquainted with Hindistani to
interpret my words to him, one after another. Said I, “Thus
speak :—I called thee Father. I shewed thee more honour and
respect than thou couldst have asked. Thee and thy sons
I saved from door-to-door life amongst the Baliichis.2 Thy
family and thy aram 1 freed from Ibrahim’s prison-house.3
Three krovs 1 gave thee on Tatar Khan’s lands.4 What ill

that in 814 AH. (1411 AD.), Khizr Khan who is allowed by the date to have been
a Sayyid ruler in Dihli, sent an embassy to Shahrukh Mirza the then Timirid ruler
of Samarkand to acknowledge his suzerainty (A/azla‘u’s-sa‘dain, Quatremére, N. et
Ex. xiv, 196).

stuttered a few words, but he gave no answer, nor indeed could
answer be given to words so silencing. He was ordered to
remain with Khwaja Mir-i-miran.

(Jan. 6th) On Saturday the 22nd of the first Rabi‘, I went
myself to safeguard the exit of the families and arams* from
the fort, dismounting on a rise opposite the Gate. To me there
came ‘Ali Khan and made offering of a few ashrafts. People
began to bring out the families just before the Other Prayer.
Though Ghazi Khan was reported to have got away, there were
who said they had seen him in the fort. For this reason several
of the household and braves? were posted at the Gate, in order
to prevent his escape by a ruse, for to get away was his full
intention. Moreover if jewels and other valuables were being
taken away by stealth, they were to be confiscated. I spent
that night in a tent pitched on the rise in front of the Gate.

(Jan. 7th) Early next morning, Muhammadi, Ahmadi, Sl.
Junaid, ‘Abdu’l-‘aziz, Muhammad ‘Ali Jang-jang and Qitliiq-
qadam were ordered to enter the fort and take possession of all
effects. As there was much disturbance at the Gate, I shot off
a few arrows by way of chastisement. Humayiin’s story-teller
(gissa-khwan) was struck by the arrow of his destiny and at
once surrendered his life.

Jan. 7th and 8th) After spending two nights4 on the rise,
I inspected the fort. I went into Ghazi Khan’s book-room ;5
some of the precious things found in it, I gave to Humayin,
some sent to Kamran (in Qandahar). There were many books
of learned contents,° but not so many valuable ones as had at
first appeared. I passed that night in the fort ; next morning
I went back to camp.

(Jan. 9th) It had been in our minds that Ghazi Khan was in
the fort, but he, a man devoid of nice sense of honour, had

(Jan. roth) Leaving that camp on Wednesday, we moved
towards the hills to which Ghazi Khan had fled. When we
dismounted in the valley-bottom two miles from the camp in
the mouth of Milwat,! Dilawar Khan came and waited on me.
Daulat Khan, ‘Ali Khan and Isma‘l Khan, with other chiefs,
were given into Kitta Beg’s charge who was to convey them to
the Bhira fort of Milwat (Malot),? and there keep guard over
them. In agreement with Dilawar Khan, blood-ransom was
fixed for some who had been made over each to one man ; some
gave security, some were kept prisoner. Daulat Khan died
when Kitta Beg reached Sultanpir with the prisoners.3

Milwat was given into the charge of Muh. ‘Ali /ang-jang who,
pledging his own life for it, left his elder brother Arghiin and
a party of braves in it. A body of from 200 to 250 Afghans
were told off to reinforce him.

Khwaja Kalan had loaded several camels with Ghazni wines.
A party was held in his quarters overlooking the fort and the
whole camp, some drinking ‘arag, some wine. It was a varied

party.

the Afghan families from Milwat also; Dilawar Khan’s own seems to have been there
already (f. 257).

The Babur-nadma makes no mention of Daulat Khin’s relations with Nanak,
the founder of the Sikh religion, nor does it mention Nanak himself. A tradition
exists that Nanak, when on his travels, made exposition of his doctrines to an
attentive Babur and that he was partly instrumental in bringing Babur against the
Afghans. He was 12 years older than Babur and survived him nine. (Cf. Dadbistaz

are understood to call a dale (judga).! In this dale is a running-
water? of Hindistan ; along its sides are many villages ; and it
is said to be the pargana of the Jaswal, that is to say, of
Dilawar Khan’s maternal uncles. It lies there shut-in, with
meadows along its torrent, rice cultivated here and there, a three
or four mill-stream flowing in its trough, its width from two to
four miles, six even in places, villages on the skirts of its hills—
hillocks they are rather—where there are no villages, peacocks,
monkeys, and many fowls which, except that they are mostly of
one colour, are exactly like house-fowls.

As no reliable news was had of Ghazi Khan, we arranged for
Tardika to go with Birim Deo dValinhas and capture him
wherever he might be found.

In the hills of this dale stand thoroughly strong forts ; one on
the north-east, named Kitila, has sides 70 to 80 yards (gari)
of straight fall, the side where the great gate is being perhaps
7 or 8 yards.3 The width of the place where the draw-bridge
is made, may be 10 to 12 yards. Across this they have made
a bridge of two tall trees+ by which horses and herds are taken
over. This was one of the local forts Ghazi Khan had
strengthened ; his man will have been in it now. Our raiders
(chapginchz) assaulted it and had almost taken it when night
came on. The garrison abandoned this difficult place and went
off. Near this dale is also the stronghold of Ginguta ; it is girt

2 bir dgar-sit. Babur’s earlier uses of this term [g.v. index] connect it with the
swift flow of water in irrigation channels ; this may be so here but also the term may
make distinction between the rapid mountain-stream and the slow movement of rivers
across plains.

3 There are two readings of this sentence ; Erskine’s implies that the neck of land
connecting the fort-rock with its adjacent hill measures 7-8 gart (yards) from side to
side ; de Courteille’s that where the great gate was, the perpendicular fall surrounding
the fort shallowed to 7-8 yards. The Turki might be read, I think, to mean which-
ever alternative was the fact. Erskine’s reading best bears out Babur’s account of
the strength of the fort, since it allows of a cleft between the hill and the fort some
140-160 feet deep, as against the 21-24 of de Courteille’s. Erskine may have been in
possession of information [in 1826] by which he guided his translation (p. 300), ‘* At
its chief gate, for the space of 7 or 8 gez (gari), there is a place that admits of a draw-
bridge being thrown across ; it may be 10 or 12 gez wide.” If de Courteille’s reading
be correct in taking 7-8 gaz only to be the depth of the cleft, that cleft may be
artificial.

After despatching the light troop against Ghazi Khan, I put
my foot in the stirrup of resolution, set my hand on the rein of
trust in God, and moved forward against Sultan Ibrahim, son of
Sultan Sikandar, son of Buhlil Ladz Afghan, in possession of
whose throne at that time were the Dihli capital and the
dominions of Hindistan, whose standing-army was called a lak

about 1000.

3 Babur’s persistent interest in Balkh attracts attention, especially at this time so
shortly before he does not include it as part of his own territories (f. 270).

Since I wrote of Balkh s.a. 923 AH. (1517 AD.), I have obtained the following
particulars about it in that year; they are summarized from the Wadibu’s-szyar (lith.
ed. iii, 371). In 923 AH. Khwand-amir was in retirement at Pasht in Ghirjistan where
also was Muhammad-i-zaman Mirza. The two went in company to Balkh where the
Mirza besieged Babur’s man Ibrahim chapik (Slash-face), and treacherously murdered
one Airdii-shah, an envoy sent out to parley with him. Information of what was
happening was sent to Babur in Kabul. Babur reached Balkh when it had been
besieged a month. His presence caused the Mirza to retire and led him to go into
the Dara-i-gaz (Tamarind-valley). Babur, placing in Balkh Faqir-i-‘ali, one of those
just come up with him, followed the Mirza but turned back at Aq-gumbaz (White-
dome) which lies between Chach-charan in the Heri-riid valley and the Ghirjistan
border, going no further because the Ghirjistanis favoured the Mirza. Babur went
back to Kabul by the Firiiz-koh, Yaka-aiilang (cf. f. 195) and Ghir; the Mirza was
followed up by others, captured and conveyed to Kabul.

The light troop we had sent out from Milwat (Malot), took
Hurtr, Kahlir and all the hill-forts of the neighbourhood—
places to which because of their strength, no-one seemed to have
gone for a long time—and came back to me after plundering
a little. Came also ‘Alam Khan, on foot, ruined, stripped bare.
We sent some of the begs to give him honourable meeting,
sent horses too, and he waited (salazamat gildi) in that
neighbourhood.*

Raiders of ours went into the hills and valleys round-about,
but after a few nights’ absence, came back without anything to
count. Shah Mir Husain, Jan Beg and a few of the braves
asked leave and went off for a raid.

While we were in the (Jaswan) din, dutiful letters had come
more than once from Isma‘il /z/zvanz and Biban ; we replied to
them from this place by royal letters such as their hearts
desired. After we got out of the dale to Rupar, it rained very
much and became so cold that a mass of starved and naked
Hindistanis died.

When we had left Riipar and were dismounted at Karal,?
opposite Sihrind, a Hindiistani coming said, “I am Sl. Ibrahim’s
envoy,” and though he had no letter’or credentials, asked for an
envoy from us. We responded at once by sending one or two
Sawadi night-guards (¢uzgztar).3 These humble persons Ibrahim
put in prison ; they made their escape and came back to us on
the very day we beat him.

After having halted one night on the way, we dismounted on

his visit to the upper course of the Ghaggar is somewhat difficult to translate.

apart, one running water there is in Hindistan, is this’; they
call it the water of Kakar (Ghaggar). Chitr also is on its bank.
We rode up it for an excursion. The rising-place (222) of the
water of this torrent (vd) is 3 or 4 kurohs (6-8 m.) above Chitr.
Going up the (Kakar) torrent, we came to where a 4 or 5 mill-
stream issues from a broad (side-)valley (dara), up which there
are very pleasant places, healthy and convenient. I ordered
a Char-bagh to be made at the mouth of the broad valley of
this (tributary) water, which falls into the (Kakar-) torrent after
flowing for one or two kuvohs through level ground. From its
infall to the springs of the Kakar the distance may be
3 to 4 kurohs (6-8 m.). When it comes down in flood during the
rains and joins the Kakar, they go together to Samana and
Sanam.?

In this camp we heard that SI. Ibrahim had been on our side
of Dihli and had moved on from that station, also that Hamid
Khan hasa-khail3 the military-collector (shk¢gdar) of Hisar-
firtiza, had left that place with its army and with the army of its
neighbourhood, and had advanced 10 or 15 kuvohs (20-30 m.).
Kitta Beg was sent for news to Ibrahim’s camp, and Mumin
Ataka to the Hisar-firiiza camp.

(q. Humayiin moves against Hamid Khan.)

(Feb. 25th) Marching from Ambala, we dismounted by the
side of a lake. There Mumin Ataka and Kitta Beg rejoined
us, both on the same day, Sunday the 13th of the first Jumada.

We appointed Humayin to act against Hamid Khan, and
joined the whole of the right (wing) to him, that is to say,
Khwaja Kalan, Sl. Muhammad Dé/dai, Treasurer Wali, and
also some of the begs whose posts were in Hindistan, namely,
Khusrau, Hindi Beg, ‘Abdu’l-‘aziz and Muhammad ‘Ali /ang-
Jang, with also, from the household and braves of the centre,
Shah Manstir Bar/as, Kitta Beg and Muhibb-i ‘ali.

Biban waited on me in this camp. These Afghans remain
very rustic and tactless! This person asked to sit although
Dilawar Khan, his superior in following and in rank, did not sit,
and although the sons of ‘Alam Khan, who are of royal birth,
did not sit. Little ear was lent to his unreason !

(Feb. 26th) At dawn on Monday the 14th Humayiin moved
out against Hamid Khan. After advancing for some distance,
he sent between 100 and 150 braves scouting ahead, who went
close up to the enemy and at once got to grips. But when
after. a few encounters, the dark mass of Humayin’s troops
shewed in the rear, the enemy ran right away. Humayiin’s men
unhorsed from 100 to 200, struck the heads off one half and
brought the other half in, together with 7 or 8 elephants.

(March 2nd) On Friday the 18th of the month, Beg Mirak
Mughil brought news of Humayiin’s victory to the camp. He
(Humayin ?) was there and then given a special head-to-foot
and a special horse from the royal stable, besides promise of
guerdon (jzuldit).

(March 5th) On Monday the 25th of the month, Humayiin
arrived to wait on me, bringing with him as many as 100
prisoners and 7 or 8 elephants. Ustad ‘Ali-quli and the
matchlockmen were ordered to shoot all the prisoners, by way
of example. This had been Huméayiin’s first affair, his first
experience of battle ; it was an excellent omen!

Our men who had gone in pursuit of the fugitives, took
Hisar-firtiza at once on arrival, plundered it, and returned to us.
It was given in guerdon to Humayin, with all its dependencies
and appurtenances, with it also a kror of money.

We marched from that camp to Shahabad. After we had
despatched a news-gatherer (¢i#-titar kishiz) to Sl. Ibrahim’s
camp, we stayed a few days on that ground. Rahmat the
foot-man was sent with the letters of victory to Kabul.

(r. News of Ibrahim.)
(March 13th) On Monday the 28th of the first Jumada,' we
being in that same camp, the Sun entered the Sign of the Ram.

t At this place the Elphinstone Codex has preserved, interpolated in its text, a note
of Humiayiin’s on his first use of the razor. Part of it is written as by Babur :—


--- Page 33 ---
932 AH.—OCT. 18TH 1525 To OCT. 8TH 1526 AD. 467

News had come again and again from Ibrahim’s camp, “He is
coming, marching two miles” or “four miles”, “stopping in
each camp two days,” or “three days”. We for our part
advanced from Shahabad and after halting on two nights,
reached the bank of the Jiin-river (Jumna) and encamped
opposite Sarsawa. From that ground Khwaja Kalan’s servant
Haidar-quli was sent to get news (¢i/ tia).

Having crossed the Jiin-river at a ford, I visited Sarsawa.
That day also we ate maYiin. Sarsawa‘ has a source (chashma)
from which a smallish stream issues, not a bad place! Tardi
Beg khaksar praising it, I said, “Let it be thine!” so just
because he praised it, Sarsawa was given to him !

I had a platform fixed in a boat and used to go for
excursions on the river, sometimes too made the marches down
it. Two marches along its bank had been made when, of those
sent to gather news, Haidar-quli brought word that [brahim had
sent Daud Khan (Ladz) and Hatim Khan (Lid) across the
river into the Mian-di-ab (Tween-waters) with 5 or 6000 men,
and that these lay encamped some 6 or 7 miles from his own.

(s. A successful encounter.)

(April rst) On Sunday the 18th of the second Jumada,
we sent, to ride light against this force, Chin-timir Sultan,?

** Today in this same camp the razor or scissors was applied to Humayin’s face.”
Part is signed by Humayiin :—“‘ As the honoured dead, earlier in these Acts (wagi‘a)
mentions the first application of the razor to his own face (f. 120), so in imitation of
him I mention this. I was then at the age of 18 ; now I am at the age of 48, I who
am the sub-signed Muhammad Humiyiin.” A scribe’s note attests that this is
** copied from the hand-writing of that honoured one”. As Humiyiin’s 48th (lunar)
birthday occurred a month before he left Kabul, to attempt the re-conquest of
Hindistan, in November 1554 AD. (in the last month of 961 AH.), he was still 48
(lunar) years old on the day he re-entered Dihli on July 23rd 1555 Ap. (Ramzan Ist
962 AH.), so that this ‘‘ shaving passage” will have been entered within those dates.
That he should study his Father’s book at that time is natural ; his grandson Jahangir
did the same when going to Kabul; so doubtless would do its author’s more remote
descendants, the sons of Shah-jahan who reconquered Transoxiana.

(Concerning the ‘‘ shaving passage” wzde the notes on the Elphinstone Codex in
JRAS. 1900 p. 443, 451; 1902 p. 653; 1905 p. 754; and 1907 p. 131.)

* This ancient town of the Saharanpir district is associated with a saint revered by
Hindiis and Muhammadans. Cf. W. Crooke’s Popular Religion of Northern India
Pp. 133. Its chashma may be inferred (from Babur’s uses of the word g.v. Index) as
a water-head, a pool, a gathering place of springs.

? He was the eighth son of Babur’s maternal-uncle Sl. Ahmad Khan Chaghatai and
had fled to Babur, other brothers following him, from the service of their eldest
brother Mansiir, Khaqin of the Mughiils ( 7@rikh-2-rashidi trs. p. 161).

Mahdi Khwaja, Muhammad SI. Mirza, ‘Adil Sultan, and the
whole of the left, namely, Sl. Junaid, Shah Mir Husain, Qitliq-
qadam, and with them also sent ‘Abdu’l-lah and Kitta Beg (of
the centre). They crossed from our side of the water at the
Mid-day Prayer, and between the Afternoon and the Evening
Prayers bestirred themselves from the other bank.  Biban
having crossed the water on pretext of this movement, ran away.

(April 2nd) At day-break they came upon the ehemy ;* he
made as if coming out in a sort of array, but our men closed
with his at once, overcame them, hustled them off, pursued and
unhorsed them till they were opposite Ibrahim’s own camp.
Hatim Khan was one of those unhorsed, who was Daud Khan
(Lidz)’s elder brother and one of his commanders. Our men
brought him in when they waited on me. They brought also
60-70 prisoners and 6 or 7 elephants. Most of the prisoners,
by way of warning, were made to reach their death-doom.

(¢. Preparations for battle.)

While we were marching on in array of right, left and centre,
the army was numbered ;? it did not count up to what had
been estimated.

At our next camp it was ordered that every man in the army
should collect carts, each one according to his circumstances.
Seven hundred carts (avaba) were brought3 in. The order given

t farz-wagti, when there is light enough to distinguish one object from another.

2 dim kitriildi (Index s.n. dim). Herethe L. & EF. Afemozrs inserts an explanatory
passage in Persian about the dim. It will have been in one of the Wag?‘at-z-baburé
MSS, Erskine used ; it is in Muh. Shivazz’s lithograph copy of the Udaipir Codex
(p. 173). It is not in the Turki text or in all the MSS. of the Persian translation.
Manifestly, it was entered at a time when Babur’s term dim kariildi requires explana-
tion in Hindustan. The writer of it himself does not make details clear; he says only,
“Tt is manifest that people declare (the number) after counting the mounted army in
the way agreed upon amongst them, with a whip or a bow held in the hand.” This
explanation suggests that in the march-past the troops were measured off as so many
bow- or whip-lengths (Index s.2. dim).

3 These avaba may have been the baggage-carts of the army and also carts procured
on the spot. Erskine omits (/emoirs p. 304) the words which show how many carts
were collected and from whom. Doubtless it would be through not having these
circumstances in his mind that he took the avdéa for gun-carriages. His incomplete
translation, again, led Stanley Lane-Poole to write an interesting note in his Babur
(p. 161) to support Erskine against de Courteille (with whose rendering mine agrees)
by quoting the circumstance that Humayin had 700 guns at Qanauj in 1540 Ap. It
must be said in opposition to his support of Erskine’s ‘‘ gun-carriages” that there is
no textual or circumstantial warrant for supposing Babur to have had guns, even if

to Ustad ‘Ali-quli was that these carts should be joined together
in Ottoman* fashion, but using ropes of raw hide instead of
chains, and that between every two carts 5 or 6 mantelets should
be fixed, behind which the matchlockmen were to stand to fire.
To allow of collecting all appliances, we delayed 5 or 6 days in
that camp. When everything was ready, all the begs with such
braves as had had experience in military affairs were summoned
to a General Council where opinion found decision at this :—
Pani-pat? is there with its crowded houses and suburbs. It
would be on one side of us ; our other sides must be protected
by carts and mantelets behind which our foot and matchlockmen
would stand. With so much settled we marched forward, halted
one night on the way, and reached Pani-pat on Thursday the
last day (29th) of the second Jumada (April 12th).

(u. The opposed forces.)

On our right was the town of Pani-pat with its suburbs ; in
front of us were the carts and mantelets we had prepared ; on
our left and elsewhere were ditch and branch. At distances of Fol. 2640.
an arrow’s flight3 sally-places were left for from 100 to 200
horsemen.

Some in the army were very anxious and full of fear. Nothing
recommends anxiety and fear. For why? Because what God
has fixed in eternity cannot be changed. But though this is so,
it was no reproach to be afraid and anxious. For why? Because
those thus anxious and afraid were there with a two or three
months’ journey between them and their homes; our affair was

made in parts, in such number as to demand 700 gun-carriages for their transport.
What guns Babur had at Pani-pat will have been brought from his Kabul base ; if he
had acquired any, say from Lahor, he would hardly omit to mention such an important
reinforcement of his armament; if he had brought many guns on carts from Kabul, he
must have met with transit-difficulties harassing enough to chronicle, while he was
making that long journey from Kabul to Pani-pat, over passes, through skirt-hills and
many fords. The elephants he had in Bigram may have been his transport for what
guns he had ; he does not mention his number at Pani-pat ; he makes his victory a
bow-man’s success ; he can be read as indicating that he had two guns only.

* These Ottoman (text, Azz, Roman) defences Ustad ‘Ali-quli may have seen at
the battle of Chaldiran fought some 40 leagues from Tabriz between Sl. Salim Rimi
and Shah Isma ‘ll Safawi on Rajab Ist 920 AH. (Aug. 22nd 1514 aD.). Of this battle
Khwand-amir gives a long account, dwelling on the effective use made in it of chained
carts and palisades (Hadibw’s-siyar iii, part 4, p. 78; Akbar-nama trs. i, 241).

with a foreign tribe and people; none knew their tongue, nor
did they know ours :—

A wandering band, with mind awander ;
In the grip of a tribe, a tribe unfamiliar.*

People estimated the army opposing us at 100,000 men;
Ibrahim’s elephants and those of his amirs were said to be about
1000. In his hands was the treasure of two forbears.? In
Hindistan, when work such as this has to be done, it is
customary to pay out money to hired retainers who are known
as 6:d-hindi3 If it had occurred to Ibrahim to do this, he might
have had another /ak or two of troops. God brought it right !
Ibrahim could neither content his braves, nor share out his
treasure. How should he content his braves when he was ruled
by avarice and had a craving insatiable to pile coin on coin?
He was an unproved brave+; he provided nothing for his
military operations, he perfected nothing, nor stand, nor move,
nor fight.

In the interval at Pani-pat during which the army was
preparing defence on our every side with cart, ditch and branch,
Darwish-i-muhammad Sa@réan had once said to me, “With such
precautions taken, how is it possible for him to come?” Said
I, “Are you likening him to the Aitizbeg khans and sultans?

3 As to the form of this word the authoritative MSS. of the Turki text agree and
with them also numerous good ones of the Persian translation. I have made careful
examination of the word because it is replaced or explained here and there in MSS.
by s:46:ndi, the origin of which is said to be obscure. The sense of 6:d-hznadi and
of s:46:ndi is the same, ¢.e. irregular levy. The word as Babur wrote it must have
been understood by earlier Indian scribes of both the Turki and Persian texts of the
Babur-nama. Some light on its correctness may be thought given by Hobson Jobson
(Crooke’s ed. p. 136) s.2. Byde or Bede Horse, where the word Byde is said to be an
equivalent of pindari, liti, and gazzdg, raider, plunderer, so that Babur’s word
6:d-hindi may mean gaz2dg of Hind. Wherever I have referred to the word in many
MSS. it is pointed to read 4:d, and not p:d, thus affording no warrant for under-
standing fad, foot, foot-man, infantry, and also negativing the spelling 42d, 2.e. with
a long vowel as in Byde.

It may be noted here that Muh. Shirazi (p. 174) substituted s:44.:ndi for Babur’s
word and that this led our friend the late William Irvine to attribute mistake to
de aed who follows the Turki text (Army of the Mughils p. 66 and Afémoires
ii, 163).

In what of movement under arms or of planned operations is

he to be compared with them?” God brought it right! Things
fell out just as I said!

(Author’s note on the Aiizbeg chiefs.) When I reached Hisar in the year

I left Samarkand (918 AH.-1512 AD.), and all the Aiizbeg khans and sultans

gathered and came against us, we brought the families and the goods of the

Mughils and soldiers into the Hisar suburbs and fortified these by closing the

lanes. As those khans and sultans were experienced in equipment, in planned

operations, and in resolute resistance, they saw from our fortification of Hisar

that we were determined on life or death within it, saw they could not count

on taking it by assault and, therefore, retired at once from near Nandak of
Chaghanian.

(v. Preliminary encounters.)

During the 7 or 8 days we lay in Pani-pat, our men used to
go, a few together, close up to Ibrahim’s camp, rain arrows down
on his massed troops, cut off and bring in heads. Still he made
no move ; nor did his troops sally out. At length, we acted on
the advice of several Hindiistani well-wishers and sent out 4 or
5000 men to deliver a night-attack on his camp, the leaders of
it being Mahdi Khwaja, Muhammad Sl. Mirza, ‘Adil Sultan,
Khusrau, Shah Mir Husain, SI. Junaid Barlas, ‘Abdu’l-‘aziz the
Master of the Horse, Muh. ‘Ali /Jang-jang, Qitliiq-qadam,
Treasurer Wali, Khalifa’s Muhibb-i-‘ali, Pay-master Muhammad,
Jan Beg and Qara-qizi. It being dark, they were not able to
act together well, and, having scattered, could effect nothing on
arrival. They stayed near Ibrahim’s camp till dawn, when the
nagarets sounded and troops of his came out in array with
elephants. Though our men did not do their work, they got
off safe and sound ; not a man of them was killed, though they
were in touch with such a mass of foes. One arrow pierced
Muh. ‘Ali Jang-jang’s leg ; though the wound was not mortal,
he was good-for-nothing on the day of battle.

On hearing of this affair, I sent off Humayiin and his troops
to go 2 or 3 miles to meet them, and followed him myself with
the rest of the army in battle-array. The party of the night-
attack joined him and came back with him. The enemy making
no further advance, we returned to camp and dismounted. That
night a false alarm fell on the camp; for some 20 minutes (one
garz) there were uproar and call-to-arms ; the disturbance died
down after a time.

(April 20th) On Friday the 8th of Rajab,? news came, when

* Well-known are the three decisive historical battles fought near the town of
Pani-pat, vs. those of Babur and Ibrahim in 1526, of Akbar and Himii in 1556, and
of Ahmad Aédalz with the Mahratta Confederacy in 1761. The following lesser
particulars about the battle-field are not so frequently mentioned :—(¢) that the scene
of Babur’s victory was long held to be haunted, Badayini himself, passing it at dawn
some 62 years later, heard with dismay the din of conflict and the shouts of the com-
batants ; (27) that Babur built a (perhaps commemorative) mosque one mile to the
n.e, of the town ; (772) that one of the unaccomplished desires of Sher Shah Sir, the
conqueror of Babur’s son Humayiin, was to raise two monuments on the battle-field
of Pani-pat, one to Ibrahim, the other to those Chaghatai sultans whose martyrdom
he himself had brought about ; (¢v) that in 1910 Ap. the British Government placed
a monument to mark the scene of Shah Aéda/i’s victory of 1761 AD. This monument
would appear, from Sayyid Ghulam-i-‘ali’s Wigdr-ndma-t-hind, to stand close to the
scene of Babur’s victory also, since the Mahrattas were entrenched as he was outside
the town of Pant-pat. (Cf. E. & D. viii, 401.) :

narrative allows of his delivering attack, through the wide sally-ports, after arraying
behind the carts and mantelets which checked his adversary’s swift advance. The
Mahrattas, who may have occupied the same ground as Babur, fortified themselves
more strongly than he did, as having powerful artillery against them. Ahmad Shah
Abdali’s defence against them was an ordinary ditch and adéa/¢is, [Babur’s ditch and

the Master of the Horse was posted as the reserve. For the
turning-party (¢i#/ghuma) at the point of the right wing,' we
fixed on Red Wali and Malik Qasim (brother) of Baba Qashga,
with their Mughils ; for the turning-party at the point of the
left wing, we arrayed Qara-qitizi, Abi’l-muhammad the lance-
player, Shaikh Jamal Sarin’s Shaikh ‘Ali, Mahndi(?) and
Tingri-birdi Bashaghi(?) Mughil; these two parties, directly
the enemy got near, were to turn his rear, one from the right,
the other from the left.

When the dark mass of the enemy first came in sight, he
seemed to incline towards our right ; ‘Abdu’l-‘aziz, who was the
right-reserve, was sent therefore to reinforce the right. From
the time that Sl. Ibrahim’s blackness first appeared, he moved
swiftly, straight for us, without a check, until he saw the dark
mass of our men, when his pulled up and, observing our formation
and array,? made as if asking, “To stand or not? To advance
or not?” They could not stand; nor could they make their
former swift advance.

Our orders were for the turning-parties to wheel from right
and left to the enemy’s rear, to discharge arrows and to engage
in the fight ; and for the right and left (wings) to advance and
join battle with him. The turning-parties wheeled round and
began to rain arrows down. Mahdi Khwaja was the first of the
left to engage ; he was faced by a troop having an elephant with
it ; his men’s flights of arrows forced it to retire. To reinforce
the left I sent Secretary Ahmadi and also Qij Beg’s Tardi Beg
and Khalifa’s Muhibb-i-‘ali. On the right also there was some
stubborn fighting. Orders were given for Muhammadi Kikildash,
Shah Mansi Sarlas, Yiinas-i-‘ali and ‘Abdu'l-lah to engage
those facing them in front of the centre. From that same
position Ustad ‘Ali-quli made good discharge of firzngz shots ;3

Mustafa the commissary for his part made excellent discharge
of sarb-san shots from the left hand of the centre. Our right,
left, centre and turning-parties having surrounded the enemy,
rained arrows down on him and fought ungrudgingly. He
made one or two small charges on our right and left but under
our men’s arrows, fell back on his own centre. His right and
left hands (g#/) were massed in such a crowd that they could
neither move forward against us nor force a way for flight.

When the incitement to battle had come, the Sun was spear-

to Ibrahim. Our estimate of the other dead, lying all over the
field, was 15 to 16,000, but it came to be known, later in Agra
from the statements of Hindiistanis, that 40 or 50,000 may have
died in that battle.'

The foe defeated, pursuit and unhorsing of fugitives began.
Our men brought in amirs of all ranks and the chiefs they
captured ; #ahauts made offering of herd after herd of elephants.

Ibrahim was thought to have fled ; therefore, while pursuing
the enemy, we told off Qismatai Mirza, Baba chuhra and Bijka
of the £hasa-tabin? to lead swift pursuit to Agra and try to
take him. We passed through his camp, looked into his own

enclosure (saracha) and quarters, and dismounted on the bank

a Although the authority of the Tarikh-i-salatin-i-afaghana is not weighty its
reproduction of Afghan opinion is worth consideration. It says that astrologers fore-
told Ibrahim’s defeat ; that his men, though greatly outnumbering Babur’s, were
out-of-heart through his ill-treatment of them, and his amirs in displeasure against
him, but that never-the-less, the conflict at Pani-pat was more desperate than had
ever been seen. It states that Ibrahim fell where his tomb now is (te. in cérca
1002 AH.-1594 AD.); that Babur went to the spot and, prompted by his tender
heart, lifted up the head of his dead adversary, and said, ‘‘ Honour to your courage !”’,
ordered brocade and sweetmeats made ready, enjoined Dilawar Khan and Khalifa to
bathe the corpse and to bury it where it lay (E. & D. v, 2). Naturally, part of the
reverence shewn to the dead would be the burial together of head and trunk.

On that very same day we appointed Humayiin Mirza? to
ride fast and light to Agra with Khwaja Kalan, Muhammadi,
Shah Manstr Barlas, Yinas-i-‘ali, ‘Abdu’l-lah and Treasurer
Wali, to get the place into their hands and to mount guard over
the treasure. We fixed on Mahdi Khwaja, with Muhammad
SI. Mirza, ‘Adil Sultan, Sl. Junaid Bardas and Qitliiq-qadam to
leave their baggage, make sudden incursion on Dihli, and keep
watch on the treasuries.3

(April 21st) We marched on next day and when we had gone
2 miles, dismounted, for the sake of the horses, on the bank of
the Jin (Jumna).

(April 24th) On Tuesday (Rajab 12th), after we had halted
on two nights and had made the circuit of Shaikh Nizamu’d-din
Auliyas tomb* we dismounted on the bank of the Jiin over
against Dihli.5 That same night, being Wednesday-eve, we made
an excursion into the fort of Dihli and there spent the night.

(April 25th) Next day (Wednesday Rajab 13th) I made the
circuit of Khwaja Qutbu’d-din’s® tomb and visited the tombs
and residences of Sl. Ghiyasu’d-din Balban7 and S). ‘Alau’u’d-din

™ He was a brother of Muhibb-i-‘ali’s mother.

? To give Humayiin the title Mirza may be a scribe’s lapse, but might also be
a nuance of Babur’s, made to shew, with other #z¢utiae, that Humayiin was in chief
command. The other minute matters are that instead of Humayiin’s name being the
first of a simple series of commanders’ names with the enclitic accusative appended
to the last one (here Wali), as is usual, Humayiin’s name has its own enclitic #7 ;
and, again, the phrase is ‘* Mzmdayitn with” such and such begs, a turn of expression
differentiating him from the rest. The same unusual variations occur again, just below,
perhaps with the same intention of shewing chief command, there of Mahdi Khwaja.

3 A small matter of wording attracts attention in the preceding two sentences.
Babur, who does not always avoid verbal repetition, here constructs two sentences
which, except for the place-names Dihli and Agra, convey information of precisely
the same action in entirely different words.

4 d. 1325 AD. The places Babur visited near Dihli are described in the Reports
of the Indian Archaeological Survey, in Sayyid Ahmad’s Asar Sanddid pp. 74-85, in
Keene’s Hand-book to Dihli and Murray’s Hand-book to Bengal etc. The last two

(April 27th) On Friday (Rajab 15th) while we remained on

a few others into Dihli for the Congregational Prayer, read the
khutba in my name, distributed a portion of money to the poor

as the place was far from the fort, moved on the following day
to Jalal Khan /ég-ha?’s house.

On Humayin’s arrival at Agra, ahead of us, the garrison had
made excuses and false pretexts (about surrender), He and his

may be laid on the Treasury ”! and so sat down to watch the
roads out of Agra till we should come.

* ‘Alau’u’d-din Muh, Shah A%i7i Turk d. 1316 ap. It is curious that Babur
should specify visiting his Minar (#¢v@ri, Pers. trs. 1.0. 217 f. 1856, mzna@r-i-au) and
not mention the Qutb Minar. Possibly he confused the two. The ‘Aldi Minar
remains unfinished ; the Qutb is judged by Cunningham to have been founded by
Qutbu’d-din Aibak Turk, circa 1200 ap. and to have been completed by Sl. Shamsu’d-
din Altamsh (Ailtimish ?) Zur, circa 1220 AD. Of the two tanks Babur visited, the
Royal-tank (fausz-é-4442) was made by ‘Alau’u’d-din in 1293 AD.

* The familiar Turki word Tiighligq would reinforce much else met with in Dihli
to strengthen Babur’s opinion that, as a Turk, he had a right to rule there. Many,
if not all, of the Slave dynasty were Turks ; these were followed by the Khilji Turks,
these again by the Taghliiqs. Moreover the Panj-ab he had himself taken, and lands
on both sides of the Indus further south had been ruled by Ghaznawid Turks. His
latest conquests were ‘‘where the Turk had ruled” (f. 2264) long, wide, and with
interludes only of non-Turki sway.

(z. The great diamond.)

In Sultan Ibrahim’s defeat the Raja of Gialiar Bikramajit the
Hindi had gone to hell.

(Author's note on Bikraméjit.) The ancestors of Bikramajit had ruled in
Gialiar for more than a hundred years. Sikandar (Z#dz) had sat down in
Agra for several years in order to take the fort; later on, in Ibrahim’s time,
‘Azim Humayiin Sarwani 3 had completely invested it for some while ; following
this, it was taken on terms under which Shamsabad was given in exchange
for it.4

Bikramajit’s children and family were in Agra at the time of
Ibrahim’s defeat. When Humayiin reached Agra, they must
have been planning to flee, but his postings of men (to watch
the roads) prevented this and guard was kept over them.
Humiayin himself did not let them go (4arghali qiimas). They
made him a voluntary offering of a mass of jewels and valuables
amongst which was the famous diamond which ‘Alau’u’d-din
must have brought.5 Its reputation is that every appraiser has
estimated its value at two and a half days’ food for the whole
world. Apparently it weighs 8 mzsga/s.° Humayiin offered it
to me when I arrived at Agra; I just gave it him back.

EXPEDITIONS OF TRAMONTANE MUHAMMADANS

(a. Babur’s five attempts on Hindistan.)

From the date 910 at which the country of Kabul was con-
quered, down to now (932 AH.) (my) desire for Hindiistan had
been constant, but owing sometimes to the feeble counsels of
begs, sometimes to the non-accompaniment of elder and younger
brethren, a move on Hindiistan had not been practicable and its
territories had remained unsubdued. At length no such obstacles
were left ; no beg, great or small (deg begat) of lower birth,5 could
speak an opposing word. In 925 AH. (1519 AD.) we led an army
out and, after taking Bajaur by storm in 2-3 gar? (44-66 minutes),
and making a general massacre of its people, went on into Bhira.
Bhira we neither over-ran nor plundered ; we imposed a ransom
on its people, taking from them in money and goods to the value

me to suit Babur’s uses of the term, inasmuch as both seem to go too low (cf. f. 2708).

of 4 laks of shahrukhis and having shared this out to the army
and auxiliaries, returned to Kabul. From then till now we
laboriously held tight? to Hindistan, five times leading an army
into it? The fifth time, God the Most High, by his own mercy
and favour, made such a foe as Sl. Ibrahim the vanquished and
loser, such a realm as Hindiistan our conquest and possession.

(6. Three invaders from Tramontana.)

From the time of the revered Prophet down till now 3 three
men from that side + have conquered and ruled Hindistan. SI.
Mahmiid G/azz5 was the first, who and whose descendants sat
long on the seat of government in Hindistan. Sl]. Shihabu’d-din
of Ghir was the second,® whose slaves and dependants royally
shepherded 7 this realm for many years. I am the third.

But my task was not like the task of those other rulers. For
why? Because S]. Mahmid, when he conquered Hindistan, had
the throne of Khurasan subject to his rule, vassal and obedient to
him were the sultans of Khwarizm and the Marches (Daru’l-marz),
and under his hand was the ruler of Samarkand. Though his
army may not have numbered 2 /aks, what question is there that
it® was one. Then again, rajas were his opponents ; all Hindi-
stan was not under one supreme head (fadshah), but each raja
ruled independently in his own country. Sl. Shihabu’d-din again,
—though he himself had no rule in Khurasan, his elder brother
Ghiyasu’d-din had it. The 7abagat-i-nasiri9 brings it forward

person, and may be that of his troops accompanying ‘Alam Khan in 931 AH. But
he may count into the set of five, the one made in 910 AH. which he himself meant
to cross the Indus. Various opinions are found expressed by European writers as to
the dates of the five.

that he once led into Hindiistaén an army of 120,000 men and
horse in mail! His opponents also were rais and rajas; one
man did not hold all Hindiistan.

That time we came to Bhira, we had ‘at most some 1500 to
2000 men. We had made no previous move on Hindistan with
an army equal to that which came the fifth time, when we beat
Sl. Ibrahim and conquered the realm of Hindistan, the total
written down for which, taking one retainer with another, and
with traders and servants, was 12,000. Dependent on me were
the countries of Badakhshan, Qiindiiz, Kabul and Qandahar, but
no reckonable profit came from them, rather it was necessary to
reinforce them fully because several lie close to an enemy. Then
again, all Mawara’u’n-nahr was in the power of the Atzbeg khans
and sultans, an ancient foe whose armies counted up to 100,000.
Moreover Hindistan, from Bhira to Bihar, was in the power of
the Afghans and in it Sl. Ibrahim was supreme. In proportion
to his territory his army ought to have been 5 Zaks, but at that
time the Eastern amirs were in hostility to him. His army was
estimated at 100,000 and people said his elephants and those of
his amirs were 1000.

Under such conditions, in this strength, and having in my rear
100,000 old enemies such as are the Aiizbegs, we put trust in God
and faced the ruler of such a dense army and of domains so wide.
As our trust was in Him, the most high God did not make our
labour and hardships vain, but defeated that powerful foe and
conquered that broad realm. Not as due to strength and effort
of our own do we look upon this good fortune, but as had solely
through God’s pleasure and kindness. We know that this
happiness was not the fruit of our own ambition and resolve, but
that it was purely from His mercy and favour.

DESCRIPTION OF HINDUSTAN.

of produce. On the east, south, and even on the west, it ends at

it has mountains which connect: with those of Hindi-kush,
Kafiristan and Kashmir. North-west of it lie Kabul, Ghazni
and Qandahar. Dihli is held (azrimish) to be the capital of the
whole of Hindiistan. From the death of Shihabu’d-din Ghiri
(d. 602 AH.—1206 AD.) to the latter part of the reign of Sl]. Firaz
Shah (Tighligq Turk d. 790 AH.—1388 AD.), the greater part of
Hindiistan must have been under the rule of the sultans of Dihli.

(6. Rulers contemporary with Babur’s conquest.)

At the date of my conquest of Hindiistan it was governed by
five Musalman rulers (padshah)* and two Pagans (kajir). These
were the respected and independent rulers, but there were also,
in the hills and jungles, many rais and rajas, held in little esteem
(kichik karim).

First, there were the Afghans who had possession of Dihli, the
capital, and held the country from Bhira to Bihar. Jinpiir, before
their time, had been in possession of S]. Husain Shargi (Eastern)?
whose dynasty Hindiistanis call Pirabi (Eastern). His ancestors
will have been cup-bearers in the presence of SJ. Firiiz Shah
and those (Tighliiq) sultans; they became supreme in Jinpir
after his death3 At that time Dihli was in the hands of
Sl. ‘Alau’u’d-din (‘Alam Khan) of the Sayyid dynasty to whose
ancestor Timir Beg had given it when, after having captured it,
he went away.+ Sl]. Buhlal Zadz and his son (Sikandar) got
possession of the capital Jinpir and the capital Dihli, and
brought both under one government (881 AH.—1476 AD.)..

Secondly, there was Sl. Muhammad Muzaffer in Gujrat; he
departed from the world a few days before the defeat of
Sl. Ibrahim. He was skilled in the Law, a ruler ( padshah) seeking
after knowledge, and a constant copyist of the Holy Book. His
dynasty people call Tank. His ancestors also will have been

* The numerous instances of the word padshah in this part of the Babur-nama
imply no such distinction as attaches to the title Emperor by which it is frequently
translated (Index s.2. padshah).

2 d. 1500 AD. (905 AH.).
3 d. 1388 AD. (790 AH.).

4 The ancestor mentioned appears to be Nasrat Shah, a grandson of Firiz Shah
Tughlig (S. L.-Poole p. 300 and Beale, 298).

5 His family belonged to the Rajput sept of Tank, and had become Muhammadan

in the person of Sadharan the first ruler of Gujrat (Crooke’s 7ribes and Castes;
Mirat-i-sikandari, Bayley p. 67 and n.).

wine-servers to Sl. Firiiz Shah and those (Tighliq) sultans ; they
became possessed of Gujrat after his death.

Thirdly, there were the Bahmanis of the Dakkan (Deccan, ze.
South), but at the present time no indepéndent authority is left
them ; their great begs have laid hands on the whole country,
and must be asked for whatever is needed."

Fourthly, there was Sl. Mahmiid in the country of Malwa,
which people call also Mandai.? His dynasty they call Khilij
(Turk). Rana Sanga had defeated SI. Mahmiid and taken
possession of most of his country. This dynasty also has
become feeble. Sl. Mahmiid’s ancestors also must have been
cherished by Sl. Firiiz Shah ; they became possessed of the
Malwa country after his death.3

Fifthly, there was Nasrat Shah4 in the country of Bengal.
His father (Husain Shah), a sayyid styled ‘Alau’u’d-din, had
ruled in Bengal and Nasrat Shah attained to rule by inheritance.
A surprising custom in Bengal is that hereditary succession is
rare. The royal office is permanent and there are permanent
offices of amirs, wazirs and mansab-dars (officials). It is the
office that Bengalis regard with respect. Attached to each
office is a body of obedient, subordinate retainers and servants.
If the royal heart demand that a person should be dismissed
and another be appointed to sit in his place, the whole body of
subordinates attached to that office become the (new) office-
holder’s. There is indeed this peculiarity of the royal office
itself that any person who kills the ruler (d@dsha@h) and seats
himself on the throne, becomes ruler himself; amirs, wazirs,
soldiers and peasants submit to him at once, obey him, and
recognize him for the rightful ruler his predecessor in office had
been.S Bengalis say, “ We are faithful to the throne ; we loyally

t S. L.-Poole p. 316-7.

? Mandaii (Mandi) was the capital of Malwa.

3 Stanley Lane-Poole shews (p. 311) a dynasty of three Ghiiris interposed between

the death of Firiz Shah in 790 al. and the accession in 839 AH. of the first Khilji
ruler of Gujrat Mahmniid Shah.

4 He reigned from 1518 to 1532 AD. (925 to 939 AH. S.L.-P. p. 308) and had to
wife a daughter of Ibrahim Liat (Rzyazu’s-salatin). His dynasty was known as the
Husain-shahi, after his father.

BP " Strange as this custom may seem, a similar one prevailed down to a very late
period in Malabar. There was @ jubilee every 12 years in the Samorin’s country, and
any-one who succeeded in forcing his way through the Samorin’s guards and slew

932 AH.—OCT. 18TH 1525 To OCT. 8TH 1526 AD. 483

obey whoever occupies it.” As for instance, before the reign of
Nasrat Shah’s father ‘Alau’u’d-din, an Abyssinian (Hadshi,
named Muzaffar Shah) had killed his sovereign (Mahmid
Shah J/yas), mounted the throne and ruled for some time.
‘Alau’u’d-din killed that Abyssinian, seated himself on the throne
and became ruler. When he died, his son (Nasrat) became
ruler by inheritance. Another Bengali custom is to regard it
as a disgraceful fault in a new ruler if he expend and consume
the treasure of his predecessors. On coming to rule he must
gather treasure of his own. To amass treasure Bengalis regard
as a glorious distinction. Another custom in Bengal is that
from ancient times parganas have been assigned to meet the
charges of the treasury, stables, and all royal expenditure and
to defray these charges no impost is laid on other lands.

These five, mentioned above, were the great Musalman rulers,
honoured in Hindistan, many-legioned, and broad-landed. Of
the Pagans the greater both in territory and army, is the Raja
of Bijanagar."

The second is Rana Sanga who in these latter days had
grown great by his own valour and sword. His original country
was Chitiir ; in the downfall from power of the Mandai sultans,
he became possessed of many of their dependencies such as
Rantanbir, Sarangpir, Bhilsan and Chandiri. Chandiri I stormed
in 934 AH. (1528 A.D.)? and, by God’s pleasure, took it in a few
hours; in it was Rana Sanga’s great and trusted man Midni

him, reigned in his stead. ‘A jubilee is proclaimed throughout his dominions at the
end of 12 years, and a tent is pitched for him in a spacious plain, and a great feast
is celebrated for 10 or 12 days with mirth and jollity, guns firing night and day, so,
at the end of the feast, any four of the guests that have a mind to gain a throne by
a desperate action in fighting their way through 30 or 40,000 of his guards, and kill
the Samorin in his tent, he that kills him, succeeds him in his empire.” See Hamilton’s
New Account of the East Indies vol. i. p. 309. The attempt was made in 1695, and
again a very few years ago, but without success” (Erskine p. 311).

The custom Babur writes of—it is one dealt with at length in Frazer’s Golden
Bough—would appear from Blochmann’s Geography and History of Bengal (JASB
1873 p. 286) to have been practised by the Habshi rulers of Bengal of whom he
quotes Faria y Souza as saying, ‘‘ They observe no rule of inheritance from father to
son, but even slaves sometimes obtain it by killing their master, and whoever holds
it three days, they look upon as established by divine providence. Thus it fell out
that in 40 years space they had 13 kings successively.”

* No doubt this represents Vijayanagar in the Deccan.

? This date places the composition of the Description of Hindustan in agreement
with Shaikh Zain’s statement that it was in writing in 935 AH.

towns, its cultivated lands, its animals and plants, its peoples

some respects the hot-country (garm-si/) that depends on Kabul,

After crossing the Sind-river (eastwards), there are countries,
in the northern mountains mentioned above, appertaining to
Kashmir and once included in it, although most of them, as for
example, Pakli and Shahmang (?), do not now obey it. Beyond
Kashmir there are countless peoples and hordes, parganas and
cultivated lands, in the mountains. As far as Bengal, as far
indeed as the shore of the great ocean, the peoples are without
break. About this procession of men no-one has been able
to give authentic information in reply to our enquiries and
investigations. So far people have been saying that they call
these hill-men Xas.' It has struck me that as a Hindistani
pronounces shin as sin (ze. sh as s), and as Kashmir is the one
respectable town in these mountains, no other indeed being
heard of, Hindiistanis might pronounce it Kasmir.2 These

* Are they the Khas of Nepal and Sikkim ? (G. of I.).

® Ifere Erskine notes that the Persian (trs.) adds, ‘‘ mir signifying a hill, and Aas
being the name of the natives of the hill-country.” This may not support the name

Aas as correct but may be merely an explanation of Babur’s meaning. It is not in
1.0. 217 f. 189 or in Muh. Shirazi’s lithographed Wagi‘at-i-baburi p. 190. .

people trade in musk-bags, 6-:4ri-qiitas,’ saffron, lead and
copper.

Hindis call these mountains Sawalak-parbat. In the Hindi
tongue sawdi-/ak means one lak and a quarter, that is, 125,000,
and parbat means a hill, which makes 125,000 hills.2_ The snow
on these mountains never lessens; it is seen white from many
districts of Hind, as, for example, Lahor, Sihrind and Sambal.
The range, which in Kabul is known as Hindi-kush, comes from
Kabul eastwards into Hindustan, with slight inclination to the
south. The Hindistanat 3 are to the south of it. Tibet lies to
the north of it and of that unknown horde called Kas.

(e. Of rivers.)

Many rivers rise in these mountains and flow through Hindi-
stan. Six rise north of Sihrind, namely Sind, Bahat (Jilam),
Chan-ab [szc], Rawi, Biah, and Sutluj+; all meet near Multan,
flow westwards under the name of Sind, pass through the Tatta
country and fall into the ‘Uman(-sea).

Besides these six there are others, such as Jiin (Jumna), Gang
(Ganges), Rahap (Rapti?), Gimti, Gagar (Ghaggar), Sirti, Gandak,
and many more; all unite with the Gang-darya, flow east under
its name, pass through the Bengal country, and are poured into
the great ocean. They all rise in the Sawalak-parbat.

Many rivers rise in the Hindistan hills, as, for instance,
Chambal, Banas, Bitwi, and Sin (Son). There is no snow what-
ever on these mountains. Their waters also join the Gang-darya.

Cf. Of the Aravalli.)

Another Hindistan range runs north and south. It begins in
the Dihli country at a small rocky hill on which is Firiz Shah’s
residence, called Jahan-nama,5 and, going on from there, appears
near Dihli in detached, very low, scattered here and there, rocky

may be the Zafar-nama (Bib. Ind. ed. ii, 149).

little hills.t Beyond Miwat, it enters the Biana country. The
hills of Sikri, Bari and Dilpiir are also part of this same including
(¢ata)range. The hills of Gialiar—they write it Galiir—although
they do not connect with it, are off-sets of this range ; so are the
hills of Rantanbiir, Chitir, Chandiri, and Mandat. They are cut
off from it in some places by 7 to 8 kurohs (14 to 16 m.). These
hills are very low, rough, rocky and jungly. No snow whatever
falls on them. They are the makers, in Hindistan, of several
rivers.

(g. Lrrigation.)

The greater part of the Hindiistan country is situated on level
land. Many though its towns and cultivated lands are, it nowhere
has running waters.? Rivers and, in some places, standing-waters
are its “running-waters” (a@gar-silar). Even where, as for some
towns, it is practicable to convey water by digging channels (@7iq),
this is not done. For not doing it there may be several reasons,
one being that water is not at all a necessity in cultivating crops
and orchards. Autumn crops grow by the downpour of the rains
themselves ; and strange it is that spring crops grow even when
no rain falls. To young trees water is made to flow by means of
buckets or a wheel. They are given water constantly during two
or three years ; after which they need no more. Some vegetables
are watered constantly.

In Lahor, Dibalpir and those parts, people water by means
of a wheel. They make two circles of ropes long enough to
suit the depth of the well, fix strips of wood between them, and
on these fasten pitchers. The ropes with the wood and attached
pitchers are put over the well-wheel. At one end of the wheel-
axle a second wheel is fixed, and close (gash) to it another on
an upright axle. This last wheel the bullock turns; its teeth
catch in the teeth of the second, and thus the wheel with the
pitchers is turned. A trough is set where the water empties from
the pitchers and from this the water is conveyed everywhere,

* parcha parcha, hichikrak kichikrak, anda minda, tashlig tagghina. The
Gazetteer of India (1907 i, 1) puts into scientific words, what Babur here describes,
the ruin of a great former range.

* Here dyar-siilar might safely be replaced by ‘‘ irrigation channels” (Index s.7.).

932 AH.—OCT. 18rH 1525 To OCT. 8TH 1526 AD. 487

In Agra, Chandwar, Biana and those parts, again, people
water with a bucket ; this is a laborious and filthy way. At the
well-edge they set up a fork of wood, having a roller adjusted
between the forks, tie a rope to a large bucket, put the rope
over the roller, and tie its other end to the bullock. One person
must drive the bullock, another empty the bucket. Every time
the bullock turns after having drawn the bucket out of the well,
that rope lies on the bullock-track, in pollution of urine and
dung, before it descends again into the well. To some crops
needing water, men and women carry it by repeated efforts in
pitchers."

(h. Other particulars about Hindiistan.)

The towns and country of Hindistan are greatly wanting in
charm. Its towns and lands are all of one sort; there are no
walls to the orchards (4aghat), and most places are on the dead
level plain. Under the monsoon-rains the banks of some of its
rivers and torrents are worn into deep channels, difficult and
troublesome to pass through anywhere. In many parts of the
plains thorny jungle grows, behind the good defence of which
the people of the fargana become stubbornly rebellious and pay
no taxes.

Except for the rivers and here and there standing-waters,
there is little “running-water”. So much so is this that towns
and countries subsist on the water of wells or on such as collects
in tanks during the rains.

In Hindistan hamlets and villages, towns indeed; are
depopulated and set up in a moment! If the people of a large
town, one inhabited for years even, flee from it, they do it in
such a way that not a sign or trace of them remains in a day or
a day and a half? On the other hand, if they fix their eyes on

to their strength, issue from their beloved homes, and take the direction of a country
(if such can be found,) exempt from the miseries of war; sometimes of a strong
fortress, but more generally of the most unfrequented hills and woods, where they
prolong a miserable existence until the departure of the enemy, and if this should be

a place in which to settle, they need not dig water-courses or
construct dams because their crops are all rain-grown,” and as
the population of Hindistan is unlimited, it swarms in. They
make a tank or dig a well; they need not build houses or set
up walls—has-grass (Andropogon muricatum) abounds, wood
is unlimited, huts are made, and straightway there is a village
or a town!

(¢. Fauna of Hindistan :—Mammals.)

The elephant, which Hindistanis call Aa¢(h)z, is one of the
wild animals peculiar to Hindistan. It inhabits the (western ?)
borders of the Kalpi country, and becomes more numerous in
its wild state the further east one goes (in Kalpi?). From this
tract it is that captured elephants are brought; in Karrah and
Manikpir elephant-catching is the work of 30 or 40 villages.?
People answer (jawdab birurlar) for them direct to the exchequer.3
The elephant is an immense animal and very sagacious. If
people speak to it, it understands; if they command anything
from it, it does it. Its value is according to its size ; it is sold
by measure (ga@rt/ab) ; the larger it is, the higher its price. People

protracted beyond the time for which they have provided food, a large portion
necessarily dies of hunger.’ See the note itself. The Historical Sketches should be
read by every-one who desires to have an accurate idea of the South of India. It is
to be regretted that we do not possess the history of any other part of India, written
with the same knowledge or research.”

“The word wzsa or walsa is Dravidian. Telugu has valasa, ‘ emigration, flight,
or removing from home for fear of a hostile army.’ Kanarese has va/asé, dlas¢, and
dlisé, ‘flight, a removing from home for fear of a hostile army.’ Tamil has vadased,
“flying for fear, removing hastily.’ The word is an interesting one. I feel pretty
sure it is not Aryan, but Dravidian; and yet it stands alone in Dravidian, with
nothing that I can find in the way of a root or affinities to explain its etymology.
Possibly it may be a borrowed word in Dravidian. Malayalam has no corresponding
word. Can it have been borrowed from Kolarian or other primitive Indian speech ?”
(Letter to H. Beveridge from Mr. F. E. Pargiter, 8th August, 1914.)

Wulsa seems to be a derivative from Sanscrit #/vash, and to answer to Persian
wairani and Turki bazighlighi.

* lalmi, which in Afghani (Pushtii) signifies grown without irrigation.

2 “* The improvement of Hindistin since Babur’s time must be prodigious. The
wild elephant is now confined to the forests under Hemala, and to the Ghats of
Malabar. A wild elephant near Karrah, Manikpir, or Kalpi, is a thing, at the
present day (1826 An.), totally unknown. May not their familiar existence in these
countries down to Babur’s days, be considered rather hostile to the accounts given of
the superabundant population of Hindiistan in remote times?” (Erskine).

rumour that it is heard of in some islands as 10 garz* high, but
in this tract it? is not seen above 4 or 5. It eats and drinks
entirely with its trunk ; if it lose the trunk, it cannot live. It
has two great teeth (tusks) in its upper jaw, one on each side of
its trunk; by setting these against walls and trees, it brings
them down; with these it fights and does whatever hard tasks
fall to it. People call these ivory (‘a/, var. gha7) ; they are highly
valued by Hindistanis. The'elephant hasnohair3 It is much
relied on by Hindistanis, accompanying every troop of their
armies. It has some useful qualities :—it crosses great rivers
with ease, carrying a mass of baggage, and three or four have
gone dragging without trouble the cart of the mortar (gazdn) it
takes four or five hundred men to haul.4 But its stomach is
large; one elephant eats the corn (d%éghiz) of two strings (gztar)
of camels.5

The rhinoceros is another. This also is a large animal, equal
in bulk to perhaps three buffaloes. The opinion current in those
countries (Tramontana) that it can lift an elephant on its horn,
seems mistaken. It has a single horn on its nose, more than
nine inches (garish) long ; one of two garish is not seen. Out
of one large horn were made a drinking-vessel7 and a dice-box,
leaving over [the thickness of] 3 or 4 hands.2 The rhinoceros’

its equivalents, the ell (Zenker), is a variable measure ; it seems to approach more
nearly to a yard than to a gaz of 24 inches. See Memozrs of Jahangir (R. & B.

hide is very thick ; an arrow shot from a stiff bow, drawn with
full strength right up to the arm-pit, if it pierce at all, might
penetrate 4 inches (ai/7k, hands). From the sides (gash) of its
fore and hind legs," folds hang which from a distance look like
housings thrown over it. It resembles the horse more than it
does any other animal.?_ As the horse has a small stomach
(appetite ?), so has the rhinoceros ; as in the horse a piece of
bone (pastern?) grows in place of small bones (T. ashig, Fr.
osselets (Zenker), knuckles), so one grows in the rhinoceros; as
in the horse’s hand (ai/zk, Pers. dast) there is kiimik (or gimiih,
a tzb¢a, or marrow), so there is in the rhinoceros.3 It is more
ferocious than the elephant and cannot be made obedient and
submissive. There are masses of it in the Parashawar and
Hashnagar jungles, so too between the Sind-river and the jungles
of the Bhira country. Masses there are also on the banks of
the Sarii-river in Hindiistan. Some were killed in the Parashawar
and Hashnagar jungles in our moves on Hindustan. It strikes
powerfully with its horn; men and horses enough have been
horned in those hunts.4 In one of them the horse of a chuhra
(brave) named Magsiid was tossed a spear’s-length, for which
reason the man was nick-named the rhino’s aim (saqstid-c-karg).

The wild-buffaloS is another. It is much larger than the
(domestic) buffalo and its horns do not turn back in the same
way It isa mightily destructive and ferocious animal.

The xzla-gai (blue-bull)7 is another. It may stand as high
as a horse but is somewhat lighter in build. The male is bluish-
gray, hence, seemingly, people call it nila-gaz. It has two
rather small horns. On its throat is a tuft of hair, nine inches
long ; (in this) it resembles the yak.8 Its hoof is cleft (airz)

' lit. hand (g#/) and leg (427).

classification of them as two of the three Ungulata vera, the third being the tapir

like the hoof of cattle. The doe is of the colour of the daghi-
maral*; she, for her part, has no horns and is plumper than
the male.

The hog-deer (kotah-paicha) is another.2 It may be of the
size of the white deer (dg #zyik). It has short legs, hence its
name, little-legged. Its horns are like a déghi’s but smaller ;
like the daghv it casts them every year. Being rather a poor
runner, it does not leave the jungle.

Another is a deer (£zyzk) after the fashion of the male deer
(airkaki hiina) of the jiran.3 Its back is black, its belly white, its
horns longer than the ##za’s, but more crooked. A Hindistani
calls it kalahara,* a word which may have been originally kala
-haran, black-buck, and which has been softened in pronunciation
to kalahara. The doe is light-coloured. By means of this
kalahara people catch deer; they fasten a noose (a/ga) on its
horns, hang a stone as large as a ball5 on one of its feet, so as
to keep it from getting far away after it has brought about the
capture of a deer, and set it opposite wild deer when these
are seen. As these (kalahara) deer are singularly combative,
advance to fight is made at once. The two deer strike with
their horns and push one another backwards and forwards,
during which the wild one’s horns become entangled in the net
that is fast to the tame one’s. If the wild one would run away,
the tame one does not go; it is impeded also by the stone on
its foot. People take many deer in this way ; after capture they
tame them and use them in their turn to take others ;° they
also set them to fight at home; the deer fight very well.

There is a smaller deer (£zyzk) on the Hindistan hill-skirts,
as large may-be as the one year’s lamb of the argarghalcha
(Ovis pol).

The gini-cow * is another, a very small one, perhaps as large
as the gachgar (ram) of those countries (Tramontana). Its flesh
is very tender and savoury. f

The monkey (saimin) is another—a Hindistani calls it
bandar. Of this too there are many kinds, one being what people
take to those countries. The jugglers (/#/z) teach them tricks.
This kind is in the mountains of Nir-dara, in the skirt-hills of
Safid-koh neighbouring on Khaibar, and from there downwards
all through Hindistan. It is not found higher up. Its hair is
yellow, its face white, its tail not very long —Another kind, not
found in Bajaur, Sawad and those parts, is much larger than the
one taken to those countries (Tramontana). Its tail is very
long, its hair whitish, its face quite black. It is in the mountains
and jungles of Hindiistan.2—Yet another kind is distinguished
(oula dir), quite black in hair, face and limbs.3

The xawal (nil) + is another. It may be somewhat smaller
than the £zsk. Itclimbs trees. Some call it the sush-t-khirma
(palm-rat). It is thought lucky.

A mouse (T. sichgan) people call galahri (squirrel) is another.
It is just always in trees, running up and down with amazing
alertness and speed.5

' H. gaind. It is 3 feet high (Yule’s H.J. s.. Gynee). Cf. A. A. Blochmann,
p. 149. The ram with which it is compared may be that of Ovzs ammon (Vigné’s

bd an ial Pers. trs. adds :—They call this kind of monkey /angur (baboon, 1.0.
217 f. 192).

3 Here the Pers. trs. adds what Erskine mistakenly attributes to Babur :—People
bring it from several islands.\—They bring yet another kind from several islands,
yellowish-grey in colour like a péstin tin (leather coat of ?; Erskine, skin of the
fig, zz). Its head is broader and its body much larger than those of other monkeys.
It is very fierce and destructive. It is singular guod penis efus semper sit erectus, et
nunguam non ad coitum idoneus [Erskine].

* This name is explained on the margin of the Elph. MS. as ‘‘7as#, which is the
weasel of Tartary” (Erskine). Ads% is an Indian name for the squirrel Sccurus
indicus. The kisk, with which Babur’s z#/ is compared, is explained by de C. as
belette, weasel, and by Steingass as a fur-bearing animal ; the fur-bearing weasel is
(AMustelidae) putorius ermina, the ermine-weasel (Blanford, p. 165), which thus
seems to be Babur’s Aish. The alternative name Babur gives for his ##/, z.c. mish-
#-khiirma, is, in India, that of Sc’urus palmarum, the palm-squirrel (G. of I. i, 227);
this then, it seems that Babur’s mz/ is. (Erskine took mal here to be the mongoose
( Herpestes miingits) (p. 318); and Blanford, perhaps partly on Erskine’s warrant,
gives mitsh-t-khurma as a name of the lesser mangis of Bengal. I gather that the

The peacock (Ar. /aiis) isone. It is a beautifully coloured and
splendid animal. Its form (anzdam) is not equal to its colouring
and beauty. Its body may be as large as the crane’s (¢érna)
but it is not so tall. On the head of both cock and hen are 20
to 30 feathers rising some 2 or 3 inches high. The hen has
neither colour nor beauty. The head of the cock has an
iridescent collar (¢aug siisanz); its neck is of a beautiful blue ;
below the neck, its back is painted in yellow, parrot-green, blue
and violet colours. The flowers? on its back are much the
smaller ; below the back as far as the tail-tips are [larger] flowers
painted in the same colours. The tail of some peacocks grows
to the length of a man’s extended arms.3 It has a small tail
under its flowered feathers, like the tail of other birds; this
ordinary tail and its primaries4 are red. It is in Bajaur and
Sawad and below them ; it is not in Kunur [Kinir] and the
Lamghanat or any place above them. Its flight is feebler than
the pheasant’s (girghawal) ; it cannot do more than make one
or two short flights.5 On account of its feeble flight, it frequents
the hills or jungles, which is curious, since jackals abound in the
jungles it frequents. What damage might these jackals not do
to birds that trail from jungle to jungle, tails as long as a man’s
stretch (gi#/ach)! Hindiistanis call the peacock mor. Its flesh
is lawful food, according to the doctrine of Imam Abi Hanifa ;
it is like that of the partridge and not unsavoury, but is eaten
with instinctive aversion, in the way camel-flesh is. )

The parrot (H. #77) is another. This also is in Bajaur
and countries lower down. It comes into Ningnahar and the

Lamghanat in the heats when mulberries ripen; it is not there
at other times. It is of many, many kinds. One sort is that
which people carry into those (Tramontane) countries. They
make it speak words.—Another sort is smaller ; this also they
make speak words. They call it the jungle-parrot. It is
numerous in Bajaur, Sawad and that neighbourhood, so much
so that 5 or 60co fly in one flock (4haz/). Between it and the
one first-named the difference is in bulk ; in colouring they are
just one and the same.—Another sort is still smaller than the
jungle-parrot. Its head is quite red, the top of its wings (ze. the
primaries) is red also ; the tip of its tail for two hands’-thickness
is lustrous.1 The head of some parrots of this kind is iridescent
(stisanz). It does not become a talker. People call it the
Kashmir parrot.—Another sort is rather smaller than the jungle-
parrot ; its beak is black ; round its neck is a wide black collar ;
its primaries are red. It is an excellent learner of words.—We
used to think that whatever a parrot or a sharak (mina) might say
of words people had taught it, it could not speak of any matter
out of its own head. At this juncture? one of my immediate
servants Abi’l-qasim /alair, reported a singular thing to me.
A parrot of this sort whose cage must have been covered up,
said, “ Uncover my face; I am stifling.” And another time
when palki bearers sat down to take breath, this parrot,
presumably on hearing wayfarers pass by, said, “ Men are going
past, are you not going on?” Let credit rest with the narrator,3
but never-the-less, so long as a person has not heard with his
own ears, he may not believe !—Another kind is of a beautiful
full red ; it has other colours also, but, as nothing is distinctly
remembered about them, no description is made. It is a very
beautiful bird, both in colour and form. People are understood
to make this also speak words.+ Its defect is a most unpleasant,
sharp voice, like the drawing of broken china on a copper plate.5

The (P.) sharak* is another. It is numerous in the Lamghanat
and abounds lower down, all over Hindustan. Like the parrot,
it is of many kinds.—The kind that is numerous in the Lam-
ghanat has a black head ; its primaries (gaat) are spotted, its
body rather larger and thicker? than that of the (T.) chighar-
chiig3 People teach it to speak words.—Another kind they
call p:ndawali+ ; they bring it from Bengal ; it is black all
over and of much greater bulk than the skdrak (here, house-
mina). Its bill and foot are yellow and on each ear are
yellow wattles which hang down and have a bad appearance.5
It learns to speak well and clearly—Another kind of shkarak
is slenderer than the last and is red round the eyes. It
does not learn to speak. People call it the wood-shdrak.®
Again, at the time when (934 AH.) I had made a bridge over
Gang (Ganges), crossed it, and put my adversaries to flight,
a kind of sha@rak was seen, in the neighbourhood of Laknau
and Aid (Oude), for the first time, which had a white breast,
piebald head, and black back. This kind does not learn to

speak.7

® The birds Babur classes under the name sharak seem to include what Oates and
Blanford (whom I follow as they give the results of earlier workers) class under
Sturnus, Eulabes and Calornis, starling, grackle and mina, and tree-stare (Fauna
of British India, Oates, vols. i and ii, Blanford, vols. iii and iv).

3 E. D. Ross’s Polyglot List of Birds, p. 314, Chighir-chig, Northern swallow ;
Elph. MS. f. 2304 interlined 727 (Steingass lark). The description of the bird allows
it to be Sturnus humit, the Himalayan starling (Oates, i, 520).

4 Elph. and Hai. MSS. (Sans. and Bengali) p:ndai ; two good MSS. of the
Pers. trs. (1.0. 217 and 218) fp:ndawali; Ilminsky (p. 361) mina; Erskine
(AMems. p. 319) pinda@welz, but without his customary translation of an Indian name.
The three forms shewn above can all mean ‘“‘ having protuberance or lump” (pizda)
and refer to the bird’s wattle. But the word of the presumably well-informed
scribes of I.O. 217 and 218 can refer to the bird’s sagacity in speech and be panda-
wali, possessed of wisdom. With the same spelling, the word can translate into
the epithet ve//g’osa, given to the wattled mina by Linneus. This epithet
Mr. Leonard Wray informs me has been explained to him as due to the frequenting
of temples by the birds; and that in Malaya they are found living in cotes near
Chinese temples.—An alternative name (one also connecting with redigtosa) allowed
by the form of the word is imda-wali. H. binda is a mark on the forehead, made
as a preparative to devotion by Hindis, or in Sans. and Bengali, is the spot of paint
made on an elephant’s trunk; the meaning would thus be ‘‘having a mark”.

that people call it mina.

The Zija* is another, This bird they call (Ar.) i-galamun
(chameleon) because, between head and tail, it has five or six
changing colours, resplendent (darraq) like a pigeon’s throat.
It is about as large as the £adg-z-dari? and seems to be the
kabg-i-dari of Hindistan. As the kadg-c-dari moves (yirir)
on the heads (4u/ah) of mountains, so does this. It is in the
Nijr-ai_ mountains of the countries of Kabul, and in the
mountains lower down but it is not found higher up. People
tell this wonderful thing about it:—When the birds, at the
onset of winter, descend to the hill-skirts, if they come over
a vineyard, they can fly no further and are taken. God knows
the truth! The flesh of this bird is very savoury.

The partridge (durra7)3 is another. This is not peculiar to
Hindistan but is also in the Gavm-sir countries+; as however
some kinds are only in Hindiistan, particulars of them are given
here. The durraj (Francolinus vulgaris) may be of the same
bulk as the £2#/zk 5; the cock’s back is the colour of the hen-
pheasant (girghawal-ning mada-si); its throat and breast are
black, with quite white spots. A red line comes down on both
sides of both eyes.7_ It is named from its cry ® which is some-
thing like Shr daram shakrak® It pronounces shzr short ;
daram shakrak it says distinctly. Astarabad partridges are said
to cry Bat mini titilar (Quick! they have caught me). The
partridge of Arabia and those parts is understood to cry, B77

shakar tadawm al ni‘am (with sugar pleasure endures)! The
hen-bird has the colour of the young pheasant. These birds
are found below Nijr-atii—Another kind is called kamjal. Its
bulk may be that of the one already described. Its voice is
very like that of the #z#/zk but much shriller. There is little
difference in colour between the cock and hen. It is found in
Parashawar, Hashnagar and countries lower down, but not
higher up.

The p()ul-patkar* is another. Its size may be that of the
kabg-t-dari ; its shape is that of the house-cock, its colour that
of the hen. From forehead (¢#magh) to throat it is of a beautiful
colour, quite red. It is in the Hindistan mountains.

The wild-fowl (sahrai-taiigh)? is another. It flies like a
pheasant, and is not of all colours as house-fowl are. It is in
the mountains of Bajaur and lower down, but not higher up.

The chélsz (or jélsz) 3 is another. In bulk it equals the A(A)z/-
patkar but the latter has the finer colouring. It is in the
mountains of Bajaur.

The sham‘ is another. It is about as large as a house-fowl ;
its colour is unique (ghazr mukarrar)5 It also is in the mountains
of Bajaur.

The quail (P.d%dana)is another. It is not peculiar to Hindustan
but four or five kinds are so.—One is that which goes to our
countries (Tramontana), larger and more spreading than the
(Hindistan) quail..—Another kind 7 is smaller than the one first
named. Its primaries and tail are reddish. It flies in flocks
like the chir (Phastanus Wallichit).—Another kind is smaller
than that which goes to our countries and is darker on throat

* Flower-faced, Trapogon melanocephala, the horned (sizg) -monal. _ It is described
by Jahangir (AZemozrs, R. and B., ii, 220) under the names [H. and P.] phitl-paikar
and Kashmiri, sov/i.

? Gallus sonneratit, the grey jungle-fowl.

3 Perhaps Bambusicola fytchiz, the western bambu-partridge. For chil see E. D.
Ross, Jc. No. 127.

4 Jahangir (/.c.) describes, under the Kashmiri name fa, what may be this bird.
It seems to be Gallus ferrugineus, the red jungle-fow! (Blanford, iv, 75).

5 Jahangir helps to identify the bird by mentioning its elongated tail-feathers,—
seasonal only.

© The migrant quail will be Coturnix communis, the grey quail, 8 inches long ;
sen it is compared with seems likely to be the bush-quail, which is non-migrant and
shorter.

and breast.'—Another kind goes in small numbers to Kabul ;
it is very small, perhaps a little larger than the yellow wag-tail
(garcha)*; they call it gératé in Kabul.

The Indian bustard (P. #Aarcha@l)3 is another. It is about as
large as the(T.)¢aghdag (Otzs tarda, the great bustard), and seems
to be the t#ghdag of Hindistan.4 Its flesh is delicious ; of some
birds the leg is good, of others, the wing ; of the bustard all the
meat is delicious and excellent.

The florican (P. charz)5 is another. It is rather less than the
tighdirvi (houbara) ©; the cock’s back is like the caghdiri’s, and
its breast is black. The hen is of one colour.

The Hindistan sand-grouse (T. daghri-gara)7 is another. It is
smaller and slenderer than the daghri-qgara | Pterocles arenarius]
of those countries (Tramontana). Also its cry is sharper.

Of the birds that frequent water and the banks of rivers, one
is the ding an animal of great bulk, each wing measuring
a gitlach (fathom). It has no plumage (¢#gZ) on head or neck ;
a thing like a bag hangs from its neck; its back is black; its
breast is white. It goes sometimes to Kabul ; one year people
brought one they had caught. It became very tame; if meat

* Perhaps Coturnix coromandelica, the black-breasted or rain quail, 7 inches long.

? Perhaps Motactlla cttreola, a yellow wag-tail which summers in Central Asia
(Oates, ii, 298). If so, its Kabul name may refer to its flashing colour. Cf. E. D.
Ross, /.c, No. 301; de Courteille’s Dzctionary which gives garcha, wag-tail, and
Zenker’s which fixes the colour.

3 Eupodotr's edwardstz ; Turki, tughdar or tighdiri.

4 Erskine noting (Mems. p. 321), that the bustard is common in the Dakkan where
it is bigger than a turkey, says it is called ¢a#ghdar and suggests that this is a corruption
of tiighdag. The uses of both words are shewn by Babur, here, and in the next
following, account of the charz. Cf. G. of I. i, 260 and E. D. Ross dc. Nos. 36, 40.

5 Sypheotis bengalensis and S. aurita, which are both smaller than Ofts houbara
(<aghdtri). In Hindustan S. aurita is known as 4h which name is the nearest
approach I have found to Babur’s [/#a] likha.

© Jerdon mentions (ii, 615) that this bird is common in Afghanistan and there
called dugdaor (tighdar, tighdiri).

7 Cf. Appendix B, since I wrote which, further information has made it fairly safe
to say that the Hindistin daghri-gara is Pterocles exustus, the common sand-
grouse and that the one of f. 494 is Perocles arenarius, the larger or black-bellied
sand-grouse. P. exustus is said by Yule (H. J. s.2. Rock-pigeon) to have been
miscalled rock-pigeon by Anglo-Indians, perhaps because its flight resembles the
pigeon’s. This accounts for Erskine’s rendering (p. 321) baghri-garé here by rock-
pigeon.

8 Leptoptilus dubtus, Hind. hargila. indistanis call it pir-t-ding (Erskine) and
peda dhauk (Blanford), both names referring, perhaps, to its pouch. It is the
adjutant of Anglo-India. Cf. f. 235.

were thrown to it, it never failed to catch it in its bill. Once it
swallowed a six-nailed shoe, another time a whole fowl, wings
and feathers, all right down.

The s@ras (Grus antigone) is another. Turks in Hindiistan
call it ¢iva-tirna (camel-crane). It may be smaller than the
ding but its neck is rather longer. Its head is quite red.t People
keep this bird at their houses ; it becomes very tame.

The manek? is another. In stature it approaches the séras,
but its bulk is less. It resembles the /ag-lag (Czconza alba, the
white stork) but is much larger ; its bill is larger and is black.
Its head is iridescent, its neck white, its wings partly-coloured ;
the tips and border-feathers and under parts of the wings are
white, their middle black.

Another stork (dag-dag) has a white neck and all other parts
black. It goes to those countries (Tramontana). It is rather
smaller than the /ag-lag (Czconda alba). A Hindistani calls it
yak-rang (one colour ?).

Another stork in colour and shape is exactly like the storks
that go to those countries. Its bill is blacker and its bulk much
less than the dag-/ag’s (Ciconia alba).3

Another bird resembles the grey heron (a#gar) and the /ag-
lag ; but its bill is longer than the heron’s and its body smaller
than the white stork’s (/ag-/ag).

Another is the large duzak4 (black ibis). In bulk it may
equal the buzzard (Turki, sav). The back of its wings is white.
It has a loud cry. ;

The white duzak5 is another. Its head and bill are black.

® only when young (Blanford, ii, 188).

2 Elph. MS. mank:sa or mankia; Wai. MS. m:nk. Haughton’s Bengali
Dictionary gives two forms of the name mdnek-jur and manak-yoi. It is Dissura
episcopus, the white-necked stork (Blanford iv, 370, who gives manik-jor amongst its
Indian names). Jerdon classes it (ii, 737) as Ciconta leucocephala. It is the beef-
steak bird of Anglo-India.

3 Ciconia nigra (Blanford, iv, 369).

4 Under the Hindiistani form, ézza, of Persian zak the birds Babur mentions as
buzak can be identified. The large one is Jnocotis papillosus, bitza, kala biza, black
curlew, king-curlew. The bird it equals in size is a buzzard, Turki s@v (not Persian
sar, starling). The king-curlew has a large white patch on the inner lesser and
marginal coverts of its wings (Blanford, iv, 303). This agrees with Babur’s statement
—. the wings of the large duzak. Its length is 27 inches, while the starling’s is
93 inches.

It is much larger than the one that goes to those countries,’ but
smaller than the Hindustan duzak.?

The gharm-pai 3 (spotted-billed duck) is another. It is larger
than the sana burchin4 (mallard). The drake and duck are of
one colour. It is in Hashnagar at all seasons, sometimes it goes
into the Lamghanat. Its flesh is very savoury.

The shah-murgh (Sarcidiornis melanonotus,comb duck or nukta)
is another. It may bea little smaller than a goose. It has a
swelling on its bill; its back is black; its flesh is excellent eating.

The summaj is another. It is about as large as the burgut
(Aquila chrysaetus, the golden eagle).

The (T.) a/a-gargha of Hindistan is another (Corvus cornix,
the pied crow). This is slenderer and smaller than the @/7-
gargha of those countries (Tramontana). Its neck is partly
white.

Another Hindistan bird resembles the crow (T. garcha,
C. splendens) and the magpie (Ar. ‘agga). In the Lamghanat
people call it the jungle-bird (P. murgh-tjangal)5 Its head
and breast are black ; its wings and tail reddish; its eye quite
red. Having a feeble flight, it does not come out of the jungle,
whence its name.

The great bat (P. skapara)® is another. People call it (Hindi)
chumgadur. \t is about as large as the owl (T. yapalag, Otus
brachyotus), and has a head like a puppy’s. When it is thinking
of lodging for the night on a tree, it takes hold of a branch, turns
head-downwards, and so remains. It has much singularity.

The magpie (Ar. ‘agga) is another. People call it (H.?) mata
(Dendrocitta rufa, the Indian tree-pie). It may be somewhat

* Perhaps, Plegadis falcinellus, the glossy ibis, which in most parts of India is
a winter visitor. Its length is 25 inches.

* Erskine suggests that this is Platalea leucoredia, the chamach-biiza, spoon-bill.
It is 33 inches long.

3 Anas poecilorhyncha. The Hai. MS. writes gharm-pai, and this is the Indian
name given by Blanford (iv, 437).

“ Anas boschas. Dr. Ross notes (No. 147), from the Sanglakh, that sana is the
drake, dé#rchin, the duck and that it is common in China to call a certain variety of
bird by the combined sex-names. Something like this is shewn by the uses of dagha
and maral g.v. Index.

5 Centropus rufipennis, the common coucal (Yule’s H.J. s.2. Crow-pheasant) ;
H. makokha, Cuculus castaneus (Buchanan, quoted by Forbes).

Pteropus edwardsit, the flying-fox. The inclusion of the bat here amongst birds,
may be a clerical accident, since on f.136 a flying-fox is not written of as a bird.

less than the ‘agga (Pica rustica), which moreover is pied black
and white, while the a/d is pied brown and black.”

Another is a small bird, perhaps of the size of the(T.) sandilach?
It is of a beautiful red with a little black on its wings.

The archa3 is another ; it is after the fashion of a swallow
(T. garliighach), but much larger and quite black.

The Rail + (Eudynamys orientalis, the koel) is another. It may
be as large as the crow (P. s@g) but is much slenderer. It has
a kind of song and is understood to be the bulbul of Hindistan.
Its honour with Hindistanis is as great as is the bulbul’s. It
always stays in closely-wooded gardens.

Another bird is after the fashion of the (Ar.) shzgarrak (Cissa
chinensis, the green-magpie). It clings to trees, is perhaps as
large as the green-magpie, and is parrot-green (Gecznus striolatus,
the little green-woodpecker ?).

(2. Fauna of Hindistan :— Aquatic animals.)

One is the water-tiger (P. shir-abi, Crocodilus palustris)5 This
is in the standing-waters. It is like a lizard (T. gilds)® People
say it carries off men and even buffaloes.

t Babur here uses what is both the Kabul and Andijan name for the magpie,
Ar. ‘agga (Oates, i, 31 and Scully’s Voc.), instead of T. sdéghiaghan or P. dam-sicha
(tail-wagger).

2 The Pers. trs. writes sandilach mamila, mamila@ being Arabic for wag-tail.
De Courteille’s Dictionary describes the sdzdildch as small and having a long tail,
the cock-bird green, the hen, yellow. The wag-tail suiting this in colouring is
Motacilla borealis (Oates, ii, 294; syn. Budytes viridis, the green wag-tail); this, as
a migrant, serves to compare with the Indian ‘‘ little bird”, which seems likely to be
a red-start.

3 This word may represent Scully’s &¢rzch and be the Turki name for a swift,
perhaps Cypselus affints.

4 This name is taken from its cry during the breeding season (Yule’s H.J.
s.z. Koel). '

5 Babur’s distinction between the three crocodiles he mentions seems to be that
of names he heard, shir-dbi, siyah-sa@r, and gharial.

® In this passage my husband finds the explanation of two somewhat vague
statements of later date, one made by Abii’l-fazl (A. A. Blochmann, p. 65) that
Akbar called the 4z/as (cherry) the shah-alu (king-plum), the other by Jahangir that
this change was made because 4i/a@s means lizard ( Jahangir’s Memorrs, R. & B. i, 116).
What Akbar did is shewn by Babur ; it was to reject the Perstan name Zi/as, cherry,
because it closely resembled Zurhi gilas, lizard. There is a lizard Stellio Lehmanni
of Transoxiana with which Babur may well have compared the crocodile’s appearance
(Schuyler’s Zzrkzstaz, i, 383). Akbar in Hindiistan may have had Varanus salvator
(6 ft. long) in mind, if indeed he had not the great lizard, a/ /agarto, the alligator
itself in his thought. The name 4i/as evidently was banished only from the Court
circle, since it is still current in Kashmir (Blochmann /.c. p. 616) ; and Speede
(p. 201) gives Zeeras, cherry, as used in India.

Fol. 2814.

502 HINDUSTAN

The (P.) s¢yah-sar (black-head) is another. This also is like
a lizard. It is in all rivers of Hindtistan. One that was taken
and brought in was about 4—5 ga@vi (cir. 13 feet) long and as
thick perhaps asa sheep. It is said to grow still larger. Its
snout is over half a yard long. It has rows of small teeth in its
upper and lower jaws. It comes out of the water and sinks into
the mud (dé¢a).

The (Sans.) g[Z]arial (Gavialus gangeticus) is another.* It is
said to grow large ; many in the army saw it in the Sari (Gogra)
river. It is said to take people ; while we were on that river’s
banks (934-935 A.H.), it took one or two slave-women (dadik),
and it took three or four camp-followers between Ghazipir and
Banaras. In that neighbourhood I saw one but from a distance
only and not quite clearly.

The water-hog (P. khak-abi, Platanista gangetica, the porpoise)
is another. This also is in all Hindiistan rivers. It comes up
suddenly out of the water ; its head appears and disappears ; it
dives again and stays below, shewing its tail. Its snout is as
long as the s¢y@h-sar’s and it has the same rows of small teeth.
Its head and the rest of its body are fish-like. When at play in
the water, it looks like a water-carrier’s bag (s#ashak). Water-
hogs, playing in the Sari, leap right out of the water ; like fish,
they never leave it.

Again there is the kalah (or galah)-fish [daligh].2 Two bones

* This name as now used, is that of the purely fish-eating crocodile. [In the
Turki text Babur’s account of the gharia/ follows that of the porpoise; but it is grouped
here with those of the two other crocodiles. ]

? As the Hai. MS. and also I.O. 216 f. 137 (Pers. trs.) write Aalah (galah)-fish,
this may be a large cray-fish. One called by a name approximating to ga/ah-fish is
found in Malayan waters, viz. the galah-prawn (hadang) (cf. Bengali gila-chingri,
gala-prawn, Haughton). Galak and gii/a may express lament made when the fish is
caught (Haughton pp. 931, 933, 952) ; or if £a/ak be read, this may express scolding.
Two good MSS. of the Wag7‘at-i-baburi (Pers. trs.) write kaka; and their word
cannot but have weight. Erskine reproduces Zaéa but offers no explanation of it,
a failure betokening difficulty in his obtaining one. My husband suggests that aka
may represent a stuttering sound, doing so on the analogy of Vullers’ explanation of
the word,—Vir ridiculus et facetus gui simul balbutiat ; and also he inclines to take
the fish to be a crab (kakra). Possibly 4aka is a popular or vulgar name for a cray-
fish or a crab. Whether the sound is lament, scolding, or stuttering the fisherman
knows! Shaikh Zain enlarges Babur’s notice of this fish; he says the bones are
prolonged (ar awarda) from the ears, that these it agitates at time of capture, making
a noise like the word Zaha by which it is known, that it is two wayad (18 in.) long, its
flesh surprisingly tasty, and that it is very active, leaping a gaz (c?r. a yard) out of the

water when the fisherman’s net is set to take it. For information about the Malayan
fish, I am indebted to Mr. Cecil Wray.

932 AH.—OCT. 18TH 1525 To OCT. 8TH 1526 AD. 503

each about 3 inches (az/zk) long, come out in a line with its ears ;
these it shakes when taken, producing an extraordinary noise,
whence, seemingly, people have called it Aalah [or galah].

The flesh of Hindiistan fishes is very savoury ; they have no
odour (azd@) or tiresomeness.". They are surprisingly active. On
one occasion when people coming, had flung a net across a stream,
leaving its two edges half a yard above the water, most fish passed
by leaping a yard above it. In many rivers are little fish which
fling themselves a yard or more out of the water if there be harsh
noise or sound of feet.

The frogs of Hindistan, though otherwise like those others
(Tramontane), run 6 or 7 yards on the face of the water.”

(2. Vegetable products of Hindistan : Fruits.)

The mango (P. andbah) is one of the fruits peculiar to Hindistan.
Hindistanis pronounce the 4 in its name as though no vowel
followed it (ze. Sans. avd) ;3 this being awkward to utter, some
people call the fruit [P.] zaghzak+ as Khwaja Khusrau does :-—

Naghzak-i ma (var. khwash) naghz-kun-d biustan,

Naghztarin mewa [var. na‘mat)-t-Hindistan.s
Mangoes when good, are very good, but, many as are eaten, few
are first-rate. They are usually plucked unripe and ripened in
the house. Unripe, they make excellent condiments (gé@¢éq), are
good also preserved in syrup.© Taking it altogether, the mango
is the best fruit of Hindiistan. Some so praise it as to give it
preference over all fruits except the musk-melon (T. g@zwzz), but

1 T. gtyinlighi, presumably referring to spines or difficult bones ; T. giz, however,
means a scabbard [Shaw].

? One of the common frogs is a small one which, when alarmed, jumps along the
surface of the water (G. of I. i, 273).

3 Anb and anédah (pronounced amb and anzbah) are now less commonly used names

than a. It is an interesting comment on Babur’s words that Abii’l-fazl spells az,
letter by letter, and says that the 4 is quiescent (4yizz 28 ; for the origin of the word
mango, wéde Yule’s H.J. 5.72.)

4 A corresponding diminutive would be fairling.

_5 The variants, entered in parenthesis, are found in the Bib. Ind. ed. of the

such praise outmatches it. It resembles the 4avdi peach.’ It
ripens in the rains. It is eaten in two ways: one is to squeeze
it toa pulp, make a hole in it, and suck out the juice,—the other,
to peel and eat it like the @rdi peach. Its tree grows very large?
and has a leaf somewhat resembling the peach-tree’s. The
trunk is ill-looking and ill-shaped, but in Bengal and Gujrat is
heard of as growing handsome (£/i6).3

The plantain (Sans. fela, Musa sapientum) is another. An
‘Arab calls it #auz.5 Its tree is not very tall, indeed is not to
be called a tree, since it is something between a grass and a tree.
Its leaf is a little like that of the amdn-gara® but grows about
2 yards (gari) long and nearly one broad. Out of the middle of
its leaves rises, heart-like, a bud which resembles a sheep’s heart.
As each leaf (petal) of this bud expands, there grows at its base
a row of 6 or 7 flowers which become the plantains. These
flowers become visible with the lengthening of the heart-like
shoot and the opening of the petals of the bud. The tree is
understood to flower once only.?7 The fruit has two pleasant
qualities, one that it peels easily, the other that it has neither stone
nor fibre.® It is rather longer and thinner than the egg-plant
(P. badanjan ; Solanum melongena). It is not very sweet ; the
Bengal plantain (ze. chini-champa) is, however, said to be very

* T have learned nothing more definite about the word Aé@raz than that it is the
name of a superior kind of peach (Ghzyasw’l-lughat).

? The preceding sentence is out of place in the Turki text ; it may therefore be
a marginal note, perhaps not made by Babur.

3 This sentence suggests that Babur, writing in Agra or Fathpir did not there see
fine mango-trees.

* See Yule’s H.J. on the plantain, the banana of the West.

5 This word is a descendant of Sanscrit mocha, and parent of musa the botanical
name of the fruit (Yule).

© Shaikh Effendi (Kunos), Zenker and de Courteille say of this only that it is the
name ofa tree. Shaw gives a name that approaches it, érman, a grass, a weed ;
Scully explains this as Artemds’a vulgaris, wormwood, but Roxburgh gives no
Artemisia having a leaf resembling the plantain’s. Scully has avdmadan, unexplained,
which, like amdn-gara, may refer to comfort in shade. Babur’s comparison will be
with something known in Transoxiana. Maize has general resemblance with the
plantain. So too have the names of the plants, since socka and mauz stand for the
plantain and (Hindi) muk@i for maize. These incidental resemblances bear, however
lightly, on the question considered in the Ency. Br. (art. maize) whether maize was
early in Asia or not; some writers hold that it was; if Babur’s amdan-gara@ were
maize, maize will have been familiar in Transoxiana in his day.

7 Abi’l-faz! mentions that the plantain-tree bears no second crop unless cut down
to the stump.

® Babur was fortunate not to have met with a seed-bearing plantain.

sweet. The plantain is a very good-looking tree, its broad,
broad, leaves of beautiful green having an excellent appearance.

The anbli (H. zmli, Tamarindus indica, the tamarind) is
another. By this name (azd/z) people call the khurma-i-hind

(Indian date-tree).' It has finely-cut leaves (leaflets), precisely .

like those of the (T.) did, except that they are not so finely-cut.?
It is a very good-looking tree, giving dense shade. It grows wild
in masses too.

The (Beng.) mahuwa (Bassia latifolia) is another.3 People
call it also (P.) gal-chikan (or chigan, distilling-flower). This also
is a very large tree. Most of the wood in the houses of Hindi-
stanis is from it. Spirit (‘avaq) is distilled from its flowers,* not
only so, but they are dried and eaten like raisins, and from them
thus dried, spirit is also extracted. The dried flowers taste just
like késhmish ;5 they havean ill-flavour. The flowers are not bad
in their natural state®; they are eatable. The mahuwd grows
wild also. Its fruit is tasteless, has rather a large seed with a
thin husk, and from this seed, again,7 oil is extracted.

The mimusops (Sans. £hzrni, Mimusops kaukz) is another. Its
tree, though not very large, isnot small. The fruit is yellow and

* The ripe ‘‘dates” are called P. ¢amar-¢ Hind, whence our tamarind, and
Tamarindus Indica.

2 Sophora alopecurotdes, a leguminous plant (Scully).

3 Abi’l-fazl gives galaunda as the name of the ‘“‘fruit” [ewa],—Forbes, as that
of the fallen flower. Cf. Brandis p. 426 and Yule’s H.J. s.7. Mohwa.

4 Babur seems to say that spirit is extracted from both the fresh and the dried
flowers. The fresh ones are favourite food with deer and jackals ; they have a sweet
spirituous taste. Erskine notes that the spirit made from them was well-known in
Bombay by the name of Moura, or of Parsi-brandy, and that the farm of it was
a considerable article of revenue (p. 325 n.). Roxburgh describes it as strong and
intoxicating (p. 411).

5 This is the name of a green, stoneless grape which when dried, results in a raisin
resembling the sultanas of Europe ( Jahangir’s Memoirs and Yule’s H.J. s.2. ; Griffiths’
Journal of Travel pp. 359, 388).

© Aul, lit. the az of the flower. The Persian translation renders az/ by 6% which
may allow both words to be understood in their (root) sense of dezzg, z.e. natural
state. De Courteille translates by gaazd la fleur est fraiche (ii, 210) ; Erskine took
5% to mean smell (Afemoirs p. 325), but the az/ it translates, does not seem to have
this meaning. For reading ad#/ as ‘“‘the natural state”, there is circumstantial
support in the flower’s being eaten raw (Roxburgh). The annotator of the Elphin-
stone MS. [whose defacement of that Codex has been often mentioned], has added
points and fashdid to the aal-i (7.e. its awl), so as to produce awwali (first, f. 235).
Against this there are the obvious objections that the Persian translation does not
reproduce, and that its 4% does not render awzwali ; also that az/-z is a noun with its
enclitic genitive ya (2).

7 This word seems to be meant to draw attention to the various merits of the
mahuwa tree.

thinner than the red jujube (T. chikda, Eleagnus angustifolia),
It has just the grape’s flavour, but a rather bad after-taste ; it
is not bad, however, and is eatable. The husk of its stone
is thin.

The (Sans.) jaman (Eugenia jambolana)* is another. Its leaf,
except for being thicker and greener, is quite like the willow’s
(T. zal). The tree does not want for beauty. Its fruit is like
a black grape, is sourish, and not very good.

The (H.) hamrak (Beng. kamrunga, Averrhoa carambola) is
another. Its fruit is five-sided, about as large as the ‘azz-ali ?
and some 3 inches long. It ripens to yellow ; gathered unripe,
it is very bitter ; gathered ripe, its bitterness has become sub-
acid, not bad, not wanting in pleasantness.3

The jack-fruit (H. hadhil, B. kanthal, Artocarpus integrifolia)
is another.4 This is a fruit of singular form and flavour ; it looks
like a sheep’s stomach stuffed and made into a haggis (gia) ;5
and it is sickeningly-sweet. Inside it are filbert-like stones ®
which, on the whole, resemble dates, but are round, not long,
and have softer substance; these are eaten. The jack-fruit is
very adhesive ; for this reason people are said to oil mouth and
hands before eating of it. It is heard of also as growing, not
only on the branches of its tree, but on trunk and root too.?7 One
would say that the tree was all hung round with haggises.®

The monkey-jack (H. badhal, B. burhul, Artocarpus lacoocha)
is another. The fruit may be of the size of a quince (var. apple).

' Erskine notes that this is not to be confounded with E. amdz, the rose-apple
(Memoirs p. 325 n.). Cf. Yule’s H.J. 5.2. Jambu.

2 var. ghat-dli, ghab-ali, ghain-alu, shaft-ali. Scully enters ‘aiz-a/i (true-plum?)
unexplained. The damrak fruit is 3 in. long (Brandis) and of the size of a lemon
(Firminger) ; dimensions which make Babur’s 4 ai/zk (hand’s-thickness) a slight excess
only, and which thus allow ai/zé, with its Persion translation, angusht, to be approxi-
mately an inch.

3 Speede, giving the fruit its Sanscrit name amarunga, says it is acid, rather
pleasant, something like an insipid apple ; also that its pretty pink blossoms grow on
the trunk and main branches (i, 211).

4 Cf. Yule’s H.J. 5.7. jack-fruit. In a Calcutta nurseryman’s catalogue of 1914 AD.
three kinds of jack-tree are offered for sale, viz. ‘‘Crispy or Khaja, Soft or Neo,
Rose-scented ” (Seth, Feronia Nursery).

5 The gifa is a sheep’s stomach stuffed with rice, minced meat, and spices, and
boiled as a pudding. The resemblance of the jack, as it hangs on the tree, to the
haggis, is wonderfully complete (Erskine).

© These when roasted have the taste of chestnuts.

7 Firminger (p. 186) describes an ingenious method of training.

Its smell is not bad.* Unripe it is a singularly tasteless and
empty? thing ; when ripe, it is not so bad. It ripens soft, can
be pulled to pieces and eaten anywhere, tastes very much like
a rotten quince, and has an excellent little austere flavour.

The lote-fruit (Sans. der, Zizyphus jujuba) is another. Its
Persian name is understood to be kandr.3 It is of several kinds :
of one the fruit is larger than the plum (@/icha) 4; another is
shaped like the Husaini grape. Most of them are not very good;
we saw one in Bandir (Giialiar) that was really good. The lote-
tree sheds its leaves under the Signs Saur and /auza (Bull and
Twins), burgeons under Savatan and Asad (Crab and Lion) which
are the true rainy-season,—then becoming fresh and green, and
it ripens its fruit under Da/it and Haut (Bucket ze. Aquarius, and
Fish).

The (Sans.) karaiinda (Carissa carandas, the corinda)is another.
It grows in bushes after the fashion of the (T.) chika of our
country,5 but the chzka grows on mountains, the karaiinda on the
plains. In flavour it is like the rhubarb itself, but is sweeter and
less juicy.

The (Sans.) paniyala (Flacourtia cataphracta)7 is another. It
is larger than the plum (d/#cha) and like the red-apple unripe.®
It is a little austere and is good. The tree is taller than the
pomegranate’s; its leaf is like that of the almond-tree but
smaller.

? bush, English bosh (Shaw). The Persian translation inserts no more about this
fruit.

3 Steingass applies this name to the plantain.

4 Erskine notes that ‘‘ this is the bullace-plum, small, not more than twice as large
as the sloe and not so high-flavoured ; it is generally yellow, sometimes red.” Like
Babur, Brandis enumerates several varieties and mentions the seasonal changes of the
tree (p. 170).

5 This will be Kabul, probably, because Transoxiana is written of by Babur
usually, if not invariably, as ‘‘that country”, and because he mentions the chikda
(2.e. chtka?), under its Persian name szmjzd, in his Description of Kabul (f. 1296).

° P. mar manjan, which I take to refer to the viwalar of Kabul. (Cf. f. 1290,

viz. that from it is made a tasty fritter-like dish, resembling a rhubarb-fritter
(Ilminsky, p. 369).

7 People call it (P.) Aa/asa also (Elph. MS. f. 236, marginal note).

very much so, but much inferior to the other (Griffith’s Journal of Travel p. 388).

The (H.) gilar (Ficus glomerata, the clustered fig) * is another.
The fruit grows out of the tree-trunk, resembles the fig (P. awyér),
but is singularly tasteless.

The (Sans.) amla (Phyllanthus emblica, the myrobalan-tree) is
another. This also is a five-sided fruit.2 It looks like the un-
blown cotton-pod. It is an astringent and ill-flavoured thing,
but confiture made of it is not bad. It isa wholesome fruit. Its
tree is of excellent form and has very minute leaves.

The (H.) chérianji (Buchanania latifolia)3 is another. This
tree had been understood to grow in the hills, but I knew later
about it, because there were three or four clumps of it in our
gardens. It is much like the makuwd. Its kernel is not bad,
a thing between the walnut and the almond, not bad! rather
smaller than the pistachio and round ; people put it in custards
(P. palida) and sweetmeats (Ar. alwa).

The date-palm (P. khurmda, Phenix dactylifera) is another.
This is not peculiar to Hindustan, but is here described because
it is not in those countries (Tramontana). It grows in Lamghan
also.4 Its branches (ze. leaves) grow from just one place at its
top; its leaves (z.e. leaflets) grow on both sides of the branches
(midribs) from neck (ddim) to tip; its trunk is rough and ill-
coloured ; its fruit is like a bunch of grapes, but much larger.
People say that the date-palm amongst vegetables resembles an
animal in two respects: one is that, as, if an animal’s head be
cut off, its life is taken, so it is with the date-palm, if its head is
cut off, it dries off; the other is that, as the offspring of animals
is not produced without the male, so too with the date-palm, it
gives no good fruit unless a branch of the male-tree be brought
into touch with the female-tree. The truth of this last matter
is not known (to me). The above-mentioned head of the date-
palm is called its cheese. The tree so grows that where its leaves
come out is cheese-white, the leaves becoming green as they
lengthen. This white part, the so-called cheese, is tolerable
eating, not bad, much like the walnut. People make a wound in

* Its downy fruit grows in bundles from the trunk and large branches (Roxburgh).

2? The reference by “also” (ham) will be to the kamrak (f. 2836), but both
Roxburgh and Brandis say the avz/a is six striated.

; & aural and Bengali name for the chirinji-tree is piyala (Roxburgh p. 363).

the cheese, and into this wound insert a leaf(let), in such a way
that all liquid flowing from the wound runs down it. The tip
of the leaflet is set over the mouth of a pot suspended to the tree
in such a way that it collects whatever liquor is yielded by the
wound. This liquor is rather pleasant if drunk at once; ifdrunk
after two or three days, people say it is quite exhilarating
(hatfiyat). Once when I had gone to visit Bari,? and made an
excursion to the villages on the bank of the Chambal-river, we
met in with people collecting this date-liquor in the valley-bottom.
A good deal was drunk ; no hilarity was felt ; much must be
drunk, seemingly, to produce a little cheer.

The coco-nut palm (P. xargil, Cocos nucifera) is another. An
‘Arab gives it Arabic form 3 and says zavjil ; Hindiistan people
say wa/lir, seemingly by popular error.4 Its fruit is the Hindi-
nut from which black spoons (gar@ gashiig) are made and the
larger ones of which serve for guitar-bodies. The coco-palm has
general resemblance to the date-palm, but has more, and more
glistening leaves. Like the walnut, the coco-nut has a green
outer husk ; but its husk is of fibre on fibre. All ropes for ships
and boats and also cord for sewing boat-seams are heard of as
made from these husks. The nut, when stripped of its husk, near
one end shews a triangle of hollows, two of which are solid, the
third a nothing (d7sh), easily pierced. Before the kernel forms,
there is fluid inside ; people pierce the soft hollow and drink
this ; it tastes like date-palm cheese in solution, and is not bad.

The (Sans.) tar (Borassus flabelliformis, the Palmyra-palm) is
another. Its branches (ze. leaves) also are quite at its top. Just as
with the date-palm, people hang a pot on it, take its juice and
drink it. They call this liquor zarz;5 it is said to be more ex-
hilarating than date liquor. For about a yard along its branches

* The leaflet is rigid enough to serve as a runlet, but soon wears out; for this
reason, the usual practice is to use one of split bamboo.

? This is a famous hunting-ground between Biana and Dhiilpir, Rajpiitana, visited
in 933 AH. (f. 3304). Babur’s great-great-grandson Shah-jahan built a hunting-lodge
there (G. of I.).

3 Hai. MS. mz‘arrab, but the Elph. MS. maghrib, [occidentalizing]. The Hai.
MS. when writing of the orange (7#/ra) also has maghrié. A distinction of locality
may be drawn by maghrib.

5 This name, with its usual form ¢a@di (toddy), is used for the fermented sap of the
date, coco, and mhar palms also (cf. Yule’s H.J. 5.2. toddy).

(ze. leaf-stems) * there are no leaves; above this, at the tip of
the branch (stem), 30 or 40 open out like the spread palm of the
hand, all from one place. These leaves approach a yard in length.
People often write Hindi characters on them after the fashion of
account rolls (daftar yusinliq).

The orange (Ar. n@ranj, Citrus aurantium) and orange-like
fruits are others of Hindiistan.2 Oranges grow well in the
Lamghanat, Bajaur and Sawad. The Lamghanat one is smallish,
has a navel,3 is very agreeable, fragile and juicy. It is not at all
like the orange of Khuradsan and those parts, being so fragile
that many spoil before reaching Kabul from the Lamghanat
which may be 13-14 yighach (65-70 miles), while the Astarabad
orange, by reason of its thick skin and scant juice, carries with
less damage from there to Samarkand, some 270-280 yighach4
The Bajaur orange is about as large as a quince, very juicy and
more acid than other oranges. Khwaja Kalan once said to me,
“We counted the oranges gathered from a single tree of this sort
in Bajaur and it mounted up to 7,000.” It had been always in
my mind that the word z@ranj was an Arabic form ;5 it would
seem to be really so, since every-one in Bajaur and Sawad says
(P.) narang§

* Babur writes of the long leaf-stalk as a branch (sk@2h) ; he also seems to have
taken each spike of the fan-leaf to represent a separate leaf. [For two omissions
from my trs. see Appendix O.]

? Most of the fruits Babur describes as orange-like are named in the following
classified list, taken from Watts’ Economic Products of India :—‘‘ Citrus aurantium,
narangi, sangtara, amrit-phal; C. decumana, fumelo, shaddock, forbidden-fruit,
sada-phal; C, medica proper, ‘urunj, limu; C. medica limonum, jambhira,
karna-nebu,” Under C. aurantium Brandis enters both the sweet and the Seville
oranges (drangi) ; this Babur appears to do also.

3 kindikiik, explained in the Elph. Codex by 2afwar (f. 238). This detail is omitted
by the Persian translation. Firminger’s description (p. 221) of Aurangabad oranges
suggests that they also are navel-oranges. At the present time one of the best
oranges had in England is the navel one of California.

‘ Useful addition is made to earlier notes on the variability of the yighach, a
variability depending on time taken to cover the ground, by the following passage
from Henderson and Hume’s Lahor to Yarkand (p. 120), which shews that even in
the last century the farsang (the P. word used in the Persian translation of the
Babur-nama for T. yighach) was computed by time. ‘‘ All the way from Kargallik
(Qarghaliq) to Yarkand, there were tall wooden mile-posts along the roads, at intervals
of about § miles, or rather one hour’s journey, apart. On a board at the top of each
post, or farsang as it is called, the distances were very legibly written in Turki.”

5 ma‘rib, Elph. MS. magharrib ; (cf. f. 2856 note).

i.e. ndrang (Sans. xdranga) has been changed to xaranj in the ‘Arab mouth.
What is probably one of Humayiin’s notes preserved by the Elph. Codex (f. 238),
appears to say—it is mutilated—that 2@rang has been corrupted into 2aranj.

The lime (B. zm, C. actda) is another. It is very plentiful,
about the size of a hen’s egg, and of the same shape. Ifa person
poisoned drink the water in which its fibres have been boiled,
danger is averted.*

The citron (P. turunj,? C. medica) is another of the fruits
resembling the orange. Bajauris and Sawadis call it da/ang and
hence give the name 4a/ang-marabbé to its marmalade (sarabba)
confiture. In Hindiistan people call the curun7 bajauri3 There
are two kinds of zurunj: one is sweet, flavourless and nauseating,
of no use for eating but with peel that may be good for mar-
malade ; it has the same sickening sweetness as the Lamghanat
turumj ; the other, that of Hindiistan and Bajaur, is acid, quite
deliciously acid, and makes excellent sherbet, well-flavoured, and
wholesome drinking. Its size may be that of the Khusrawi melon;
it has a thick skin, wrinkled and uneven, with one end thinner and
beaked. It is of a deeper yellow than the orange (zaranj). Its
tree has no trunk, is rather low, grows in bushes, and has a larger
leaf than the orange.

The sangtara* is another fruit resembling the orange (aran).

* The Elph. Codex has a note—mutilated in early binding—which is attested by
its scribe as copied from Huméayiin’s hand-writing, and is to the effect that once on
his way from the Hot-bath, he saw people who had taken poison and restored them
by giving lime-juice.

Erskine here notes that the same antidotal quality is ascribed to the citron by
Virgil :-—

Media fert tristes succos. tardumque saporem
Felicis mali, quo non praesentius ullum,
Pocula si quando saevae infecere novercae,
Miscueruntque herbas et non innoxia verba,
Auxilium: venit, ac membris agit atra venena.
Georgics II. v. 126.
Vide Heyne’s note i, 438. .
” a turunj, wrinkled, puckered ; Sans. viyapira and H. bijaura (Ayin 28), seed-
led.

3 Babur may have confused this with H. dzjaurda ; so too appears to have done the
writér (Humayin ?) of a [now mutilated] note in the Elph. Codex (f. 238), which
seems to say that the fruit or its name went from Bajaur to Hindistan. Is the
country of Bajaur so-named from its indigenous orange (vivapiira, whence bzjaura)?
The name occurs also north of Kangra.

4 Of this name variants are numerous, santra, santhara, samtara, etc. Watts
classes it asa C. aurantium ; Erskine makes it the common sweet orange ; Firminger,
quoting Ross (p. 221) writes that, as grown in the Nagpur gardens it is one of the finest
Indian oranges, with rind thin, smooth and close. The Emperor Muhammad Shah
1s said to have altered its name to rang-¢ara because of its fine colour (vag) (Forbes).
Speede (ii, 109) gives both names. As to the meaning and origin of the name savfara
or santra, so suggestive of Cintra, the Portuguese home of a similar orange, it may be
said that it looks like a hill-name used in N.E. India, for there is a village in the

It is like the citron (aun) in colour and form, but has both
ends of its skin level ;* also it is not rough and is somewhat the
smaller fruit. Its tree is large, as large as the apricot (airzgq),
with a leaf like the orange’s. It is a deliciously acid fruit, making
a very pleasant and wholesome sherbet. Like the lime it is a
powerful stomachic, but not weakening like the orange (za@ram).

The large lime which they call (H.) ga/-gaf? in Hindustan is
another fruit resembling the orange. It has the shape of a goose’s
egg, but unlike that egg, does not taper to the ends. Its skin is
smooth like the sangtdra’s ; it is remarkably juicy.

The (H.) jandiri lime3 is another orange-like fruit. It is orange-
shaped and, though yellow, not orange-yellow. It smells like the
citron (¢vunj) ; it too is deliciously acid.

The (Sans.) sada-fal ( phal) + is another orange-like fruit. This
is pear-shaped, colours like the quince, ripens sweet, but not to
the sickly-sweetness of the orange (#dvany).

The amrd-fal (sic. Hai. MS.—Sans. amrit-phal)5 is another
orange-like fruit.

The lemon (H. £arnda, C. imonum) is another fruit resembling
the orange (~dranj); it may beas large as the ga/-gal and is also
acid.

The (Sans.) amal-bid® is another fruit resembling the orange.

Bhutan Hills, (Western Duars) known from its orange groves as Santra-bari, Abode
ofthe orange. To this (mentioned already as my husband’s suggestion in Mr. Crooke’s
ed. of Yule’s H.J.) support is given by the item ‘‘Suntura, famous Nipal variety”,
entered in Seth’s Nursery-list of 1914 (Feronia Nurseries, Calcutta). Light on the
question of origin could be thrown, no doubt, by those acquainted with the dialects
of the hill-tract concerned.

* This refers, presumably, to the absence of the beak characteristic of all citrons.

2 melter, from the Sans. root ga/, which provides the names of several lemons by
reason of their solvent quality, specified by Babur (##fra) of the amal-bid. Erskine
notes that in his day the ga/-ga/ was known as hilmek (galmak ?).

3 Sans. jambira, H. jambir, classed by Abi’l-fazl as one of the somewhat sour
fruits and by Watts as Citrus medica limonum. ;

* Watts, C. decumana, the shaddock or pumelo; Firminger (p. 223) has C. decumana
pyriformis suiting Babur’s ‘‘ pear-shaped”. What Babur compared it with will be
the Transoxanian pear and quince (/. amrid and 67h?) and not the Indian guava and
Bengal quince (. amrid and H. bael).

5 The Turki text writes amrd, Watts classes the amrzt-phal as a C. aurantium.
This supports Erskine’s suggestion that it is the mandarin-orange. Humayin

After three years (in Hindiistan), it was first seen to-day.t They
say a needle melts away if put inside it,? either from its acidity
or some other property. It is as acid, perhaps, as the citron and
lemon (tarunj and limit).3

(m. Vegetable products of Hindistan :—Flowers.)

In Hindiistan there is great variety of flowers. One is the (D.)
jastin (Hibiscus rosa sinensis), which some Hindistanis call
(Hindi) gazhal4+ *It is not a grass (gzya@h) ; its tree (is in stems
like the bush of the red-rose ; it) is rather taller than the bush
of the red-rose.5* The flower of the asd is fuller in colour than
that of the pomegranate, and may be of the size of the red-rose,
but, the red-rose, when its bud has grown, opens simply, whereas,
when the 7@stim-bud opens, a stem on which other petals grow,
is seen like a heart amongst its expanded petals. Though the
two are parts of the one flower, yet the outcome of the lengthening
and thinning of that stem-like heart of the first-opened petals
gives the semblance of two flowers.© It is not a common matter.
The beautifully coloured flowers look very well on the tree, but

Babur is writing of a fruit like an orange, the cane that bears an acid fruit, Calamus
rotang, can be left aside in favour of Cztrus medica acidissima. Of this fruit the
solvent property Babur mentions, as well as the commonly-known service in cleansing
metal, link it, by these uses, with the willow and suggest a ground for understanding,
as Erskine did, that amza/-bid meant acid-willow ; for willow-wood is used to rub rust
off metal.

* This statement shows that Babur was writing the Description of Hindustan in
935 AH. (1528-9 ap.), which is the date given for it by Shaikh Zain.

? This story of the needle is believed in India of all the citron kind, which are hence

3 Erskine here quotes information from Abi’l-fazl (Ayin 28) about Akbar’s
encouragement of the cultivation of fruits. ;

4 Hindustani (Urdu) garha/. Many varieties of Hibiscus (syn. Althea) grow in
India ; some thrive in Surrey gardens ; the jasiiz by name and colour can be taken
as what is known in Malayan, Tamil, etc., as the shoe-flower, from its use in darkening
leather (Yule’s H.J.).

5 I surmise that what I have placed between asterisks here belongs to the next-
following plant, the oleander. For though the branches of the asin grow vertically,
the bush isa dense mass upon one stout trunk, or stout short stem. The words placed
in parenthesis above are not with the Haidarabad but are with the Elphinstone Codex.
There would seem to have been a scribe’s skip from one ‘‘ rose” to the other. As
has been shewn repeatedly, this part of the Babur-nama has been much annotated; in
the Elph. Codex, where only most of the notes are preserved, some are entered by
the scribe pell-mell into Babur’s text. The present instance may be a case of a
marginal note, added to the text in a wrong place.

The peduncle supporting the plume of medial petals is clearly seen only when the
| aera first. The plumed Hibiscus is found in florists’ catalogues described as

louble ”’.

they do not last long; they fade in just one day. The jasiz
blossoms very well through the four months of the rains ; it seems
indeed to flower all through the year ; with this profusion, how-
ever, it gives no perfume.

The (H.) anir (Nerium odorum, the oleander)* is another. It
grows both red and white. Like the peach-flower, it is five
petalled. It is like the peach-bloom (in colour ?), but opens 14
or 15 flowers from one place, so that seen from a distance, they
look like one great flower. The oleander-bush is taller than the
rose-bush. The red oleander has a sort of scent, faint and agree-
able. (Like the 7@sziz,) it also blooms well and profusely in the
rains, and it also is had through most of the year.

The (H.) (£éira) (Pandanus odoratissimus, the screw-pine) is
another.? It hasa very agreeable perfume.3 Musk has the defect
of being dry ; this may be called moist musk—a very agreeable
perfume. The tree’s singular appearance notwithstanding, it has
flowers perhaps 14 to 2 garish (13} to 18 inches) long. It has
long leaves having the character of the reed (P.) gharau + and
having spines. Of these leaves, while pressed together bud-like,
the outer ones are the greener and more spiny ; the inner ones
are soft and white. In amongst these inner leaves grow things
like what belongs to the middle of a flower, and from these
things comes the excellent perfume. When the tree first comes
up not yet shewing any trunk, it is like the bush (dda) of the
male-reed,S but with wider and more spiny leaves. What serves
it for a trunk is very shapeless, its roots remaining shewn.

* This Anglo-Indians call also rose-bay. A Persian name appears to be zahr-giyah,
poison-grass, which makes it the more probable that the doubtful passage in the
previous description of the jasa# belongs to the rod-like oleander, known as the
poison-grass. The oleander is common in river-beds over much country known to
Babur, outside India.

? Roxburgh gives a full and interesting account of this tree.

3 Here the Elph. Codex, only, has the (seeming) note, ‘‘An ‘Arab calls it agi”
(or £awz). This fills out Steingass’ part-explanation of 4a@wi, ‘‘the blossom of the
fragrant palm-tree, arma¢” (p. 1010), and of avmaf, ‘‘a kind of date-tree with
a fragrant blossom” (p. 39), by making arma¢ and Zawi seem to be the Pandanus
and its flower.

_ * Calamus scriptorius (Vullers ii, 607. H.B.). Abii’]-fazl compares the leaves to
jawari, the great millet (Forbes); Blochmann (A. A. p. 83) translates jawart by
maize ( juward, Forbes).

5 T. atrkak-gumish, a name Scully enters unexplained. Under ga#mish (reed) he
enters drundo madagascarensis ; Babur’s comparison will be with some Transoxanian
Arundo or Calamus, presumably.

The (P.) ya@sman (jasmine) is another ; the white they call (B.)
champa.* It is larger and more strongly scented than our
yasman-flower.

(n. Seasons of the year.)

Again:—whereas there are four seasons in those countries,?
there are three in Hindistan, namely, four months are summer ;
four are the rains; four are winter. The beginning of their
months is from the welcome of the crescent-moons.3 Every
three years they add a month to the year ; if one had been added

to the rainy season, the next is added, three years later, to the

winter months, the next, in the same way, to the hot months.
This is their mode of intercalation.4 (Chait, Baisakh, Jeth and
Asarh) are the hot months, corresponding with the Fish, (Ram,
Bull and Twins ; Sdwan, Bhadon, Ki,ar and Katzk) are the
rainy months, corresponding with the Crab, (Lion, Virgin and
Balance ; Aghan, Pis, Magh and Phalgun) are the cold months,
corresponding with the Scorpion, (Archer, Capricorn, and Bucket
or Aquarius).

The people of Hind, having thus divided the year into three
seasons of four months each, divide each of those seasons by
taking from each, the two months of the force of the heat, rain,°
and cold. Of the hot months the last two, ze. Jefh and Asarh
are the force of the heat ; of the rainy months, the first two, ze.
Sawan and Bhddon are the force of the rains ; of the cold season,
the middle two, ze. Pas and Mdgh are the force of the cold. By
this classification there are six seasons in Hindiistan.

* Champa seems to have been Babur’s word (Elph. and Hai. MSS.), but is the
(B.) name for Adichelia champaka ; the Pers, translation corrects it by (B.) chambeli,
(yasman, jasmine).

? Here, ‘‘ outside India” will be meant, where Hindi rules do not prevail.

3 Hind ailari-ning tbtida-st hilal ailar-ning istigbal-din dir. The use here of
tstigbal, welcome, attracts attention ; does it allude to the universal welcome of lighter
nights? or is it reminiscent of Muhammadan welcome to the Moon’s crescent in
Shawwal ?

4 For an exact statement of the intercalary months wéde Cunningham’s /zdian Eras,
p. 91. In my next sentence (szfra) the parenthesis-marks indicate blanks left on the
page of the Hai. MS. as though waiting for information. These and other similar
blanks make for the opinion that the Hai. Codex is a direct copy of Babur’s draft
manuscript.

5 The sextuple division (72¢w) of the year is referred to on f. 284, where the Signs
Crab and Lion are called the season of the true Rains.

(0. Days of the week.)

To the days also they have given names :—? (Sanichar is
Saturday ; Radi-bar is Sunday ; Som-war is Monday ; Alangal-
war is Tuesday: Budh-bar is Wednesday; Brihaspat-bar is
Thursday ; Shukr-bar is Friday).

(p. Divisions of time.)

As in our countries what is known by the (Turki) term icha-
gundiz (a day-and-night, nycthemeron) is divided into 24 parts,
each called an hour (Ar. sé@‘a¢), and the hour is divided into 60
parts, each called a minute (Ar. dagiga), so that a day-and-night

(Author's note on the dagiga.) The dagiga is about as long as six repetitions
of the Fatiza with the Bismz/lzh, so that a day-and-night is as long as 8640
repetitions of the /a@téha with the Bismillah.

consists of 1440 minutes,—so the people of Hind divide the night-
and-day into 60 parts, each called a (S.) g’hari.? They also
divide the night into four and the day into four, calling each part
a (S.) pahr (watch) which in Persian is a fas. A watch and
watchman (fas u pasban) had been heard about (by us) in those
countries (Transoxania), but without these particulars. Agreeing
with the division into watches, a body of g’haridlis3 is chosen
and appointed in all considerable towns of Hindistan. They
cast a broad brass (plate-) thing,+ perhaps as large as a tray
(tabaq) and about two hands’-thickness ; this they calla g’harial
and hang up in a high place (bir buland yir-da). Also they have
a vessel perforated at the bottom like an hour-cup 5 and filling

* Babur appears not to have entered either the Hindi or the Persian names of the
week :—the Hai. MS. has a blank space; the Elph. MS. had the Persian names
only, and Hindi ones have been written in above these ; Kehr has the Persian ones
only ; Ilminsky has added the Hindi ones. (The spelling of the Hindi names, in my
translation, is copied from Forbes’ Dictionary. )

* The Hai. MS. writes gari and garia@/. The word now stands for the hour of
60 minutes.
on fa — The name is applied also to an alligator Lacertus sangeticus

orbes).

‘4 There is some confusion in the text here, the Hai. MS. reading dcrinj-din tishi (?)
nima guiubtirlar—the Elph. MS. (f. 2406) biring-din bir yassit nima guinbtirlar.
The Persian translation, being based on the text of the Elphinstone Codex reads az
biring yak chiz pahni rekhia and. The word ¢ishi of the Hai. MS. may represent
tasht plate or yassi, broad ; against the latter however there is the sentence that follows
and gives the size.

5 Here again the wording of the Hai. MS. is not clear; the sense however is
obvious. Concerning the clepsydra véde A. A. Jarrett, ii, 15 and notes; Smith’s
Dictionary of Antiquities; Yule’s H.J. s.x. Ghurry.

in one @’hari (ze. 24 minutes). The g’harialis put this into water
and wait till it fills. For example, they will put the perforated
cup into water at day-birth ; when it fills the first time, they strike
the gong once with their mallets ; when a second time, twice, and
so on till the end of the watch. They announce the end of a
watch by several rapid blows of their mallets. After these they
pause ; then strike once more, if the first day-watch has ended,
twice if the second, three times if the third, and four times if the
fourth. After the fourth day-watch, when the night-watches
begin, these are gone through in the same way. It used to be
the rule to beat the sign of a watch only when the watch ended;
so that sleepers chancing to wake in the night and hear the sound
of a third or fourth g’Zarz, would not know whether it was of the
second or third night-watch. I therefore ordered that at night
or on a cloudy day the sign of the watch should be struck after
that of the g’/ari, for example, that after striking the third ¢’harz
of the first night-watch, the g’aridlis were to pause and then
strike the sign of the watch, in order to make it known that this
third havi was of the first night-watch,—and that after striking
four g’haris of the third night-watch, they should pause and then
strike the sign of the third watch, in order to make it known that
this fourth g’haré was of the third night-watch. It did very well ;
anyone happening to wake in the night and hear the gong, would
know what g’arz of what watch of night it was.

Again, they divide the g’ari into 60 parts, each part being
called a fal ;* by this each night-and-day will consist of 3,500 pads.

(Author's note on the pal.) They say the length of a fal is the shutting and
opening of the eyelids 60 times, which in a night-and-day would be 216,000
shuttings and openings of the eyes. Experiment shews that a fal is about
equal to 8 repetitions of the Qul-huwa-allah? and Bismillah ; this would be
28,000 repetitions in a night-and-day.

(g. Measures.)

The people of Hind have also well-arranged measures :—3
8 ratis = 1 masha; 4 masha = 1 tank = 32 ratis; 5 masha =
I mzsgal= 40 ratis ; 12 masha= 1 tila=96 ratis ; 14 tila=\ ser.

* The table is:—60 dpals = 1 pal; 60 pals =1 g’hari (24m.); 60 g’hart or
8 pahr = one din-rat (nycthemeron).

? Qoran, cap. CXII, which is a declaration of God’s unity.

3 The (S.) radi = 8 rice-grains (Eng. 8 barley-corns); the (S.) dasha is a kidney-
bean ; the (P.) ¢ané is about 2 0z. ; the (Ar.) #zsgal is equal to 40 ratis ; the (S.) cada
is about 145 oz. ; the (S.) sev is of various values (Wilson’s Glossary and Yule’s H.J.).

This is everywhere fixed :—40 ser = 1 manban; 12 manban =
I mani; 100 mani they call a minasa.*
Pearls and jewels they weigh by the sank.

(x. Modes of reckoning.)

The people of Hind have also an excellent mode of reckoning :
100,006 they call a lak; 100 laks, a kriir; 100 kriirs, an arb;
100 arés,1 karb; 100 karbs, 1 nil; 100 nils, 1 padam ; 100 padams,
I sang. The fixing of such high reckonings as these is proof of
the great amount of wealth in Hindistan.

(s. Hindi inhabitants of Hindistan.)

Most of the inhabitants of Hindiistan are pagans; they call
a pagan a Hindi. Most Hindiis believe in the transmigration
of souls. All artisans, wage-earners, and officials are Hindi. In
our countries dwellers in the wilds (z.e. nomads) get tribal names;
Fol. 2904. here the settled people of the cultivated lands and villages get
tribal names.? Again :—every artisan there is follows the trade
that has come down to him from forefather to forefather.

(¢. Defects of Hindistan.)

Hindiistan is a country of few charms. Its people have no
good looks; of social intercourse, paying and receiving visits there
is none; of genius and capacity none; of manners none; in
handicraft and work there is no form or symmetry, method or
quality ; there are no good horses, no good dogs, no grapes, musk-
melons or first-rate fruits, no ice or cold water, no good bread or
cooked food in the dazars, no Hot-baths, no Colleges, no candles,
torches or candlesticks.

In place of candle and torch they have a great dirty gang they
call lamp-men (awatz), who in the left hand hold a smallish
wooden tripod to one corner of which a thing like the top of

* There being 40 Bengal sers to the an, Babur’s word man6an seems to be another
name for the man or maund. I have not found manban or minasa. At first sight
manban might be taken, inthe Hai. MS. for (T.) batman, a weight of 13 or 15 lbs.,
but this does not suit. Cf. f. 167 note to batman and f, 1736 (where, however, in the
note f. 157 requires correction to f. 167). For Babur’s table of measures the Pers.

tr fi ~ =I man; 12 mans =1 mani; 100 mani they call mindsa (217,

a candlestick is fixed, having a wick in it about as thick as the
thumb. In the right hand they hold a gourd, through a narrow
slit made in which, oil is let trickle in'a thin thread when the
wick needs it. Great people keep a hundred or two of these
lamp-men. This is the Hindistan substitute for lamps and
candlesticks! Iftheir rulers and begs have work at night needing
candles, these dirty lamp-men bring these lamps, go close up and
there stand.

Except their large rivers and their standing-waters which flow
in ravines or hollows (there are no waters). There are no
running-waters in their gardens or residences (‘mdratlar).'
These residences have no charm, air (Aawd), regularity or
symmetry.

Peasants and people of low standing go about naked. They
tie on a thing called /ungita,? a decency-clout which hangs two
spans below the navel. From the tie of this pendant decency-
clout, another clout is passed between the thighs and made fast
behind. Women also tie ona cloth (4ezg), one-half of which goes
round the waist, the other is thrown over the head.

(u. Advantages of Hindistan.)

Pleasant things of Hindistan are that it is a large country and
has masses of gold and silver. Its air in the Rains is very fine.
Sometimes it rains 10, 15 or 20 times a day ; torrents pour down
all at once and rivers flow where no water had been. While it
rains and through the Rains, the air is remarkably fine, not to be
surpassed for healthiness and charm. The fault is that the air
becomes very soft and damp. A bow of those (Transoxanian)
countries after going through the Rains in Hindistan, may not
be drawn even ; it is ruined; not only the bow, everything is
affected, armour, book, cloth, and utensils all ; a house even does

* The words in parenthesis appear to be omitted from the text ; to add them brings
Babur’s remark into agreement with others on what he several times makes note of,
viz. the absence not only of irrigation-channels but of those which convey ‘‘ running-
waters” to houses and gardens. Such he writes of in Farghana ; such are a well-
known charm e.g. in Madeira, where the swift current of clear water flowing through
the streets, turns into private precincts by side-runlets.

* The Hai. MS. writes /ungita-drk, like a lungita, which better agrees with Babur’s
usual phrasing. Lzg.is Persian for a cloth passed between the loins, is an equivalent

of S. ahott, Babur’s use of it (7fra) for the woman’s (P.) chaddar or (S.) sari does
not suit the Dictionary definition of its meaning.

not last long. Not only in the Rains but also in the cold and
the hot seasons, the airs are excellent ; at these times, however,
the north-west wind constantly gets up laden with dust and earth.
It gets up in great strength every year in the heats, under the
Bull and Twins when the Rains are near ; so strong and carrying
so much dust and earth that there is no seeing one another.
People call this wind Darkener of the Sky (H. andhi). The
weather is hot under the Bull and Twins, but not intolerably
so, not so hot as in Balkh and Qandahar and not for half
so long.

Another good thing in Hindistan is that it has unnumbered
and endless workmen of every kind. There isa fixed caste (jam‘Z)
for every sort of work and for every thing, which has done that
work or that thing from father to son till now. Mulla Sharaf,
writing in the Zafar-ndma about the building of Timir Beg’s
Stone Mosque, lays stress on the fact that on it 200 stone-cutters
worked, from Azarbaijan, Fars, Hindistan and other countries.
But 680 men worked daily on my buildings in Agra and of Agra
stone-cutters only ; while 1491 stone-cutters worked daily on my
buildings in Agra, Sikri, Biana, Dilpir, Gualiar and Kuil. In

Fol. 292. the same way there are numberless artisans and workmen of
every sort in Hindistan.

(wv. Revenues of Hindistan.)

The revenue of the countries now held by me (935 AH.—
1528 AD.) from Bhira to Bihar is 52 4rars,' as will be known in
detail from the following summary? Eight or nine £rirs of this

* When Erskine published the Memoirs in 1826 Ap. he estimated this sum at
1} millions Sterling, but when he published his Zéstory of India in 1854, he had made
further research into the problem of Indian money values, and judged then that Babur’s
revenue was £4,212,000,

? Erskine here notes that the promised details had not been preserved, but in
1854 AD. he had found them in a ‘‘paraphrase of part of Babur”, manifestly in
Shaikh Zain’s work, He entered and discussed them and some matters of money-
values in Appendices D. and E. of his Héstory of India, vol. 1. Ilminsky found
them in Kehr’s Codex (C. ii, 230). The scribe of the Elph. MS. has entered the
revenues of three sarkdrs only, with his usual quotation marks indicating something
extraneous or doubtful. The Hai. MS. has them in contents precisely as I have
entered them above, but with a scattered mode of setting down. They are in Persian,
presumably as they were rendered to Babur by some Indian official. This official
statement will have been with Babur’s own papers; it will have been copied by
Shaikh Zain into his own paraphrase. It differs slightly in Erskine’s and again, in
de Courteille’s versions. I regret that I am incompetent to throw any light upon the

HISTORICAL NARRATIVE RESUMED.

(a. Déstribution of treasure in Agra.)

(May r2th) On Saturday the 29th ? of Rajab the examination
and distribution of the treasure were begun. To Humayin
were given 70 laks from the Treasury, and, over and above this,
a treasure house was bestowed on him just as it was, without
ascertaining and writing down its contents. To some begs
10 laks were given, 8, 7, or 6 to others.3 Suitable money-gifts
were bestowed from the Treasury on the whole army, to every
tribe there was, Afghan, Hazara, ‘Arab, Biliich efc. to each
according to its position. Every trader and student, indeed every
man who had come with the army, took ample portion and share
of bounteous gift and largess. To those not with the army went
a mass of treasure in gift and largess, as for instance, 17 laks to
Kamran, 15 laks to Muhammad-i-zaman Mirza, while to ‘Askari,
Hindal and indeed to the whole various train of relations and
younger children 4 went masses of red and white (gold and silver),
of plenishing, jewels and slaves.5 Many gifts went to the begs
and soldiery on that side(Tramontana). Valuable gifts (saughdt)
were sent for the various relations in Samarkand, Khurasan,
Kashghar and ‘Iraq. To holy men belonging to Samarkand
and Khurasan went offerings vowed to God (mugiir) ; so too to

* This should be 30th if Saturday was the day of the week (Gladwin, Cunningham
and Babur’s narrative of f. 269). Saturday appears likely to be right ; Babur entered
Agra on Thursday 28th ; Friday would be used for the Congregational Prayer and
preliminaries inevitable before the distribution of the treasure. The last day of
Babur’s narrative 932 AH. is Thursday Rajab 28th ; he would not be likely to mistake
between Friday, the day of his first Congregational prayer in Agra, and Saturday. It
must be kept in mind that the Description of Hindustan is an interpolation here, and
that it was written in 935 AH., three years later than the incidents here recorded.
The date Rajab 29th may not be Babur’s own entry ; or if it be, may have been
made ha the interpolation of the dividing mass of the Description and made
wrongly.

5 Erskine estimated these sums as ‘‘ probably £56,700 to Humayiin; and the
smaller ones as £8,100, £6,480, £5,670 and 44,860 respectively ; very large sums
for the age” (History of India, i. 440 n. and App. E.)

(6. Disaffection to Babur.)

On our first coming to Agra, there was remarkable dislike and
hostility between its people and mine, the peasantry and soldiers
running away in fear of our men. Delhi and Agra excepted,
not a fortified town but strengthened its defences and neither
was in obedience nor submitted. Qasim Sambhali was in
Sambhal; Nizam Khan was in Biana; in Miwat was Hasan
Khan Miwati himself, impious mannikin! who was the sole
leader of the trouble and mischief.3 Muhammad Zaztuz was in
Dilpir; Tatar Khan Sdrang-khani+ was in Gialiar; Husain
Khan Vuhani was in Rapri; Qutb Khan was in Itawa (Etawa) ;
‘Alam Khan (Kali) was in Kalpi. Qanauj and the other side
of Gang (Ganges) was all held by Afghans in independent
hostility,5 such as Nasir Khan Muhani, Ma‘rif Farmiuli and a
crowd of other amirs. These had been in rebellion for three or
four years before Ibrahim’s death and when I defeated him,
were holding Qanauj and the whole country beyond it. At
the present time they were lying two or three marches on our
side of Qanauj and had made Bihar Khan the son of Darya Khan
Nuhani their padshah, under the style Sultan Muhammad.
Marghib the slave was in Mahawin (J7u¢tra ?) ; he remained there,
thus close, for some time but came no nearer. /

t Ar. sada. Perhaps it wasa station ofa hundred men. Varsak is in Badakhshan,
on the water flowing to Taliqin from the Khwaja Muhammad range. Erskine read
(p. 335) sada Varsak as sadir rashk, incentive to emulation ; de C. (ii, 233) translates
sada conjecturally by cérconscription. Shaikh Zain has Varsak and to the recipients
of the gifts adds the ‘‘Khwastis, people noted for their piety” (A.N. trs. H.B.
i, 248 n.). The gift to Varsak may well have been made in gratitude for hospitality
received by Babur in the time of adversity after his loss of Samarkand and before his
return to Kabul in 920 AH. ~

? circa 10d. or 11d. Babur left himself stripped so bare by his far-flung largess
that he was nick-named Qalandar (Firishta). .

3 Badayiini says of him (Bib. Ind. ed. i, 340) that he was Adfir kalima-git, a pagan
making the Muhammadan Confession of Faith, and that he had heard of him, in
Akbar’s time from Bairim Khan-i-khanan, as kingly in appearance and poetic in
temperament. He was killed fighting for Rana Sanga at Kanwaha.

(c. Discontent in Babur’s army.)

It was the hot-season when we came to Agra. All the
inhabitants (Aa/dig) had run away in terror. Neither grain for
ourselves nor corn for our horses was to be had. The villages,
out of hostility and hatred to us had taken to thieving and
highway-robbery ; there was no moving on the roads. There
had been no chance since the treasure was distributed to send
men in strength into the parganas and elsewhere. Moreover
the year was a very hot one; violent pestilential winds struck
people down in heaps together ; masses began to die off.

On these accounts the greater part of the begs and best braves
became unwilling to stay in Hindustan, indeed set their faces for
leaving it. It is no reproach to old and experienced begs if they
speak of such matters ; even if they do so, this man (Babur) has
enough sense and reason to get at what is honest or what is
mutinous in their representations, to distinguish between loss
and gain. But as this man had seen his task whole, for himself,
when he resolved on it, what taste was there in their reiterating
that things should be done differently? What recommends
the expression of distasteful opinions by men of little standing
(kichik karim)? Here is a curious thing :—This last time of
our riding out from Kabul, a few men of little standing had just
been made begs ; what I looked for from them was that if I
went through fire and water and came out again, they would
have gone in with me unhesitatingly, and with me have come
out, that wherever I went, there at my side would they be,—not
that they would speak against my fixed purpose, not that they
would turn back from any task or great affair on which, all
counselling, all consenting, we had resolved, so long as that
counsel was not abandoned. Badly as these new begs behaved,
Secretary Ahmadi and Treasurer Wali behaved still worse.
Khwaja Kalan had done well in the march out from Kabul, in
Ibrahim’s defeat and until Agra was occupied ; he had spoken
bold words and _shewn ambitious views. But a few days after
the capture of Agra, all his views changed,—the one zealous for
departure at any price was Khwaja Kalan.!

_* Gul-badan says that the Khwaja several times asked leave on the ground that
his constitution was not fitted for the climate of Hindiistan; that His Majesty was
not at all, at all, willing for him to go, but gave way at length to his importunity.

(da. Babur calls a council.)

When I knew of this unsteadiness amongst (my) people, I
summoned all the begs and took counsel. Said I, “There is no
supremacy and grip on the world without means and resources;
without lands and retainers sovereignty and command (padshahliqg
uz amirlig) are impossible. By the labours of several years, by
encountering hardship, by long travel, by flinging myself and
the army into battle, and by deadly slaughter, we, through God’s
grace, beat these masses of enemies in order that we might take
their broad lands. And now what force compels us, what
necessity has arisen that we should, without cause, abandon
countries taken at such risk of life? Was it for us to remain in
Kabul, the sport of harsh poverty ? Henceforth, let no well-
wisher of mine speak of such things! But let not those turn
back from going who, weak in strong persistence, have set their
faces to depart!” By these words, which recalled just and
reasonable views to their minds, I made them, willy-nilly, quit
their fears.

(e. Khwaja Kalin decides to leave Hindistan.)

As Khwaja Kalan had no heart to stay in Hindistan, matters
were settled in this way :—As he had many retainers, he was to
convoy the gifts, and, as there were few men in Kabul and
Ghazni, was to keep these places guarded and victualled.
I bestowed on him Ghazni, Girdiz and the Sultan Mas‘idi Hazara,
gave also the Hindistan pargana of G’hiram,' worth 3 or
4 laks. It was settled for Khwaja Mir-i-mirain also to go to
Kabul ; the gifts were put into his immediate charge, under the
custody of Mulla Hasan the banker (sarraf) and Tika? Andi.

Loathing Hindistan, Khwaja Kalan, when on his way, had
the following couplet inscribed on the wall of his residence
(‘tm@rati) in Dihli -—

If safe and sound I cross the Sind,

Blacken my face ere I wish for Hind !
It was ill-mannered in him to compose and write up this partly-
jesting verse while I still stayed in Hind. If his departure

caused me one vexation, such a jest doubled it.t I composed
the following off-hand verse, wrote it down and sent it to him :—

Give a hundred thanks, Babur, that the generous Pardoner

Has given thee Sind and Hind and many a kingdom.

If thou (z.e. the Khwaja) have not the strength for their heats,
If thou say, ‘‘ Let me see the cold side (yzéz),”’ Ghazni is there.?

(f. Accretions to Babur's force.)

At this juncture, Mulla Apaq was sent into Kil with royal
letters of favour for the soldiers and quiver-wearers (¢arkash-
band) of that neighbourhood. Shaikh Giran (G’hiiran)3 came

(Authors note on Mulla Apag.) Formerly he had been in a very low
position indeed, but two or three years before this time, had gathered his
elder and younger brethren into a compact body and had brought them in

Sind.

trustfully and loyally to do obeisance, bringing with him from
2 to 3,000 soldiers and quiver-wearers from Between-two-
waters (A/ian-dit-ab).

Yinas-i-‘ali when on his way from Dihli to Agra4 had lost
his way a little and got separated from Humayin ; he then met
in with ‘Ali Khan Farmili’s sons and train,S had a small affair
with them, took them prisoners and brought them in. Taking
advantage of this, one of the sons thus captured was sent to his
father in company with Daulat-qadam Turk’s son Mirza Mughal
who conveyed royal letters of favour to ‘Ali Khan. At this
time of break-up, ‘Ali Khan had gone to Miwat; he came to

* The friends did not meet again; that their friendship weathered this storm is
shewn by Babur’s letter of f. 359. The Addshga says the couplet was inscribed on
a marble tablet near the Hawz-2-khas at the time the Khwaja was in Dihli after
bidding Babur farewell in Agra.

? This quatrain is in the Rampir Diwan (g.v. index). The Adbashga quotes the
following as Khwaja Kalan’s reply, but without mentioning where the original was
found. Cf. de Courteille, Dict. s.7. ¢askari. An English version is given in my
husband’s article Some verses by the Emperor Babur (A.Q.R. January, 1911).

Were not all things of Hind upside-down,

How could you in the heat be so pleasant on cold?
It is an old remark of travellers that everything in India is the opposite of what one
sees elsewhere. Timi is said to have remarked it and to have told his soldiers not
to be afraid of the elephants of India, ‘‘ For,” said he, ‘‘their trunks are empty

valid (?) parganas* worth 25 laks.

(g. Action against the rebels of the East.)

Sl. Ibrahim had appointed several amirs under Mustafa
Farmuli and Firtz Khan Sdrang-khani, to act against the rebel
amirs of the East (Parad). Mustafa had fought them and
thoroughly drubbed them, giving them more than one good
beating. He dying before Ibrahim’s defeat, his younger brother
Shaikh Bayazid—Ibrahim being occupied with a momentous
matter 2—had led and watched over his elder brother’s men. He
now came to serve me, together with Firiz Khan, Mahmiid Khan
Nuhanit and Qazi Jia. I shewed them greater kindness and
favour than was their claim; giving to Firiz Khan 1 £riir, 46 laks
and 5000 ¢ankas from Jinpir, to Shaikh Bayazid 1 kriir, 48 laks
and 50,000 zankas from Aid (Oude), to Mahmtid Khan 90 /aks
and 35,000 zaxkas from Ghazipir, and to Qazi Jia 20 /aks.3

(h. Gifts made to various officers.)

It was a few days after the ‘Id of Shawwal¢ that a large
party was held in the pillared-porch of the domed building
standing in the middle of Sl. Ibrahim’s private apartments. At
this party there were bestowed on Humayiin a char-gab5 a
sword-belt,° a ¢ipichag horse with saddle mounted in gold; on
Chin-timir Sultan, Mahdi Khwaja and Muhammad Sl. Mirza
char-qabs, sword-belts and dagger-belts ; and to the begs and
braves, to each according to his rank, were given sword-belts,
dagger-belts, and dresses of honour, in all to the number
specified below :—

selves with the largest item of each gift (AZemozrs p. 337).

the Ramzan fast, on seeing the first new moon of Shawwal. In a.H. 932 it must
have fallen about July 11th 1526 (Erskine).

not belts alone. There is a good deal of variation in the MSS. The Hai. MS.

On the day of this party it rained amazingly, rain falling
thirteen times. As outside places had been assigned to a good
many people, they were drowned out (gharagq).

(2. Of various forts and postings.)

Samana (in Patiala) had been given to Muhammadi Kakil-
dash and it had been arranged for him to make swift descent on
Sambal (Sambhal), but Sambal was now bestowed on Humayin,
in addition to his guerdon of Hisar-firtiza, and in his service
was Hindi Beg. To suit this, therefore, Hindi Beg was sent
to make the incursion in Muhammadi’s place, and with him
Kitta Beg, Baba Qashga’s (brother) Malik Qasim and his elder
and younger brethren, Mulla Apaq and Shaikh Giran (G’hiran)
with the quiver-wearers from Between-two-waters (Wian-dit-
ab). Three or four times a person had come from Qasim
Sambali, saying, “ The renegade Biban is besieging Sambal and
has brought it to extremity ; come quickly.” Biban, with the
array and the preparation (Aaya@t) with which he had deserted
us," had gone skirting the hills and gathering up Afghan and
Hindiistani deserters, until, finding Sambal at this juncture ill-
garrisoned, he laid siege to it. Hindi Beg and Kitta Beg and
the rest of those appointed to make the incursion, got to the
Ahar-passage ? and from there sent ahead Baba Qashga’s Malik
Qasim with his elder and younger brethren, while they them-
selves were getting over the water. Malik Qasim crossed,
advanced swiftly with from 100 to 150 men—his own and his
brethren’s—and reached Sambal by the Mid-day Prayer. Biban
for his part came out of his camp in array. Malik Qasim and
his troop moved rapidly forward, got the fort in their rear, and
came to grips. Biban could make no stand; he fled. Malik
Qasim cut off the heads of part of his force, took many horses,

a few elephants and a mass of booty. Next day when the
other begs arrived, Qasim Sambalz came out and saw them, but
not liking to surrender the fort, made them false pretences.
One day Shaikh Giran (G’hiiran) and Hindi Beg having talked
the matter over with them, got Qasim Sambalz out to the
presence of the begs, and took men of ours into the fort. They
brought Qasim’s wife and dependents safely out, and sent
Qasim (to Court).

Qalandar the foot-man was sent to Nizam Khan in Biana
with royal letters of promise and threat; with these was sent
also the following little off-hand (Persian) verse :—?

Strive not with the Turk, o Mir of Biana !

His skill and his courage are obvious.

If thou come not soon, nor give ear to counsel, —
What need to detail (aya) what is obvious ?

Bidna being one of the famous forts of Hindistan, the senseless
mannikin, relying on its strength, demanded what not even its
strength could enforce. Not giving him a good answer, we
ordered siege apparatus to be looked to.

Baba Quli Beg was sent with royal letters of promise and
threat to Muhammad Zaztin (in Dilptr); Muhammad Zaztiun
also made false excuses.

While we were still in Kabul, Rana Sanga had sent an envoy
to testify to his good wishes and to propose this plan: “If the
honoured Padshah will come to near Dihli from that side,
I from this will move on Agra.” But I beat Ibrahim, I took
Dihli and Agra, and up to now that Pagan has given no sign
soever of moving. After a while he went and laid siege to
Kandar3 a fort in which was Makan’s son, Hasan by name.
This Hasan-of-Makan had sent a person to me several times,
but had not shewn himself. We had not been able to detach
reinforcement for him because, as the forts round-about—Atawa
(Etawa), Dilpir, and Bidna—had not yet surrendered, and
the Eastern Afghans were seated with their army in obstinate
rebellion two or three marches on the Agra side of Qaniij, my
mind was not quite free from the whirl and strain of things

close at hand. Makan’s Hasan therefore, becoming helpless,
had surrendered Kandar two or three months ago.

Husain Khan (Wuhdani) became afraid in Rapri, and he
abandoning it, it was given to Muhammad ‘Ali /ang-jang.

To Qutb Khan in Etawa royal letters of promise and threat
had been sent several times, but as he neither came and saw me,
nor abandoned Etawa and got away, it was given to Mahdi
Khwaja and he was sent against it with a strong reinforcement
of begs and household troops under the command of Muhammad
Sl. Mirza, Sl. Muhammad Dd/daz, Muhammad ‘Ali Jang-jang
and ‘Abdu’l-‘aziz the Master of the Horse. Qanij was given to
Sl. Muhammad Dzldaz; he was also (as mentioned) appointed
against Etawa; so too were Firiiz Khan, Mahmid Khan,
Shaikh Bayazid and Qazi Jia, highly favoured commanders to
whom Eastern parganas had been given.

Muhammad Zaztin, who was seated in Dilpir, deceived us
and did not come. We gave Dilpiir to SI. Junaid Barlas and
reinforced him by appointing ‘Adil Sultan, Muhammadi
Kikildash, Shah Mansir Barlas, Qitliiq-qadam, Treasurer
Wali, Jan Beg, ‘Abdu’l-lah, Pir-quli, and Shah Hasan Yaragi
(or Baragz), who were to attack Dilpir, take it, make it over to
Sl. Junaid Barlas and advance on Biana.

(7. Plan of operations adopted.)

These armies appointed, we summoned the Turk amirs ' and
the Hindiistan amirs, and tossed the following matters in
amongst them :—The various rebel amirs of the East, that is to
say, those under Nasir Khan VuAdni and Ma‘rif Farmili, have
crossed Gang (Ganges) with 40 to 50,000 men, taken Qaniij,
and now lie some three miles on our side of the river. The
Pagan Rana Sanga has captured Kandar and is in a hostile and
mischievous attitude. The end of the Rains is near. It seems
expedient to move either against the rebels or the Pagan, since
the task of the forts near-by is easy; when the great foes are
got rid of, what road will remain open for the rest? Rana
Sanga is thought not to be the equal of the rebels.

* This is the first time Babur’s begs are called amirs in his book; it may be by
a scribe’s slip.


--- Page 97 ---
932 AH.—OCT. 18TH 1525 To OCT. 8TH 1526 AD. 531

To this all replied unanimously, “Rana Sanga is the most
distant, and it is not known that he will come nearer; the
enemy who is closest at hand must first be got rid of. We are
for riding against the rebels.’ Humayiin then represented,
“What need is there for the Padshah to ride out? This service
I will do.” This came as a pleasure to every-one ; the Turk and
Hind amirs gladly accepted his views ; he was appointed for the
East. A Kabuli of Ahmad-i-qdsim’s was sent galloping off to
tell the armies that had been despatched against Dilpiir to join
Humayin at Chandwar ;* also those sent against Etawa under
Mahdi Khwaja and Muhammad SI. M. were ordered to join him.

(August 21st) Humayin set out on Thursday the 13th of
Zi’l-qa‘da, dismounted at a little village called Jilisir (Jalesar)
some 3 kurohs from Agra, there stayed one night, then moved
forward march by march.

(k. Khwaja Kalan’s departure.)

(August 28th) On Thursday the 20th of this same month,
Khwaja Kalan started for Kabul.

(2. Of gardens and pleasaunces.)

One of the great defects of Hindiistan being its lack of
running-waters,? it kept coming to my mind that waters should
be made to flow by means of wheels erected wherever I might
settle down, also that grounds should be laid out in an orderly
and symmetrical way. With this object in view, we crossed the
Jiin-water to look at garden-grounds a few days after entering
Agra. Those grounds were so bad and unattractive that we
traversed them with a hundred disgusts and repulsions. So
ugly and displeasing were they, that the idea of making a
Char-bagh in them passed from my mind, but needs must! as
there was no other land near Agra, that same ground was taken
in hand a few days later.

The beginning was made with the large well from which water
comes for the Hot-bath, and also with the piece of ground where

* Chandwar is on the Jumna, between Agra and Etawah.

channels—to nourish plants and charm the eye, such for example as beautify the

the tamarind-trees and the octagonal tank now are. After that
came the large tank with its enclosure ; after that the tank and
talar* in front of the outer (?) residence? ; after that the private-
house (khilwat-khana) with its garden and various dwellings ;
after that the Hot-bath. Then in that charmless and disorderly
Hind, plots of garden3 were seen laid out with order and
symmetry, with suitable borders and parterres in every corner,
and in every border rose and narcissus in perfect arrangement.

(m. Construction of a chambered-well.)

Three things oppressed us in Hindistan, its heat, its violent
winds, its dust. Against all three the Bath is a protection, for
in it, what is known of dust and wind? and in the heats it is so
chilly that one is almost cold. The bath-room in which the
heated tank is, is altogether of stone, the whole, except for the
izara (dado?) of white stone, being, pavement and roofing, of
red Biana stone.

Khalifa also and Shaikh Zain, Yiinas-i-‘ali and whoever got
land on that other bank of the river laid out regular and orderly
gardens with tanks, made running-waters also by setting up
wheels like those in Dipalptr and Lahor. The people of Hind
who had never seen grounds planned so symmetrically and thus
laid out, called the side of the Jin where (our) residences were,
Kabul.

In an empty space inside the fort, which was between
Ibrahim’s residence and the ramparts, I ordered a large
chambered-well (diz) to be made, measuring 10 by 10, a large

2 tash ‘tmarat, which may refer to the extra-mural location of the house, or
contrast it with the inner £42/wat-khadna, the women’s quarters, of the next sentence.
The point is noted as one concerning the use of the word /ashk (Index s.#.). I have
found no instance in which it is certain that Babur uses ¢dsh, a stone or rock, as an
adjective. On f. 301 he writes tashdin ‘imdrat, house-of-stone, which the Persian
text renders by ‘émdrat-i-sangin. Wherever ¢aésh can be translated as meaning
outer, this accords with Babur’s usual diction.

in India is shewn by the 30th Ayiz, On Perfumes :—‘‘ After the foot-prints of
Firdaus-makani (Babur) had added to the glory of Hindiistan, embellishment by
avenues and landscape-gardening was seen, while heart-expanding buildings and the
sound of falling-waters widened the eyes of beholders.”

well with a flight of steps, which in Hindustan is called a wan."
This well was begun before the Char-bagh?; they were busy
digging it in the true Rains (‘azz dzshkal, Sawan and Bhadon) ;
it fell in several times and buried the hired workmen; it was
finished after the Holy Battle with Rana Sanga, as is stated in
the inscription on the stone that bears the chronogram of its
completion. It is a complete waiz, having a three-storeyed
house in it. The lowest storey consists of three rooms, each of
which opens on the descending steps, at intervals of three steps
from one another. When the water is at its lowest, it is one
step below the bottom chamber ; when it rises in the Rains, it
sometimes goes into the top storey. In the middle storey an
inner chamber has been excavated which connects with the
domed building in which the bullock turns the well-wheel. The
top storey is a single room, reached from two sides by 5 or 6
steps which lead down to it from the enclosure overlooked from
the well-head. Facing the right-hand way down, is the stone
inscribed with the date of completion. At the side of this well
is another the bottom of which may be at half the depth of the
first, and into which water comes from that first one when the
bullock turns the wheel in the domed building afore-mentioned.
This second well also is fitted with a wheel, by means of which
water is carried along the ramparts to the high-garden. A stone
building (2ashdin ‘tmarat) stands at the mouth of the well and
there is an outer (?) mosque 3 outside (dashgari) the enclosure in
which the well is. The mosque is not well done; it is in the
Hindustani fashion.

(0. News of the Aiiszbegs.)

This year ‘Ubaidu’l-lah Khan (Adzbeg) led an army out of
Bukhara against Marv. In the citadel of Marv were perhaps
10 to 15 peasants whom he overcame and killed ; then having
taken the revenues of Marv in 40 or 50 days,3 he went on to
Sarakhs. In Sarakhs were some 30 to 40 Red-heads (Qizil-bash)

who did not surrender, but shut the Gate; the peasantry however
scattered them and opened the Gate to the Aiizbeg who entering,
killed the Red-heads. Sarakhs taken, he went against Tiis and
Mashhad. The inhabitants of Mashhad being helpless, let him
in. Tiis he besieged for 8 months, took possession of on terms,
did not keep those terms, but killed every man of name and
made their women captive.

(p. Affairs of Gujrat.)

In this year Bahadur Khan,—he who now rules in Gujrat in
the place of his father Sl. Muzaffar Gujratz—having gone to
SI. Ibrahim after quarrel with his father, had been received
without honour. He had sent dutiful letters to me while I was
near Pani-pat; I had replied by royal letters of favour and
kindness summoning him to me. He had thought of coming,
but changing his mind, drew off from Ibrahim’s army towards
Gujrat. Meantime his father SI. Muzaffar had died (Friday
Jumada IJ. 2nd AH.—March 16th 1526 AD.); his elder brother
Sikandar Shah who was S]. Muzaffar’s eldest son, had become

was on his road for Gujrat, was invited and escorted to sit in

July 6th). He for his part did well ; he retaliated by death on
‘Imadu’l-mulk for his treachery to his salt, and killed some

(a. Announcement of the birth of a son.)

In Muharram Beg Wais brought the news of Fariiq’s birth ;
though a foot-man had brought it already, he came this month
for the gift to the messenger of good tidings.2 The birth must
have been on Friday eve, Shawwal 23rd (932 AH.—August 2nd
1526 AD.); the name given was Farigq.

(6. Casting of a mortar.)

(October 22nd- Muharram 15th) Ustad ‘Ali-quli had been
ordered to cast a large mortar for use against Biana and other
forts which had not yet submitted. When all the furnaces and
materials were ready, he sent a person to me and, on Monday
the 15th of the month, we went to see the mortar cast. Round
the mortar-mould he had had eight furnaces made in which
were the molten materials. From below each furnace a channel
went direct to the mould. When he opened the furnace-holes
on our arrival, the molten metal poured like water through all
these channels into the mould. After awhile and before the
mould was full, the flow stopped from one furnace after another.
Ustad ‘Ali-quli must have made some miscalculation either as
to the furnaces or the materials. In his great distress, he was
for throwing himself into the mould of molten metal, but we
comforted him, put a robe of honour on him, and so brought
him out of his shame. The mould was left a day or two to
cool ; when it was opened, Ustad ‘Ali-quli with great delight
sent to say, “ The stone-chamber (¢@sh-awz) is without defect ;
to cast the powder-compartment (darii-khana) is easy.” He got

the stone-chamber out and told off a body of men to accoutre *
it, while he busied himself with casting the powder-compartment.

(c. Varia.)

Mahdi Khwaja arrived bringing Fath Khan Sarwani from
Humiayin’s presence, they having parted from him in Dilmai.
I looked with favour on Fath Khan, gave him the parganas that
had been his father ‘Azam-humayiin’s, and other lands also, one
pargana given being worth a rir and 60 daks.?

In Hindiistan they give permanent titles [yzugarrari khitablar|
to highly-favoured amirs, one such being ‘Azam-humayin
(August Might), one Khan-i-jahan (Khan-of-the-world), another
Khan-i-khanan (Khan-of-khans). Fath Khan’s father’s title
was ‘Azam-humayin but I set this aside because on account of
Humayin it was not seemly for any person to bear it, and
I gave Fath Khan Sarwani the title of Khan-i-jahan.

(November 14th) On Wednesday the 8th of Safar3 awnings
were set up (in the Char-bagh) at the edge of the large tank
beyond the tamarind-trees, and an entertainment was prepared
there. We invited Fath Khan Sarwani to a wine-party, gave
him wine, bestowed on him a turban and head-to-foot of my
own wearing, uplifted his head with kindness and favour+ and
allowed him to go to his own districts. It was arranged for his
son Mahmid to remain always in waiting.

(gaz) that stones were its missiles. Erskine notes that from Babur’s account cannon
would seem sometimes to have been made in parts and clamped together, and that
they were frequently formed of iron bars strongly compacted into a circular shape.
The accoutrement (sa/ak) presumably was the addition of fittings.

2 About 440,000 sterling (Erskine).

3 The MSS. write Safar but it seems probable that Muharram should be
substituted for this; one ground for not accepting Safar being that it breaks the
consecutive order of dates, another that Safar allows what seems a long time for the
journey from near Dilmait to Agra. All MSS. I have seen give the 8th as the day
of the month but Erskine has 20th. In this part of Babur’s writings dates are
sparse ; it is a narrative and not a diary.

4 This phrase, foreign to Babur’s diction, smacks of a Court-Persian milieu.

5 Here the Elph. MS. has Safar Muharram (f. 253), as has also I.O. 215 f. 2004,
but it seems unsafe to take this as an a/ Safarani extension of Muharram because
Muh.-Safar 24th was not a Wednesday. As in the passage noted just above, it
seems likely that Muharram is right.

sent (to Humayin) with this injunction, “As—thanks be to
God !—the rebels have fled, do you, as soon as this messenger
arrives, appoint a few suitable begs to Jiinpiir, and come quickly
to us yourself, for Rana Sanga the Pagan is conveniently close ;
let us think first of him!”

After (Humayiin’s) army had gone to the East, we appointed,
to make a plundering excursion into the Biana neighbourhood,
Tardi Beg (brother) of Qiij Beg with his elder brother Sher-afgan,
Muhammad Khalil the master-gelder (akhta-begi) with his
brethren and the gelders (akhtachilar),. Rustam Turkman with
his brethren, and also, of the Hindiistani people, Daud Sarwani.
If they, by promise and persuasion, could make the Biana
garrison look towards us, they were to do so; if not, they were
to weaken the enemy by raid and plunder.

In the fort of Tahangar? was ‘Alam Khan the elder brated
of that same Nizam Khan of Biana. People of his had come
again and again to set forth his obedience and well-wishing ; he
now took it on himself to say, “If the Padshah appoint an army,
it will be my part by promise and persuasion to bring in the
quiver-weavers of Biana and to effect the capture of that fort.”
This being so, the following orders were given to the braves of
Tardi Beg’s expedition, “ As ‘Alam Khan, a local man, has taken
it on himself to serve and submit in this manner, act you with
him and in the way he approves in this matter of Biana.”
Swordsmen though some Hindistanis may be, most of them are
ignorant and unskilled in military move and stand (yarish u
turiish), in soldierly counsel and procedure. When our expedition
joined ‘Alam Khan, he paid no attention to what any-one else
said, did not consider whether his action was good or bad, but
went close up to Biana, taking our men with him. Our expedi-
tion numbered from 250 to 300 Turks with somewhat over 2000
Hindistanis and local people, while Nizim Khan of Biana’s
Afghans and s¢pahis3 were an army of over 4000 horse and of
foot-men themselves again, more than 10,000. Nizam Khan

looked his opponents over, sallied suddenly out and, his massed
horse charging down, put our expeditionary force to flight. His
men unhorsed his elder brother ‘Alam Khan, took 5 or 6 others
prisoner and contrived to capture part of the baggage. As we
had already made encouraging promises to Nizam Khan, we now,
spite of this last impropriety, pardoned all earlier and this later
fault, and sent him royal letters. As he heard of Rana Sanga’s
rapid advance, he had no resource but to call on Sayyid Rafi‘?
for mediation, surrender the fort to our men, and come in with
Sayyid Rafi‘, when he was exalted to the felicity of an interview.”
I bestowed on him a pargana in Mian-dii-ab worth 20 /aks.3
Dost, Lord-of-the-gate was sent for a time to Biana, but a few
days later it was bestowed on Madhi Khwaja with a fixed
allowance of 70 /aks,4 and he was given leave to go there.
Tatar Khan Sarang-khani, who was in Guwaliar, had been
sending constantly to assure us of his obedience and good-
wishes. After the pagan took Kandar and was close to Biana,
Dharmankat, one of the Guialiar rajas,and another pagan styled
Khan-i-jahan, went into the Gualiar neighbourhood and, coveting
the fort, began to stir trouble and tumult. Tatar Khan, thus
placed in difficulty, was for surrendering Gialiar (to us). Most
of our begs, household and best braves being away with
(Humayin’s) army or on various raids, we joined to Rahim-dad
a few Bhira men and Lahoris with Hastachi5 ti#ngztar and his
brethren. We assigned parganas in Gualiar itself to all those
mentioned above. Mulla Apaq and Shaikh Guran (G’huran)
went also with them, they to return after Rahim-dad was estab-
lished in Gialiar. By the time they. were near Gialiar however,
Tatar Khan’s views had changed, and he did not invite them
into the fort. Meantime Shaikh Muhammad Ghaus (Helper),
a darwish-like man, not only very learned but with a large
following of students and disciples, sent from inside the fort to
say to Rahim-dad, “ Get yourselves into the fort somehow, for

the views of this person (Tatar Khan) have changed, and he
has evil in his mind.” Hearing this, Rahim-dad sent to say to
Tatar Khan, “There is danger from the Pagan to those outside;
let me bring a few men into the fort and let the rest stay
outside.” Under insistence, Tatar Khan agreed to this, and
Rahim-dad went in with rather few men. Said he, “ Let our
people stay near this Gate,” posted them near the Hati-pul
(Elephant-gate) and through that Gate during that same night
brought in the whole of his troop. Next day, Tatar Khan,
reduced to helplessness, willy-nilly, made over the fort, and set
out to come and wait on me in Agra. A subsistence allowance
of 20 /aks was assigned to him on Bianwan pargana.*

Muhammad Zaztiin also took the only course open to him by
surrendering Dilpir and coming to wait on me. A pargana
worth a few /aks was bestowed on him. Dilpir was made
a royal domain (kha/sa) with Abi’l-fath Zurkman? as its
military-collector (shzgdar).

In the Hisar-firiza neighbourhood Hamid Khan Sarang-
khani with a body of his own Afghans and of the Pani Afghans
he had collected—from 3 to 4,000 in all—was in a‘hostile and
troublesome attitude. On Wednesday the 15th Safar (Nov. 21st)
we appointed against him Chin-timir Sl. (Chaghataz) with the
commanders Secretary Ahmadi, Abi’l-fath Zurkman, Malik
Dad Kararani3 and Mujahid Khan of Multan. These going,
fell suddenly on him from a distance, beat his Afghans well,
killed a mass of them and sent in many heads.

the title Shah-zada is a misnomer therefore in 933 AH.—one possibly prompted by
Tahmasp’s youth.

(f. Attempt to poison Babur.)

(Dec. 21st) On Friday the 16th of the first Rabi‘ a strange
event occurred which was detailed in a letter written to Kabul.
That letter is inserted here just as it was written, without
addition or taking-away, and is as follows :—*

“The details of the momentous event of Friday the 16th of
the first Rabi‘ in the date 933 [Dec. 21st 1526 AD.] are as
follows :—The ill-omened old woman? Ibrahim’s mother heard
that I ate things from the hands of Hindiistanis—the thing
being that three or four months earlier, as I had not seen
Hindistani dishes, I had ordered Ibrahim’s cooks to be brought
and out of 50 or 60 had kept four. Of this she heard, sent to
Atawa (Etawa) for Ahmad the chéshnigir—in Hindistan they
call a taster (Gakdwal) a chashnigir—and, having got him,3 gave
a tila of poison, wrapped in a square of paper,—as has been
mentioned a /#/a is rather more than 2 mzsgals 4—into the hand
of a slave-woman who was to give it to him. That poison
Ahmad gave to the Hindistani cooks in our kitchen, promising
them four parganas if they would get it somehow into the food.
Following the first slave-woman that ill-omened old woman sent
a second to see if the first did or did not give the poison she had
received to Ahmad. Well was it that Ahmad put the poison
not into the cooking-pot but ona dish! He did not put it into
the pot because I had strictly ordered the tasters to compel any
Hindistanis who were present while food was cooking in, the
pots, to taste that food. Our graceless tasters were neglectful
when the food (ash) was being dished up. Thin slices of bread
were put on a porcelain dish ; on these less than half of the
paper packet of poison was sprinkled, and over this buttered

* The letter is likely to have been written to Mahim and to have been brought
back to India by her in 935 AH. (f. 3804). Some MSS. of the Pers. trs. reproduce
it in Turki and follow this by a Persian version ; others omit the Turki.

* Turki, 6#4. Hindi dawa means sister or paternal-aunt but this would not suit
from Babur’s mouth, the more clearly not that his epithet for the offender is dad-bakhe.
Gul-badan (H.N. f. 19) calls her ‘‘ill-omened demon”. Z

H She may have been still in the place assigned to her near Agra when Babur
occupied it (f. 269).

‘4 f. 290. Erskine notes that the /#/a is about equal in weight to the silver 77.

5 It appears from the kitchen-arrangements detailed by Abi’l-fazl, that before food

was dished up, it was tasted from the pot by a cook and a subordinate taster, and next
by the Head-taster.

fritters were laid. It would have been bad if the poison had
been strewn on the fritters or thrown into the pot. In his
confusion, the man threw the larger half into the fire-place.”

“On Friday, late after the Afternoon Prayer, when the cooked
meats were set out, I ate a good deal of a dish of hare and also
much fried carrot, took a few mouthfuls of the poisoned Hindi-
stani food without noticing any unpleasant flavour, took also
a mouthful or two of dried-meat (gag). Then I felt sick. As
some dried meat eaten on the previous day had had an un-
pleasant taste, I thought my nausea due to the dried-meat.
Again and again my heart rose; after retching two or three
times I was near vomiting on the table-cloth. At last I saw it
would not do, got up, went retching every moment of the way
to the water-closet (@6-khana) and on reaching it vomited much.
Never had I vomited after food, used not to do so indeed while
drinking. I became suspicious ; I had the cooks put in ward
and ordered some of the vomit given to a dog and the dog to
be watched. It was somewhat out-of-sorts near the first watch
of the next day ; its belly was swollen and however much people
threw stones at it and turned it over, it did not get up. In that
state it remained till mid-day ; it then got up; it did not die.
One or two of the braves who also had eaten of that dish, vomited
a good deal next day ; one was in a very bad state. In the end
all escaped. (Persian) ‘An evil arrived but happily passed on!’
God gave me new-birth! I am coming from that other world ;
I am born today of my mother; I was sick; I live; through
God, I know today the worth of life!” *

“TI ordered Pay-master Sl. Muhammad to watch the cook ;
when he was taken for torture (gim), he related the above
particulars one after another.”

“Monday being Court-day, I ordered the grandees and notables,
amirs and wazirs to be present and that those two men and two
women should be brought and questioned. They there related
the particulars of the affair. That taster I had cut in pieces,
that cook skinned alive; one of those women I had thrown

“On Saturday I drank a bowl of milk, on Sunday ‘arag in
which stamped-clay was dissolved.2,_ On Monday I drank milk
in which were dissolved stamped-clay and the best theriac,3 a
strong purge. As on the first day, Saturday, something very
dark like parched bile was voided.”

I had not known so well how sweet a thing lifecan seem! As.

of life. Spite of myself, I am all upset whenever the dreadful
occurrence comes back to my mind. It must have been God’s
favour gave me life anew; with what words can I thank him?”

“Although the terror of the occurrence was too great for
words, I have written all that happened, with detail and circum-
stance, because I said to myself, ‘Don’t let their hearts be kept
in anxiety!’ Thanks be to God! there may be other days yet
to see! All has passed off well and for good; have no fear or
anxiety in your minds.”

“This was written on Tuesday the 20th of the first Rabi‘,
I being then in the Char-bagh.”

When we were free from the anxiety of these occurrences, the
above letter was written and sent to Kabul.

did not seem advisable to keep him in Agra; he was joined
therefore to Mulla Sarsan—who had come from Kamran on
important business—and was started off with the Mulla to
Kamran on Thursday Rabi‘ I. 29th (Jan. 3rd 1527 aD.).*

(h. Humayiin’s campaign.)

Humayin, acting against the Eastern rebels? took Jiina-pir
(sc), went swiftly against Nasir Khan (Va#Aanz) in Ghazi-pir
and found that he had gone across the Gang-river, presumably
on news* of Humayiin’s approach. From Ghazi-pir Humayin
went against Kharid 3 but the Afghans of the place had crossed
the Sarti-water (Gogra) presumably on the news* of his coming.
Kharid was plundered and the army turned back.

Humiayiin, in accordance with my arrangements, left Shah
Mir Husain and Sl. Junaid with a body of effective braves in
Jina-pir, posted Qazi Jia with them, and placed Shaikh Bayazid
[Farmuli| in Aude (Oude). These important matters settled,
he crossed Gang from near Karrah-Manikpir and took the
Kalpi road. When he came opposite Kalpi, in which was Jalal
Khan /zh-hat’s (son) ‘Alam Khan who had sent me dutiful
letters but had not waited on me himself, he sent some-one to
chase fear from ‘Alam Khan’s heart and so brought him along
(to Agra).

Humayin arrived and waited on me in the Garden of Eight-
paradises* on Sunday the 3rd of the 2nd Rabi‘ (Jan. 6th
1527 AD.). On the same day Khwaja Dost-i-khawand arrived
from Kabul.

certain. Hasan Khan /zwa/z is heard of also as likely to join
him. They must be thought about above all else. It would
favour our fortune, if a troop came ahead of the army to
reinforce Biana.”

Deciding to get to horse, we sent on, to ride light to Biana,
the commanders Muhammad Sl. Mirza, Yinas-i-‘ali, Shah
Mansir Barlas, Kitta Beg, Qismati* and Bijka.

In the fight with Ibrahim, Hasan Khan Mzwati’s son Nahar
Khan had fallen into our hands; we had kept him as an hostage
and, ostensibly on his account, his father had been making
comings-and-goings with us, constantly asking for him. It now
occurred to several people that if Hasan Khan were conciliated
by sending him his son, he would thereby be the more favourably
disposed and his waiting on me might be the better brought
about. Accordingly Nahar Khan was dressed in a robe of
honour ; promises were made to him for his father, and he was
given leave to go. That hypocritical mannikin [Hasan Khan]
must have waited just till his son had leave from me to go, for
on hearing of this and while his son as yet had not joined him,
he came out of Alir (Alwar) and at once joined Rana Sanga in
Toda(bhim, Agra District). It must have been ill-judged to
let his son go just then.

Meantime much rain was falling; parties were frequent; even
Humayiin was present at them and, abhorrent though it was to

enfeeblement of its garrison.’ This hollow mannikin and his
younger brother having taken the labours of this side (Cis-
Balkh?) on their own necks, come into the neighbourhood of
Aibak, Khurram and Sar-bagh.?

Shah Sikandar—his footing in Ghiiri lost through the surrender
of Balkh—is about to make over that fort to the Atizbeg, when
Mulla Baba and Baba Shaikh, coming with a few Aiizbegs, take
possession of it. Mir Hamah, as his fort is close by, has no
help for it ; he is for submitting to the Aiizbeg, but a few days
later Mulla Baba and Baba Shaikh come with a few Aiizbegs to
Mir Hamah’s fort, purposing to make the Mir and his troop
march out and to take them towards Balkh. Mir Hamah
makes Baba Shaikh dismount inside the fort, and gives the rest
felt huts (a#¢dqg) here and there. He slashes at Baba Shaikh,
puts him and some others in bonds, and sends a man galloping
off to Tingri-birdi (Qachin, in Qiindiiz). Tingri-birdi sends off
Yar-i-‘ali and ‘Abdu’l-latif with a few effective braves, but before
they reach Mir Hamah’s fort, Mulla Baba has arrived there with
his Aazbegs ; he had thought of a hand-to-hand fight (auriish-
murtsh), but he can do nothing. Mir Hamah and his men joined
Tingri-birdi’s and came to Qiindiiz. Baba Shaikh’s wound must
have been severe ; they cut his head off and Mir Hamah brought
it (to Agra) in these same days of respite. I uplifted his head
with favour and kindness, distinguishing him amongst his fellows
and equals. When Baqi shaghawal went [to Balkh]3 I promised
him a ser of gold for the head of each of the ill-conditioned old
couple; one ser of gold was now given to Mir Hamah for Baba
Shaikh’s head, over and above the favours referred to above.+

parties and had made 70 to 80 prisoners. Qismati brought news
that Hasan Khan d/iwati really had joined Rana Sanga.

(Feb. roth) On Sunday the 8th of the month (Jumada I.),
I went to see Ustad ‘Ali-quli discharge stones from that large
mortar of his in casting which the stone-chamber was without
defect and which he had completed afterwards by casting the
powder-compartment. It was discharged at the Afternoon
Prayer; the throw of the stone was 1600 paces. A gift was
made to the Master of a sword-belt, robe of honour, and
tipiichag (horse).

(m. Babur leaves Agra against Rana Sanga.)

(Feb. 11th) On Monday the 9th of the first Jumada, we got
out of the suburbs of Agra, on our journey (safar) for the Holy
War, and dismounted in the open country, where we remained
three or four days to collect our army and be its rallying-point.”
As little confidence was placed in Hindiistani people, the Hindi-
stan amirs were inscribed for expeditions to this or to that
side :—‘Alam Khan (Zahangari) was sent hastily to Gialiar to
reinforce Rahim-dad ; Makan, Qasim Beg Sanbali (Sambhalz),
Hamid with his elder and younger brethren and Muhammad
Zaitin were inscribed to go swiftly to Sanbal.

Into this same camp came the news that owing to Rana
Sanga’s swift advance with all his army,? our scouts were able
neither to get into the fort (Biana) themselves nor to send news
into it. The Biana garrison made a rather incautious sally too
far out ; the enemy fell on them in some force and put them to

of Marwar Cap. ix):—‘‘ Eighty thousand horse, 7 Rajas of the highest rank,
9 Raos, and 104 chieftains bearing the titles of Rawul and Rawut, with 500 war-
elephants, followed him into the field.” Babur’s army, all told, was 12,000 when he
crossed the Indus from Kabul ; it will have had accretions from his own officers in
the Panj-ab and some also from other quarters, and will have had losses at Panipat ;
his reliable kernel of fighting-strength cannot but have been numerically insignificant,
compared with the Rajpat host. Tod says that almost all the princes of Rajastan
followed the Rana at Kanwa.

rout... There Sangur Khan /anjuha became a martyr. Kitta
Beg had galloped into the pell-mell without his cuirass ; he got
one pagan afoot (yéyaglatib) and was overcoming him, when
the pagan snatched a sword from one of Kitta Beg’s own
servants and slashed the Beg across the shoulder. Kitta Beg
suffered great pain; he could not come into the Holy-battle
with Rana Sanga, was long in recovering and always remained
blemished.

Whether because they were themselves afraid, or whether to
frighten others is not known but Qismati, Shah Manstir Barlds
and all from Biana praised and lauded the fierceness and valour
of the pagan army.

Qasim Master-of-the-horse was sent from the starting-ground
(safar gilghan yurt) with his spadesmen, to dig many wells
where the army was next to dismount in the Madhakir pargana.

(Feb. 16th) Marching out of Agra on Saturday the 14th of
the first Jumada, dismount was made where the wells had been
dug. We marched on next day. It crossed my mind that the
well-watered ground for a large camp was at Sikri? It being
possible that the Pagan was encamped there and in possession
of the water, we arrayed precisely, in right, left and centre. As
Qismati and Darwish-i-muhammad Séréén in their comings and
goings had seen and got to know all sides of Biana, they were
sent ahead to look for camping-ground on the bank of the Sikri-
lake (a2). When we reached the (Madhakir) camp, persons
were sent galloping off to tell Mahdi Khwaja and the Biana
garrison to join me without delay. Humiayiin’s servant Beg
Mirak Mughil was sent out with a few braves to get news of
the Pagan. They started that night, and next morning brought
word that he was heard of as having arrived and dismounted at
a place one kuroh (2 miles) on our side (ai/karak) of Basawar.3
On this same day Mahdi Khwaja and Muhammad Sl. Mirza
rejoined us with the troops that had ridden light to Biana.

? Shaikh Zain records [Abi’l-fazl also, perhaps quoting from him] that Babur, by
varying diacritical points, changed the name Sikri to Shukri in sign of gratitude for his
victory over the Rana. The place became the Fathpir-sikri of Akbar.

3 Erskine locates this as 10 to 12 miles n.w. of Biana.

(0. Discomfiture of a reconnottring party.)

The begs were appointed in turns for scouting-duty. When
it was ‘Abdu’l-‘aziz’s turn, he went out of Sikri, looking neither
before nor behind, right out along the road to Kanwa which
is 5 kuroh (10m.) away. The Rana must have been marching
forward ; he heard of our men’s moving out in their reinless
(jalaii-stz) way, and made 4 or 5,000 of his own fall suddenly on
them. With ‘Abdu’l-‘aziz and Mulla Apaq may have been 1000
to 1500 men; they took no stock of their opponents but just
got to grips; they were hurried off at once, many of them being
made prisoner.

On news of this, we despatched Khalifa’s Muhibb-i-‘ali with
Khalifa’s retainers. Mulla Husain and some others aubritg-
sibrig ** were sent to support them,? and Muhammad ‘Ali Jazg-
jang also. Presumably it was before the arrival of this first,
Muhibb-i-‘ali’s, reinforcement that the Pagan had hurried off
‘Abdu’l-‘aziz and his men, taken his standard, martyred Mulla
Ni‘mat, Mulla Daiid and the younger brother of Mulla Apaq,
with several more. Directly the reinforcement arrived the
pagans overcame Tahir-tibri, the maternal uncle of Khalifa’s
Muhibb-i-‘ali, who had not got up with the hurrying reinforce-
ment {?].3 Meantime Muhibb-i-‘ali even had been thrown down,

* This phrase has not occurred in the B.N. before ; presumably it expresses what
has not yet been expressed ; this Erskine’s rendering, ‘‘ each according to the speed
of his horse,” does also. The first Persian translation, which in this portion is by
Muhammad-quli Mughal Hisari, translates by az dambal yak digar (1.0. 215, f. 2054) ;
the second, ‘Abdu’r-rahim’s, merely reproduces the phrase; De Courteille (ii, 272)
appears to render it by (amirs) gue je ne nomme pas. If my reading of Tahir-tibri’s
failure be correct (izfra), Erskine’s translation suits the context.

2 The passage cut off by my asterisks has this outside interest that it forms the intro-
duction to the so-called ‘‘ Fragments”, that is; to certain Turki matter not included
in the standard Babur-nadma, but preserved with the Kehr—Ilminsky — de Courteille
text. As is well-known in Baburiana, opinion has varied as to the genesis of this
matter; there is now no doubt that it is a translation into Turki from the (Perséan)
Akbar-nama, prefaced by the above-asterisked passage of the Babur-ndma and
continuous (with slight omissions) from Bib. Ind. ed. i, 106 to 120 (trs. H. Beveridge
i, 260 to 282). It covers the time from before the battle of Kanwa to the end of
Abii’l-fazl’s description of Babur’s death, attainments and Court ; it has been made
to seem Babur’s own, down to his death-bed, by changing the third person of A.F.’s
narrative into the autobiographical first person. (Cf. Ilminsky, p. 403 1. 4 and
P- 494; Alémotres ii, 272 and 443 to 464; JRAS. 1908, p. 76.)

A minute point in the history of the B.N. manuscripts may be placed on record
here ; v2. that the variants from the true Babur-ndma text which occur in the Kehr —
Ilminsky one, occur also in the corrupt Turki text of I.O. No. 214 (JRAS 1900, p. 455).

but Balti getting in from the rear, brought him out. The enemy
pursued for over a £urvoh (2 m.), stopped however at the sight of
the black mass of Muh. ‘Ali /ang-jang’s troops.

Foot upon foot news came that the foe had come near and
nearer. We put on our armour and our horses’ mail, took our
arms and, ordering the carts to be dragged after us, rode out at
the gallop. We advanced one kuroh. The foe must have
turned aside.

(p. Babur fortifies his camp.)

For the sake of water, we dismounted with a large lake (Ai/)
on one side of us. Our front was defended by carts chained
together*, the space between each two, across which the chains
stretched, being 7 or 8 gari (circa yards). Mustafa Rimi had

and suitable.t As Ustad ‘Ali-quli was jealous of him, Mustafa
was posted to the right, in front of Humayiin. Where the carts
did not reach to, Khurasani and Hindistani spadesmen and
miners were made to dig a ditch.

Owing to the Pagan’s rapid advance, to the fighting-work in
Biana and to the praise and laud of the pagans made by Shah
Mansiir, Qismati and the rest from Biana, people in the army
shewed sign of want of heart. On the top of all this came the _
defeat of ‘Abdu’l-‘aziz. In order to hearten our men, and give
a look of strength to the army, the camp was defended and shut
in where there were no carts, by stretching ropes of raw hide on
wooden tripods, set 7 or 8 gavi apart. Time had drawn out to

20 or 25 days before these appliances and materials were fully
ready.”

Just at this time there arrived from Kabul Qasim-i-husain

? According tc Tod’s Rajastan, negotiations went on during the interval, having
for their object the fixing of a frontier between the Rana and Babur. They were
conducted by a “‘traitor” Salah’d-din 7#ar the chief of Raisin, who moreover is
said to have deserted to Babur during the battle.

counting up in all to 500 men. Muhammad Sharif, the astrologer
of ill-augury, came with them too, so did Baba Dost the water-
bearer (s#chz) who, having gone to Kabul for wine, had there
loaded three strings of camels with acceptable Ghazni wines.

At a time such as this, when, as has been mentioned, the army
was anxious and afraid by reason of past occurrences and vicissi-
tudes, wild words and opinions, this Muhammad Sharif, the
ill-augurer, though he had not a helpful word to say to me, kept
insisting to all he met, “Mars is in the west in these days ;'
who comes into the fight from this (east) side will be defeated.”
Timid people who questioned the ill-augurer, became the more
shattered in heart. We gave no ear to his wild words, made no
change in our operations, but got ready in earnest for the fight.

(Feb. 24th). On Sunday the 22nd (of Jumada I.) Shaikh
Jamal was sent to collect all available quiver-wearers from
between the two waters (Ganges and Jumna) and from Dihli, so
that with this force he might over-run and plunder the Miwat
villages, leaving nothing undone which could awaken the enemy’s
anxiety for that side. Mulla Tark-i-‘ali, then on his way from
Kabul, was ordered to join Shaikh Jamal and to neglect nothing
of ruin and plunder in Miwat ; orders to the same purport were
given also to Maghftr the Diwan. They went; they over-ran
and raided a few villages in lonely corners (4ijgaq) ; they took
some prisoners; but their passage through did not arouse much
anxiety !

(vr. Babur renounces wine.)

On Monday the 23rd of the first Jumada (Feb. 25th), when
I went out riding, I reflected, as I rode, that the wish to cease
from sin had been always in my mind, and that my forbidden
acts had set lasting stain upon my heart. Said I, “Oh! my
soul!”

(Persian) ‘* How long wilt thou draw savour from sin?
Repentance is not without savour, taste it !”?

found elsewhere. It is not inthe Rampir Diwan which contains the Turki verses
following it (E. D. Ross p. 21).

(Turki) Through years how many has sin defiled thee ?
How much of peace has transgression given thee ?
How much hast thou been thy passions’ slave ?
How much of thy life flung away ?

With the Ghiazi’s resolve since now thou hast marched,
Thou hast looked thine own death in the face!

Who resolves to hold stubbornly fast to the death,
Thou knowest what change he attains,

That far he removes him from all things forbidden,
That from all his offences he cleanses himself.
With my own gain before me, I vowed to obey,

In this my transgression,‘ the drinking of wine.?

The flagons and cups of silver and gold, the vessels of feasting,
T had them all brought ;

I had them all broken up3 then and there.

Thus eased I my heart by renouncement of wine.

The fragments of the gold and silver vessels were shared out
to deserving persons and to darwishes. The first to agree in
renouncing wine was ‘Asas;+ he had already agreed also about
leaving his beard untrimmed.£ That night and next day some
300 begs and persons of the household, soldiers and not soldiers,
renounced wine. What wine we had with us was poured on the
ground ; what Baba Dost had brought was ordered salted to
make vinegar. At the place where the wine was poured upon
the ground, a well was ordered to be dug, built up with stone
and having an almshouse beside it. It was already finished in
Muharram 935 (AH.—Sep. 1528 AD.) at the time I went to
Sikri from Dilpiir on my way back from visiting Gialiar.

* kichmaklik, to pass over (to exceed ?), to ford or go through a river, whence to
transgress. The same metaphor of crossing a stream occurs, in connection with
drinking, on f. 1894,

? This line shews that Babur’s renouncement was of wine only; he continued to
eat confections (ma‘ji7).

3 Cf. f. 1865. Babur would announce his renunciation in Diwan ; there too the
forbidden vessels of precious metals would be broken. His few words leave it to his
readers to picture the memorable scene.

4 This night-guard (‘asas) cannot be the one concerning whom Gul-badan records
that he was the victim of a little joke made at his expense by Babur (EH. N. Index s.7.).
He seems likely to be the 114ji Muh. ‘esas whom Abi’l-fazl mentions in connection
with Kamran in 953 AH. (1547 AD.). He may be the ‘asas who took charge of
Babur’s tomb at Agra (cf. Gul-badan’s H. N. s.2. Muh. ‘Ali ‘asas faghai, and
Akbar-nama trs. i, 502). ;

(s. Remission of a due.)

I had vowed already that, if I gained the victory over Sanga
the pagan, I would remit the zamgha* to all Musalmans. Of
this vow Darwish-i-muhammad Sdérban and Shaikh Zain
reminded me at the time I renounced wine. Said I, “ You do
well to remind me.”

* The tamgha was remitted to all Musalmans of the dominions
I held.? I sent for the clerks (wexnshilar), and ordered them to
write for their news-letters (akhbar) the farman concerning the
two important acts that had been done. Shaikh Zain wrote
the farman with his own elegance (ushasi bila) and his fine
letter (¢ush@) was sent to all my dominions. It is as
follows :—3

FARMAN ANNOUNCING BABUR’S RENUNCIATION
OF WINE

5 Let us praise the Long-suffering One who loveth the penitent
and who loveth the cleansers of themselves; and let thanks be
rendered to the Gractous One who absolveth His debtors, and
Sorgiveth those who seek forgiveness. Blessings be upon Muhammad
the Crown of Creatures, on the Holy family, on the pure Com-
anions, and on the mirrors of the glorious congregation, to wit,
the Masters of Wisdom who are treasure-houses of the pearls of
purity and who bear the impress of the sparkling jewels of this
purport :—that the nature of man is prone to evil, and that the
abandonment of sinful appetites is only feasible by Divine aid

* Index s.z. The /amgha@ was not really abolished until Jahangir’s time—if then
(H. Beveridge). See Thomas’ Revenue Resources of the Mughal Empire.

? There is this to notice here :—Babur’s narrative has made the remission of the
tamgha contingent on his success, but the farmdax which announced that remission is
dated some three weeks before his victory over Rana Sanga (Jumada II, 13th—
March 16th). Manifestly Babur’s remission was absolute and made at the date given
by Shaikh Zain as that of the farman. The Jarman seems to have been despatched
as soon as it was ready, but may have been inserted in Babur’s narrative at a later
date, together with the preceding paragraph which I have asterisked.

3 “There is a lacuna in the Turki copy” (¢.e. the Elphinstone Codex) ‘‘from this
Place to the beginning of the year 935. Till then I therefore follow only
Mr. Metcalfe’s and my own Persian copies” (Erskine).

4 I am indebted to my husband for this revised version of the farmdn. He is
indebted to M. de Courteille for help generally, and specially for the references to the
Qoran (7.v. 2nfra).

and the help that cometh from on high. “Every soul 7s prone
unto evil,”* (and again) “This zs the bounty of God; He will give
the same unto whom He pleaseth ; and God 1s endued with great
bounty.” 2

Our motive for these remarks and for repeating these state-
ments is that, by reason of human frailty, of the customs of
kings and of the great, all of us, from the Shah to the sipahi, in
the heyday of our youth, have transgressed and done what we
ought not to have done. After some days of sorrow and
repentance, we abandoned evil practices one by one, and the
gates of retrogression became closed. But the renunciation of
wine, the greatest and most indispensable of renunciations,
remained under a veil in the chamber of deeds pledged to appear
tn due season, and did not show its countenance until the
glorious hour when we had put on the garb of the holy warrior
and had encamped with the army of Islam over against the
infidels in order to slay them. On this occasion I received
a secret inspiration and heard an infallible voice say “Js not the
time yet come unto those who believe, that their hearts should
humbly submit to the admonition of God, and that truth which
hath been revealed ?” 3 Thereupon we set ourselves to extirpate
the things of wickedness, and we earnestly knocked at the gates
of repentance. The Guide of Help assisted us, according to the
saying “ Whoever knocks and re-knocks, to him tt will be opened”,
and an order was given that with the Holy War there should
begin the still greater war which has to be waged against
sensuality. In short, we declared with sincerity that we would
subjugate our passtons,and I engraved on the tablet of my heart
“T turn unto Thee with repentance, and I am the first of true
believers”.4 And I made public the resolution to abstain from
wine, which had been hidden in the treasury of my breast. The
victorious servants, in accordance with the illustrious order,
dashed upon the earth of contempt and destruction the flagons
and the cups, and the other utensils in gold and silver, which in
their number and their brilliance were like the stars of the
firmament. They dashed them in pieces, as, God willing! soon

will be dashed the gods of the idolaters,—and they distributed
the fragments among the poor and needy. By the blessing of
this acceptable repentance, many of the courtiers, by virtue of
the saying that men follow the religion of their kings, embraced
abstinence at the same assemblage, and entirely renounced the
use of wine, and up till now crowds of our subjects hourly
attain this auspicious happiness. I hope that in accordance
with the saying “He who iucttes to good deeds has the same
reward as he who does them” the benefit of this action will react
on the royal fortune and increase it day by day by victories.

After carrying out this design an universal decree was issued
that in the imperial dominions—May God protect them from

every danger and calamity—no-one shall partake of strong
~ drink, or engage in its manufacture, nor sell it, nor buy it or
possess it, nor convey it or fetch it. “Beware of touching tt.”
“ Perchance this will give you prosperity.” *

In thanks for these great victories,? and as a thank-offering
for God’s acceptance of repentance and sorrow, the ocean of the
royal munificence became commoved, and those waves of kind-
ness, which are the cause of the civilization of the world and of
the glory of the sons of Adam, were displayed,—and through-
out all the territories the tax (¢amghd@) on Musalmans was
abolished,—though its yield was more than the dreams of
avarice, and though it had been established and maintained by
former rulers,—for it is a practice outside of the edicts of the
Prince of Apostles (Muhammad). So a decree was passed that
in no city, town, road, ferry, pass, or port, should the tax be
levied or exacted. No alteration whatsoever of this order is
to be permitted. “ Whoever after hearing tt makes any change
therein, the sin of such change will be upon him.” 3

the royal benevolence, whether they be Turk, Tajik, ‘Arab, Hindi,

de Courteille (ii, 281) but as the Divine ‘‘ acceptance ” would seem to Babur vouched
for by his military success, ‘‘victories” may stand for his success at Kanwa.

any one soever. What bold speech was there from the wazirs
who are to speak out (digichi), or from the amirs who will
devour the land (w2/ayat-yighichi)?* None had advice to give,
none a bold plan of his own to expound. Khalifa (however)
did well in this campaign, neglecting nothing of control and
supervision, painstaking and diligence.

At length after [ had made enquiry concerning people’s want
of heart and had seen their slackness for myself, a plan occurred
to me; I summoned all the begs and braves and said to them,
“ Begs and braves !

(Persian) Who comes into the world will die ;
What lasts and lives will be God.

(Turki) He who hath entered the assembly of life,
Drinketh at last of the cup of death.

He who hath come to the inn of life,
Passeth at last from Earth’s house of woe.

* The words digichi and yigichi are translated in the second Wagi‘at-7-baburi by
sukhan-gui and [wildyat)-khwar. This ignores in them the future element supplied
by their component g# which would allow them to apply to conditions dependent
on Babur’s success. The Hai. MS. and Ilminsky read ¢iguchi, supporter- or helper-
to-be, in place of the yigichi, eater-to-be I have inferred from the Aiwar of the Pers.
translation ; hence de Courteille writes ‘‘amirs auxguels incombait 1’ obligation de
vraffermir le gouvernement”. But Erskine, using the Pers. text alone, and thus
having £+war before him, translates by, ‘‘amirs who enjoyed the wealth of kingdoms.”
The two Turki words make a depreciatory ‘‘ jingle”, but the first one, digichi, may
imply serious reference to the duty, declared by Muhammad to be incumbent upon
a wazir, of reminding his sovereign ‘‘ when he forgetteth his duty”. Both may be
taken as alluding to dignities to be attained by success in the encounter from which
wazirs and amirs were shrinking.

“Better than life with a bad name, is death with a good one.

(Persian) Well is it with me, if I die with good name !
A good name must I have, since the body is death’s.*

“God the Most High has allotted to us such happiness and has
created for us such good-fortune that we die as martyrs, we kill
as avengers of His cause. Therefore must each of you take oath
upon His Holy Word that he will not think of turning his face
from this foe, or withdraw from this deadly encounter so long as
life is not rent from his body.” All those present, beg and
retainer, great and small, took the Holy Book joyfully into
their hands and made vow and compact to this purport. The
plan was perfect ; it worked admirably for those near and afar,
for seérs and hearers, for friend and foe.

(u. Babur's perilous position.)

In those same days trouble and disturbance arose on every
side :—Husain Khan Vuhani went and took Rapri; Qutb Khan’s
man took Chandwar?; a mannikin called Rustam Khan who
had collected quiver-wearers from Between-the-two-waters
(Ganges and Jamna), took Kil (Koel) and made Kichik ‘Ali
prisoner; Khwaja Zahid abandoned Sambal and went off;
Sl. Muhammad Dé#/daz came from Qanij to me; the Gialiar
pagans laid siege to that fort; ‘Alam Khan when sent to
reinforce it, did not go to Gualiar but to his own district. Every
day bad news came from every side. Desertion of many
Hindistanis set in; Haibat Khan Karg-andaz3 deserted and
went to Sambal; Hasan Khan of Bari deserted and joined the
Pagan. We gave attention to none of them but went straight
on with our own affair.

(uv. Babur advances to fight.)

The apparatus and appliances, the carts and wheeled tripods
being ready, we arrayed in right, left and centre, and marched
forward on New Year’s Day,4 Tuesday, the 9th of the second
Jumada (March 13th), having the carts5 and wheeled tripods

moving in front of us, with Ustad ‘Ali-quli and all the matchlock-
men ranged behind them in order that these men, being on foot,
should not be left behind the array but should advance with it.

When the various divisions, right, left and centre, had gone
each to its place, I galloped from one to another to give
encouragement to begs, braves, and szpahis. After each man
had had assigned to him his post and usual work with his
company, we advanced, marshalled on the plan determined, for
as much as one £uroh (2 m.)* and then dismounted.

The Pagan’s men, for their part, were on the alert; they
came from their side, one company after another.

The camp was laid out and strongly protected by ditch and
carts. As we did not intend to fight that day, we sent a few
unmailed braves ahead, who were to get to grips with the enemy
and thus take an omen. They made a few pagans prisoner,
cut off and brought in their heads. Malik Qasim also cut off
and brought in a few heads; he did well. By these successes
the hearts of our men became very strong.

When we marched on next day, I had it in my mind to
fight, but Khalifa and other well-wishers represented that the
camping-ground previously decided on was near and that it
would favour our fortunes if we had a ditch and defences made
there and went there direct. Khalifa accordingly rode off to get
the ditch dug; he settled its position with the spades-men,
appointed overseers of the work and returned to us.

(w. The battle of Kanwa.)?

On Saturday the 13th of the second Jumada (March 17th,
1527 AD.) we had the carts dragged in front of us (as before),
made a kuroh (2 m.) of road, arrayed in right, left and centre,
and dismounted on the ground selected.

* kurohcha, perhaps a short kuroh, but I have not found Babur using cha as a
diminutive in such a case as Aurohcha.

been determined on by Rana Sangram Singh (z.e. Sanga) for the northern limit of his
dominions, and he had here built a small palace.” Tod thus describes Babur’s foe,
‘‘Sanga Rana was of the middle stature, and of great muscular strength, fair in
complexion, with unusually large eyes which appear to be peculiar to his descendants.
He exhibited at his death but the fragments of a warrior: one eye was lost in the
broil with his brother, an arm in action with the Lodi kings of Dehli, and he was
a cripple owing to a limb being broken by a cannon-ball in another ; while he
counted 80 wounds from the sword or the lance on various parts of his body” (Tod’s
Rajastan, cap. Annals of Mewar).

A few tents had been set up; a few were in setting up when
news of the appearance of the enemy was brought. Mounting
instantly, I ordered every man to his post and that our array
should be protected with the carts."

-* As the following Letter-of-victory (Fath-nadma) which is
what Shaikh Zain had indited, makes known particulars about
the army of Islam, the great host of the pagans with the position
of their arrayed ranks, and the encounters had between them
and the army of Islam, it is inserted here without addition or
deduction.?

SHAIKH ZAIN’S LETTER-OF-VICTORY.
(a. Introduction.)

Praise be to God the Faithful Promiser, the Helper of His
servants, the Supporter of His armies, the Scatterer of hostile
hosts, the One alone without whom there ts nothing.

t Here M. de C. has the following note (ii, 273n.); it supplements my own of
f. 264 [n. 3]. ‘°° Le mot araba, que 7j’ai tradutt par chariot est pris par M. Leyden”
(this should be Erskine) ‘‘dans le sens de ‘ gun’, ce que je ne crots pas exact ; tout
au plus signifierait-il affat” (gun-carriage). ‘‘ Ji me parait impossible a’ admettre
que Baber efit a sa disposition une artillerie attelée ausst considérable. Ces araba
pouvaient servir en partie a transporter des pieces de campagne, mats tls avaient aussi
une autre destination, comme on le voit par la suite du récit.” It does not appear to
me that Erskine ¢ravs/ates the word araba by the word gzz, but that the ardbas
(all of which he took to be gun-carriages) being there, he supposed the guns. This
was not correct as the various passages about carts as defences show (cf. Index
5.0m. araba and carts).

? It is characteristic of Babur that he reproduces Shaikh Zain’s Fath-nadma, not
because of its eloquence but because of its useful details. Erskine and de Courteille
have the following notes concerning Shaikh Zain’s farman :—‘‘ Nothing can form
@ more striking contrast to the simple, manly and intelligent style of Baber himself,
than the pompous, laboured periods of his secretary. Yet I have never read this
Firman to any native of India who did not bestow unlimited admiration on the
Official bombast of Zeineddin, while I have met with none but Turks who paid due
praise to the calm simplicity of Baber” [Mems. p. 359]. ‘‘ Comme la précédente
(Jarman), cette pidce est rédigée en langue persane et offre un modéle des plus accomplis
du style en usage dans les chancelleries orientales. La traduction d’un semblable
morceau d éloguence est de la plus grande difficulté, si on veut étre clair, tout en restant
Sidéle 2 V original.”

Like the Renunciation farman, the Letter-of-victory with its preceding sentence
which I have asterisked, was probably inserted into Babur’s narrative somewhat
later than the battle of Kanwa. Hence Babur’s pluperfect-tense ‘‘had indited”.
I am indebted to my husband for help in revising the difficult Fath-nama; he
has done it with consideration of the variants between the earlier English and the
French translations. No doubt it could be dealt with more searchingly still by one
well-versed in the Qoran and the Traditions, and thus able to explain others of its
allusions. The italics denote Arabic passages in the original; many of these are

a the Qoran, and in tracing them M. de Courteille’s notes have been most useful
0 us.

560 HINDUSTAN

O Thou the Exalter of the pillars of Islam, Helper of thy
faithful minister, Overthrower of the pedestals of tdols, Overcomer
of rebellious foes, Exterminator to the uttermost of the followers of
darkness !

Lauds be to God the Lord of the worlds, and may the blessing
of God be upon the best ‘of His creatures Muhammad, Lord of
ghazis and champions of the Faith, and upon his companions, the
pointers of the way, until the Day of judgment.

The successive gifts of the Almighty are the cause of frequent
praises and thanksgivings, and the number of these praises and
thanksgivings is, in its turn, the cause of the constant succession
of God’s mercies. For every mercy a thanksgiving is due, and
every thanksgiving is followed by a mercy. To render full
thanks is beyond men’s power; the mightiest are helpless to
discharge their obligations. Above all, adequate thanks cannot
be rendered for a benefit than which none is greater in the
world and nothing is more blessed, in the world to come, to wit,
victory over most powerful infidels and dominion over wealthiest
heretics, “ these are the unbelievers, the wicked.”* In the eyes of
the judicious, no blessing can be greater than this. Thanks be
to God! that this great blessing and mighty boon, which from
the cradle until now has been the real object of this right-thinking
mind (Babur’s), has now manifested itself by the graciousness of
the King of the worlds ; the Opener who dispenses his treasures
without awaiting solicitation, hath opened them with a master-
key before our victorious Nawab (Babur),? so that the names of
our 3 conquering heroes have been emblazoned in the records of
glorious ghazis. By the help of our victorious soldiers the
standards of Islam have been raised to the highest pinnacles.
The account of this auspicious fortune is as follows :—

t Qoran, cap. 80, last sentence.

? Shaikh Zain, in his version of the Babur-nama, styles Babur Nawab where there
can be no doubt of the application of the title, v¢z. in describing Shah Tahmasp’s
gifts to him (mentioned by Babur on f. 305). He uses the title also in the farman of
renunciation (f. 3136), but it does not appear in my text, ‘‘ royal” (fortune) standing
for it (#7 loco p. 555, |. 10).

3 The possessive pronoun occurs several times in the Letter-of-victory. As there
is no semblance of putting forward that letter as being Babur’s, the pronoun seems to
imply ‘‘ on our side”.

(6. Rana Sanga and his forces.)

When the flashing-swords of our Islam-guarded soldiers had
illuminated the land of Hindistan with rays of victory and
conquest, as has been recorded in former letters-of-victory,*
the Divine favour caused our standards to be upreared in the
territories of Dihli, Agra, Jin-pir, Kharid,? Bihar, e¢c., when
many chiefs, both pagans and Muhammadans submitted to our
generals and shewed sincere obedience to our fortunate Nawab.
But Rana Sanga the pagan who in earlier times breathed
submissive to the Nawab,3 now was puffed up with pride and
became of the number of unbelievers4 Satan-like he threw back
his head and collected an army of accursed heretics, thus
gathering a rabble-rout of whom some wore the accursed torque
(Zaug), the zinar,5 on the neck, some had in the skirt the
calamitous thorn of apostacy.© Previous to the rising in Hindi-
stan of the Sun of dominion and the emergence there of the
light of the Shahanshah’s Khalifate [z.e. Babur’s] the authority
of that execrated pagan (Sanga)—at the Judgment Day he shall
have no friend was such that not one of all the exalted
sovereigns of this wide realm, such as the Sultan of Dihli, the
Sultan of Gujrat and the Sultan of Mandi, could cope with this
evil-dispositioned one, without the help of other pagans; one
and all they cajoled him and temporized with him; and he had
this authority although the rajas and rais of high degree, who
obeyed him in this battle, and the governors and commanders

* The Babur-ndma includes no other than Shaikh Zain’s about Kanwa. Those
here alluded to will be the announcements of success at Milwat, Panipat, Dibalpir
and perhaps elsewhere in Hindiistan.

? In Jiin-pir (Ayin-2-akbari) ; Elliot & Dowson note (iv, 283-4) that it appears
to have included, near Sikandarpir, the country on both sides of the Gogra, and
thence on that river’s left bank down to the Ganges.

3 That the word Nawab here refers to Babur and not to his lieutenants, is shewn
by his mention (f. 278) of Sanga’s messages to himself.

* Qoran, cap. 2, v. 32. The passage quoted is part of a description of Satan,
hence mention of Satan in Shaikh Zain’s next sentence.

5 The brahminical thread.

® khar-t-mihnat-i-irtidad dar diman. This Erskine renders by ‘‘who fixed thorns
from the pangs of apostacy in the hem of their garments” (p. 360). Several good
MSS. have Zar, thorn, but Ilminsky has Ar. AAzma@r, cymar, instead (p. 411).
De Courteille renders the passage by ‘‘ Zortent au pan de leurs habits la marque
douloureuse de V’apostasie” (ii, 290). To read khimar, cymar (scarf), would serve,
as a scarf is part of some Hindi costumes.

who were amongst his followers in this conflict, had not obeyed
him in any earlier fight or, out of regard to their own dignity,
been friendly with him. Infidel standards dominated some
200 towns in the territories of Islam; in them mosques and
shrines fell into ruin; from them the wives and children of the
Faithful were carried away captive. So greatly had his forces
grown that, according to the Hindi calculation by which one
lak of revenue should yield 100 horsemen, and one &rar of
revenue, 10,000 horsemen, the territories subject to the Pagan
(Sanga) yielding 10 £rirs, should yield him 100,000 horse.
Many noted pagans who hitherto had not helped him in battle,
now swelled his ranks out of hostility to the people of Islam.
Ten powerful chiefs, each the leader of a pagan host, uprose in
rebellion, as smoke rises, and linked themselves, as though
enchained, to that perverse one (Sanga); and this infidel decade
who, unlike the blessed ten,? uplifted misery-freighted standards
which denounce unto them excruciating punishment? had many
dependants, and troops, and wide-extended lands. As, for
instance, Salahu’d-din3 had territory yielding 30,000 horse,
Rawal Udai Singh of Bagar had 12,000, Medini Rai had 12,000,
Hasan Khan of Miwat had 12,000, Bar-mal of Idr had 4,000,
Narpat Hara had 7,000, Satrvi of Kach (Cutch) had 6,000,
Dharm-deo had 4,000, Bir-sing-deo had 4,000, and Mahmid
Khan, son of SI. Sikandar, to whom, though he possessed neither
district nor pargana, 10,000 horse had gathered in hope of his
attaining supremacy. Thus, according to the calculation of
Hind, 201,000 was the total of those sundered from salvation.
In brief, that haughty pagan, inwardly blind, and hardened of

* M. Defrémery, when reviewing the French translation of the B.N. (Journal des
Savans 1873), points out (p. 18) that it makes no mention of the ‘‘ blessed ten”.
Erskine mentions them but without explanation. They are the ‘askharah mubash-
sharah, the decade of followers of Muhammad who “‘ received good tidings”, and
whose certain entry into Paradise he foretold.

2 Qoran, cap. 3, v. 20. M. Defrémery reads Shaikh Zain to mean that these
words of the Qoran were on the infidel standards, but it would be simpler to read
Shaikh Zain as meaning that the infidel insignia on the standards *‘ denounce
punishment ”’ on their users.

3 He seems to have been a Rajpit convert to Muhammadanism who changed his
Hindi name Silhadi for what Babur writes. His son married Sanga’s daughter ;
his fiefs were Raisin and Sarangpiir; he deserted to Babur in the battle of Kanwa.

heart, having joined with other pagans, dark-fated and doomed
to perdition, advanced to contend with the followers of Islim
and to destroy the foundations of the law of the Prince of Men
(Muhammad), on whom be God’s blessing! The protagonists
of the royal forces fell, like divine destiny, on that one-eyed
Dajjal* who, to understanding men, shewed the truth of the
saying, When Fate arrives, the eye becomes blind, and, setting
before their eyes the scripture which saith, Whosoever striveth
to promote the true religion, striveth for the good of his own soul,
they acted on the precept to which obedience is due, Fight
against infidels and hypocrites.

(c. Military movements.)

(March 17th, 1527) On Saturday the 13th day of the second
Jumada of the date 933, a day blessed by the words, God hath
blessed your Saturday, the army of Islam was encamped near
the village of Kanwa, a dependency of Biana, hard by a hill
which was 2 kuvohs (4 m.) from the enemies of the Faith.
When those accursed infidel foes of Muhammad’s religion heard
the reverberation of the armies of Islam, they arrayed their
ill-starred forces and moved forward with one heart, relying on
their mountain-like, demon-shaped elephants, as had relied the

Lords of the Elephant3 who went to overthrow the sanctuary
(ka‘ba) of Islam.

t “Dejal or al Masih al Dajjal, the false or lying Messiah, is the Muhammadan
Anti-christ. He is to be one-eyed, and marked on the forehead with the letters
K.F.R. signifying Kafer, or Infidel. He is to appear in the latter days riding on an
ass, and will be followed by 70,000 Jews of Ispahan, and will continue on the Earth
40 days, of which one will be equal to a year, another to a month, another to a week,
and the rest will be common days. He is to lay waste all places, but will not enter
Mekka or Medina, which are to be guarded by angels. He is finally to be slain at
the gate of Lud by Jesus, for whom the Musalmans profess great veneration, calling
him the breath or spirit of God.—See Sale’s /ntroductory Discourse to the Koran”
[Erskine].

3 “This alludes to the defeat of [an Abyssinian Christian] Abraha the prince of
Yemen who [in the year of Muhammad’s birth] marched his army and some elephants
to destroy the 4a‘éa of Makka. ‘The Meccans,’ says Sale, ‘at the appearance of so
considerable a host, retired to the neighbouring mountains, being unable to defend
their city or temple. But God himself undertook the defence of both. For when
Abraha drew near to Mecca, and would have entered it, the elephant on which he
rode, which was a very large one and named Mahmid, refused to advance any nigher
to the town, but knelt down whenever they endeavoured to force him that way,
though he would rise and march briskly enough if they turned him towards any other
quarter ; and while matters were in this posture, on a sudden a large flock of birds,
like swallows, came flying from the sea-coast, every-one of which carried three stones,

“* Having these elephants, the wretched Hindus
Became proud, like the Lords of the Elephant ;
Yet were they odious and vile as is the evening of death,
Blacker * than night, outnumbering the stars,
All such as fire is? but their heads upraised
In hate, as rises its smoke in the azure sky,
Ant-like they come from right and from left,
Thousands and thousands of horse and foot.”

They advanced towards the victorious encampment, intending
to give battle. The holy warriors of Islam, trees in the garden
of valour, moved forward in ranks straight as serried pines and,
like pines uplift their crests to heaven, uplifting their helmet-
crests which shone even as shine the hearts of those ¢hat strzve
tn the way of the Lord; their array was like Alexander's iron-
wall,3 and, as is the way of the Prophet’s Law, straight and firm
and strong, as though they were a well-compacted building ;4 and
they became fortunate and successful in accordance with the
saying, They are directed by their Lord, and they shall prosper

In that array no rent was frayed by timid souls ;

Firm was it as the Shahanshah’s resolve, strong as the Faith ;
Their standards brushed against the sky ;

Verily we have granted thee certain victory.®

Obeying the cautions of prudence, we imitated the ghazis of
Rim? by posting matchlockmen (¢ufanchian) and cannoneers

another in front of us; in fact, Islaim’s army was so arrayed and
so steadfast that primal Intelligence ® and the firmament (‘ag/-c-
pir u charkh-t-asir) applauded the marshalling thereof. To
effect this arrangement and organization, Nizamu’d-din ‘Ali
Khalifa, the pillar of the Imperial fortune, exerted himself

one in each foot and one in its bill; and these stones they threw down upon the
heads of Abraha’s men, certainly killing every one they struck.’ The rest were
swept away by a flood or perished by a plague, Abraha alone reaching Senaa, where
he also died” [Erskine]. The above is taken from Sale’s note to the 105 chapter of
the Qoran, entitled ‘‘ the Elephant ”.

t Ahmad may be a nephew of Visuf of the same agnomen (Index s.77.).

? T have not discovered the name of this old servant or the meaning of his seeming-
sobriquet, Hindi. As a gachin he will have been a Mughil or Turk. The circum-
stance of his service with a son of Mahmiid Afiran-shahi (down to 905 AH.) makes it
possible that he drew his name in his youth from the tract s.e. of Mahmiid’s Hisar
territory which has been known as Little Hind (Index s.%. Hind). This is however
conjecture merely. Another suggestion is that as Azzda can mean dlack, it may
stand for the common garé of the Turks e.g. Qara Barlas, Black Barlas.

3 I am uncertain whether Qara-qiizi is the name of a place, or the jesting sobriquet
of more than one meaning it can be.

It would be surprising to find such an official sent as envoy to “Iraq, as Asad was both
before and after he fought at Kanwa.

those of my note on the meaning of the words (Index s.7. Muh. ‘Ali). The title

(g. The flanking parties.)

For the flank-movement (¢#ghama) of the right wing there
were posted two of the most trusted of the household retainers,
Tardika* and Malik Qasim the brother of Baba Qashqa, with
a body of Mughils; for the flank-movement of the left wing
were the two trusted chiefs Mimin Ataka and Rustam Turkman,
leading a body of special troops.

(h. The Chief of the Staff.)

The pillar of royal retainers, the perfect in loyalty, the cream
of privy-counsellors, Nizdmu’d-din Sultan Muhammad Bakhshi,
after posting the ghazis of Islam, came to receive the royal
commands. He despatched adjutants (¢awdchz) and messengers
(yasawal) in various directions to convey imperative orders
concerning the marshalling of the troops to the great sultans
and amirs. And when the Commanders had taken up their
positions, an imperative order was given that none should quit
his post or, uncommanded, stretch forth his arm to fight.

(2. The battle.)

One watch? of the afore-mentioned day had elapsed when the
opposing forces approached each other and the battle began.
As Light opposes Darkness, so did the centres of the two
armies oppose one another. Fighting began on the right and
left wings, such fighting as shook the Earth and filled highest
Heaven with clangour.

The left wing of the ill-fated pagans advanced against the
right wing of the Faith-garbed troops of Islam and charged
down on Khusrau Kikildash and Baba Qashqa’s brother Malik
Qasim. The most glorious and most upright brother Chin-timir
Sultan, obeying orders, went to reinforce them and, engaging in
the conflict with bold attack, bore the pagans back almost to
the rear of their centre. Guerdon was made for the brother's
glorious fame. The marvel of the Age, Mustafa of Riim, had
his post in the centre (of the right wing) where was the exalted
son, upright and fortunate, the object of the favourable regard of

Rim had the carts (avabahad)* brought forward and broke the
ranks of pagans with matchlock and culverin dark like their
hearts (?).2_ In the thick of the fight, the most glorious brother
Qasim-i-husain Sultan and the pillars of royal retainers, Nizamu’d-
din Ahmad-i-yisuf and Qawadm Beg, obeying orders, hastened
to their help. And since band after band of pagan troops
followed each other to help their men, so we, in our turn, sent
the trusted in the State, the glory of the Faith, Hindi Beg, and,
after him, the pillars of the nobility, Muhammadi Kikildash

the pure in fidelity, ‘Abdu’l-lah the librarian, and after these, the
pillar of the nobles, Dost the Lord-of-the-Gate, and Muhammad
Khalil the master-gelder (akhta-begi).3

The pagan right wing made repeated and desperate attack on
the left wing of the army of Islam, falling furiously on the holy
watriors, possessors of salvation, but each time was made to
turn back or, smitten with the arrows of victory, was made to
descend into Hell, the house of perdition; they shall be thrown to

trusty amongst the nobles, Mimin Ataka and Rustam Turkman

discharged against a hill, broad of base and high of summit, it

discharged at the iron-clad fortress of the pagan ranks and
by this discharge of stones, and abundance of culverins and
matchlocks (?) 3 destroyed many of the builded bodies of the
pagans. The matchlockmen of the royal centre, in obedience
to orders, going from behind the carts into the midst of the
battle, each one of them made many a pagan taste of the poison
of death. The foot-soldiers, going into a most dangerous place,
made their names to be blazoned amongst those of the forest-
tigers (ze. heroes) of valour and the champions in the field of
manly deeds. Just at this time came an order from his
Majesty the Khaqan that the carts of the centre should be
advanced; and the gracious royal soul (ze. Babur) moved
towards the pagan soldiers, Victory and Fortune on his right,
Prestige and Conquest on his left. On witnessing this event,
the victorious troops followed from all sides; the whole surging
ocean of the army rose in mighty waves ; the courage of all the
crocodiles 4 of that ocean was manifested by the strength of their
deeds ; an obscuring cloud of dust o’erspread the sky (?). The
dust that gathered over the battle-field was traversed by the
lightning-flashes of the sword ; the Sun’s face was shorn of light
as is a mirror’s back; the striker and the struck, the victor and

lost. The Wizard of Time produced such a night that its only
planets were arrows,5 its only constellations of fixed stars were

the steadfast squadrons.

At the moment when the holy warriors were heedlessly flinging
away their lives, they heard a secret voice say, Be not dismayed,
neither be grieved, for, tf ye belteve, ye shall be exalted above the
unbeltevers,* and from the infallible Informer heard the joyful
words, Assistance ts from God, and a speedy victory! And do
thou bear glad tidings to true believers? Then they fought with
such delight that the plaudits of the saints of the Holy Assembly
reached them and the angels from near the Throne, fluttered
round their heads like moths. Between the first and second
Prayers, there was such blaze of combat that the flames thereof
raised standards above the heavens, and the right and left of
the army of Islam rolled back the left and right of the doomed
infidels in one mass upon their centre.

When signs were manifest of the victory of the Strivers and
of the up-rearing of the standards of Islam, those accursed
infidels and wicked unbelievers remained for one hour confounded.
At length, their hearts abandoning life, they fell upon the right
and left of our centre. Their attack on the left was the more
vigorous and there they approached furthest, but the holy warriors,
their minds set on the reward, planted shoots (zal) of arrows
in the field of the breast of each one of them, and, such being
their gloomy fate, overthrew them. In this state of affairs, the
breezes of victory and fortune blew over the meadow of our
happy Nawab, and brought the good news, Verdly we have
granted thee a manifest victory3 And Victory the beautiful

(7. Hindi chiefs killed in the battle.)

Hasan Khan of Miwat was enrolled in the list of the dead by
the force of a matchlock (zard-c-tufak) ; most of those headstrong
chiefs of tribes were slain likewise, and ended their days by
arrow and matchlock (¢ir u tufak). Of their number was Rawal
Udi Singh of Bagar,! ruler (wa/z) of the Dungarpiir country, who
had 12,000 horse, Rai Chandraban Chuhan who had 4,000 horse,
Bhipat Rao son of that Salahu’d-din already mentioned, who
was lord of Chandiri and had 6,000 horse, Manik-chand Chaihan
and Dilpat Rao who had each 4,000 horse, Kankii (or Gangii)
and Karm Singh and Dankisi (?)? who had each 3,000 horse, and
a number of others, each one of whom was leader of a great
command, a splendid and magnificent chieftain. All these trod
the road to Hell, removing from this house of clay to the pit of
perdition. The enemy’s country (daru’/-harb) was full, as Hell
is full, of wounded who had died on the road. The lowest pit
was gorged with miscreants who had surrendered their souls to
the lord of Hell. In whatever direction one from the army of
Islam hastened, he found everywhere a self-willed one dead ;
whatever march the illustrious camp made in the wake of the
fugitives, it found no foot-space without its prostrate foe.

MINOR SEQUELS OF VICTORY.

(a. Babur assumes the title of Ghazi.)

After this success Ghazi (Victor in a Holy-war) was written
amongst the royal titles.

t This passage, entered in some MSS. as if verse, is made up of Qoran, cap. 17,
v. 49, cap. 33, v. 38, and cap. 3, v. 122. \
2 As the day of battle was Jumada II. 13th (March 16th), the Fath-ndma was
ready and dated twelve days after that battle. It was started for Kabul on Rajab9th _
(April 11th). Something may be said here appropriately about the surmise contained
in Dr. Ilminsky’s Preface and M. de Courteille’s note to A/émozres ii, 443 and 450, to
the effect that Babur wrote a plain account of the battle of Kanwa and for this in his
narrative substituted Shaikh Zain’s Kath-ndma, and that the plain account has been
preserved in Kehr’s Babur-nama volume [whence Ilminsky reproduced it, it was
translated by M. de Courteille and became known as a ‘‘ Fragment” of Baburiana].
Almost certainly both scholars would have judged adversely of their suggestion by
the light of to-day’s easier research. The following considerations making against its

value, may be set down :—

(1) There is no sign that Babur ever wrote a plain account of the battle or any
account of it. There is against his doing so his statement that he inserts Shaikh
Zain’s Fath-nadma because it gives particulars. If he had written any account, it would
be found preceding the /ath-ndma, as his account of his renunciation of wine precedes
Shaikh Zain’s Harman announcing the act.

(2) Moreover, the ‘‘ Fragment” cannot be described as a plain account such as
would harmonize with Babur’s style ; it is in truth highly rhetorical, though less so
as Shaikh Zain’s.

(3) The ‘‘ Fragment” begins with a quotation from the Babur-ndma (f.3106 and n.),
skips a good deal of Babur’s matter preliminary to the battle, and passes on with what
there can be no doubt is a translation in inferior Turki of the 44ar-nama account.

(4) The whole of the extra matter is seen to be continuous and not fragmentary,
if it is collated with the chapter in which Abi’l-fazl describes the battle, its sequel of
events, the death, character, attainments, and Court of Babur. Down to the death,
it is changed to the first person so as to make Babur seem to write it. The probable
concocter of it is Jahangir.

(5) If the Fragment were Babur’s composition, where was it when ‘Abdu-r-rahim
translated the Batur-xama in 998 AH.-1590 AD. ; where too did Abii’l-fazl find it to
reproduce in the Akéar-ndma?

(6) The source of Abii’l-fazl’s information seems without doubt to be Babur’s own ~
narrative and Shaikh Zain’s Kath-ndma. There are many significant resemblances
between the two rhetoricians’ metaphors and details selected.

(7) A good deal might be said of the dissimilarities between Babur’s diction and that
of the ‘‘ Fragment”. But this is needless in face of the larger and more circumstantial
objections already mentioned.

(For a fuller account of the ‘‘ Fragment” see JRAS. Jan. 1906 pp. 81, 85 and
1908 p.75 ff.)

the following quatrain :—*

For Islim’s sake, I wandered in the wilds,
Prepared for war with pagans and Hindis,

Resolved myself to meet the martyr’s death.
Thanks be to God! a ghazt I became.

(6. Chronograms of the victory.)

Shaikh Zain had found (apib atdi) the words Fath-t-padshah-
2-islam 3 (Victory of the Padshah of the Faith) to be a chronogram
of the victory. Mir Gesii, one of the people come from Kabul,
had also found these same words to be a chronogram, had
composed them in a quatrain and sent this to me. It was
a coincidence that Shaikh Zain and Mir Gesiti should bring
forward precisely the same words in the quatrains they composed
to embellish their discoveries.4 Once before when Shaikh Zain
found the date of the victory at Dibalpir in the words Wasat-
t-shahr Rabi‘u'l-awwals (Middle of the month Rabi‘ I.), Mir
Gesi had found it in the very same words.

* Tughraé means an imperial signature also, but would Babur sign Shaikh Zain’s
Fath-t-ndma? Hisautograph verse at the end of the Rampar Diwan has his signature
following it. He is likely to have signed this verse. Cf. App. Q. [Erskine notes
that titles were written on the back of despatches, an unlikely place for the quatrain,
one surmises. ] ,

? This is in the Rampur diwan (E.D.R. Plate 17). Dr. E. Denison Ross points
out (p.17 n.) that in the 2nd line the Hai. Codex varies from the Diwan. The MS.

perhaps due to a change of scribe. E

3 These words by adjad yield 933. From Babur’s use of the pluperfect tense,
I think it may be inferred that (my) Sections a and 4 are an attachment to the Fath-
nama, entered with it at a somewhat later date.

4 My translation of this puzzling sentence is tentative only.

5 This statement shews that the Dibalpir affair occurred in one of the B.N. gaps,
and in 930AH. The words make 330 by aéjad. It may be noted here that on
f.3126 and notes there are remarks concerning whether Babur’s remission of the
tamghd was contingent on his winning at Kanwa. If the remission had been delayed
until his victory was won, it would have found fitting mention with the other sequels
of victory chronicled above ; as it is not with these sequels, it may be accepted as an
absolute remission, proclaimed before the fight. The point was a little uncertain
Owing to the seemingly somewhat deferred insertion in Babur’s narrative of Shaikh
Zain’s Farman.

(d. Bidna visited.)

(March 20th) Marching on from that ground, and after halting
on two nights, we reached Biadna (Sunday, Jumada II. 17th).
Countless numbers of the bodies of pagans and apostates * who
had fallen in their flight, lay on the road as far as Biana, indeed
as far as Aliir and Miwat.?

(e. Discussion of plans.)

On our return to camp, I summoned the Turk amirs and the
amirs of Hind to a consultation about moving into the Pagan
(Sanga)’s country ; the plan was given up because of the little
water and much heat on the road.

(f. Miwiat.)

Near Dihli lies the Miwat country which yields revenue of
3 or 4 &rars.3 Hasan Khan Miwati+ and his ancestors one
after another had ruled it with absolute sway for a hundred
years or two. They must have made5 imperfect submission to
the Dihli Sultans ; the Sultans of Hind,® whether because their
own dominions were wide, or because their opportunity was
narrow, or because of the Miwat hill-country,”? did not turn
in the Miwat direction, did not establish order in it, but just

* Babur so-calls both Hasan and his followers, presumably because they followed
their race sympathies, as of Rajpit origin, and fought against co-religionists. Though
Hasan’s subjects, Meos, were nominally Muhammadans, it appears that they practised
some Hindu customs. For an account of Miwat, see Gazetteer of Ulwur (Alwar,
Alir) by Major P. W. Powlett.

? Alwar being in Miwat, Babur may mean that bodies were found beyond that
ae in the main portion of the Miwat country which lies north of Alwar towards

ihli.

3 Major Powlett speaking (p.9) of the revenue Miwat paid to Babur, quotes Thomas
as saying that the coins stated in Babur’s Revenue Accounts, vz. 169,81,000 ¢ankas
were probably Sikandari ¢azzkas, or Rs. 8,490, 50.

4 This word appears to have been restricted in its use to the Khan-zadas of the ruling
house in Miwat, and was not used for their subjects, the Meos (Powlett 1c. Cap. I.).
The uses of ‘‘ Miwati” and ‘‘Meo” suggest something analogous with those of
*“Chaghatai” and ‘‘Mughil” in Babur’s time. The resemblance includes mutual
dislike and distrust (Powlett /.c.).

5 gilirlar atkan dur. This presumptive past tense is frequently used by the cautious
Babur. I quote it here and ina few places near-following because it supports Shaw’s
statement that in it the use of aikdn (ian) reduces the positive affirmation of the
perfect to presumption or rumour. With this statement all grammarians are not
agreed ; it is fully supported by the Babur-nama.

® Contrast here is suggested between Sultans of Dihli & Hind ; is it between the
greater Turks with whom Babur classes himself immediately below as a conqueror
of Hind, and the Ladi Sultans of Dihli?

7 The strength of the Tijara hills towards Dihli is historical (Powlett /.¢. p. 132).

put up with this amount of (imperfect) submission. For our
own part, we did after the fashion of earlier Sultans; having
conquered Hind, we shewed favour to Hasan Khan, but that
thankless and heathenish apostate disregarded our kindness
and benefits, was not grateful for favour and promotion, but
became the mover of all disturbance and the cause of all
misdoing.

When, as has been mentioned, we abandoned the plan
(against Rana Sanga), we moved to subdue Miwat. Having
made 4 night-halts on the way, we dismounted on the bank
of the Manas-ni* 6 kurohs (12 m.) from Alir, the present seat
of government in Miwat. Hasan Khan and his forefathers must
have had their seat? in Tijara, but when I turned towards
Hindistan, beat Pahar (or Bihar) Khan and took Lahor and
Dibalpir (930AH.-1524AD.), he bethought himself betimes and
busied himself for a residence (‘¢a@rat) in Fort Altir (Alwar).

His trusted man, Karm-chand by name, who had come from
him to me in Agra when his son (Nahar ze. Tiger) was with me
there,3 came now from that son’s presence in Alir and asked ~

conveying letters of royal favour, and returned bringing Nahar
Khan who was restored to favour and received Jarganas worth
several /aks for his support.

(g. Rewards to officers.)

Thinking, “What good work Khusrau did in the battle!”
I named him for Alir and gave him 50 /aks for his support,
but unluckily for himself, he put on airs and did not accept
this. Later on it [Ahwud, itself] came to be known that
Chin-timtr must have done4 that work; guerdon was made

of 50 Zaks for his support.

Alir and an allowance of 15 /aks was bestowed on Tardika
(or, Tardi yakka) who in the flanking-party of the right-hand

treasury were bestowed on Humayin.

(4. Alwar visited.)

(April 13th) Marching from that camp on Wednesday the
Ist of the month of Rajab, we came to within 2 kurohs (4 m.) of
Alir. I went to see the fort, there spent the night, and next
day went back to camp.

(2. Leave given to various followers.)

When the oath before-mentioned? was given to great and
small before the Holy-battle with Rana Sanga, it had been
mentioned? that there would be nothing to hinder leave after
this victory, and that leave would be given to anyone wishing
to go away (from Hindiistan). Most of Humayiin’s men were
from Badakhshan or elsewhere on that side (of Hindi-kish);
they had never before been of an army led out for even a month
or two; there had been weakness amongst them before the
fight ; on these accounts and also because Kabul was empty of
troops, it was now decided to give Humfayin leave for Kabul.

(April 11th) Leaving the matter at this, we marched from
Alir on Thursday the 9th of Rajab, did 4 or 5 Aurohs (8-10 m.)
and dismounted on the bank of the Manas-water.

Mahdi Khwaja also had many discomforts ; he too was given
leave for Kabul. The military-collectorate of Biana [he held]
was bestowed on Dost Lord-of-the-gate, and, as previously
Etawa had been named for Mahdi Khwaja,3 Mahdi Khwaja’s
son Jafar Khwaja was sent there in his father’s place when
(later) Qutb Khan abandoned it and went off.4

(jy. Despatch of the Letter-of-victory.)

Because of the leave given to Humayin, two or three days
were spent on this ground. From it Mimin-i-‘ali the messenger
(tawach?) was sent off for Kabul with the Fath-nama.)

(k. Excursions and return to Agra.)

Praise had been heard of the Firizpir-spring and of the
great lake of Kitila.t Leaving the camp on that same ground,
I rode out on Sunday (Rajab 12th-April 14th) both to visit
these places and to set Humayiin on his way. After visiting
Firiizpir and its spring on that same day, ma’juin was eaten.
In the valley where the spring rises, oleanders (kanir) were
in bloom; the place is not without charm but is over-praised.
I ordered a reservoir of hewn stone, 10 by 10? to be made
where the water widened, spent the night in that valley, next
day rode on and visited the Kitila lake. It is surrounded by
mountain-skirts. The Manas-ni is heard-say to go into it.3
It is a very large lake, from its one side the other side is not
well seen. In the middle of it is rising ground. At its sides
are many small boats, by going off in which the villagers living
near it are said to escape from any tumult or disturbance.
Even on our arrival a few people went in them to the middle of
the lake.

On our way back from the lake, we dismounted in Humayin’s
camp. There we rested and ate food, and after having put
robes of honour on him and his begs, bade him farewell at
the Bed-time Prayer, and rode on. We slept for a little at some
place on the road, at shoot of day passed through the pargana
of Khari, again slept a little, and at length got to our camp

* The town of Firizpiir is commonly known as Firizpiir-jhirka (Firizpir of the
spring), from a small perennial stream which issues from a number of fissures in the
rocks bordering the road through a pass in the Miwat hills which leads from the town
vid Tijara to Rewari (G. of Gurgaon, p.249). In Abi’l-fazl’s day there was a Hindi
shrine of Mahadeo near the spring, which is still a place of annual pilgrimage. The
Kitila lake is called Kotla-yhz/ in the G. of G. (p.7). Itextends now 3m. by 24 m.
varying in size with the season ; in Abi’l-fazl’s day it was 4 4os(8m.)round. It lies
partly in the district of Nah, partly in Gurgaon, where the two tracts join at the foot
of the Alwar hills.

* This is the frequently mentioned size for reservoirs ; the measure here is probably
the gdri, ctr. a yard.

_> Babur does not state it as a fact known to himself that the Manas-ni falls into the
Katila lake ; it did so formerly, but now does not, tradition assigning a cause for the
change (G. of G. p.6). He uses the hear-say tense, 4irar aimish.

which had dismounted at Toda-(bhim).' After leaving Toda,
we dismounted at Sinkar; there Hasan Khan Miwdazi’s son
Nahar Khan escaped from ‘Abdu’r-rahim’s charge.

Going on from that place, we halted one night, then
dismounted at a spring situated on the bill of a mountain
between Busawar and Chausa? (or Jiisa); there awnings were
set up and we committed the sin of ma’ju#n. When the army
had passed by this spring, Tardi Beg £Aaksar had praised it ; he
(or we) had come and seen it from on horse-back (sar-ashg7)
and passed on. It is a perfect spring. In Hindiistan where
there are never running-waters,3 people seek out the springs
themselves. The rare springs that are found, come oozing
drop by drop (ad-zih) out of the ground, not bubbling up
like springs of those lands. From this spring comes about
a half-mill-water. It bubbles up on the hill-skirt ; meadows
lie round it; it is very beautiful. I ordered an octagonal
reservoir of hewn stone made above it. While we were at the
border of the spring, under the soothing influence of ma’jin,
Tardi Beg, contending for its surpassing beauty, said again and
again, (Perséan) “Since I am celebrating the beauty of the
place,° a name ought to be settled for it”. ‘Abdu’l-lah said, “It
must be called the Royal-spring approved of by Tardi Beg.”
This saying caused much joke and laughter.

Dost Lord-of-the-gate coming up from Biana, waited on me
at this spring-head. Leaving this place, we visited Biana again,
went on to Sikri, dismounted there at the side of a garden which
had been ordered made, stayed two days supervising the garden,
and on Thursday the 23rd of Rajab (Afrz/ 25th), reached Agra.

(x. Appointments and dispersion for the Rains.)

After the treasure had been shared out,? Rana Sanga’s great
affair intervened before districts and parganas were apportioned.
During the respite now from Holy-war against the Pagan

it was settled for every-one to go to his pargana, get equipment
ready, and be present when the Rains were over.

(rv. Lines addressed to deserting friends.)

A little fragment? had been composed suiting the state of
those who had gone away during the past year ; I now addressed
it to Mulla ‘Ali Khan and sent it to him by Tardi Beg. It is
as follows :—?

Ah you who have gone from this country of Hind,
Aware for yourselves of its woe and its pain,

With longing desire for Kabul’s fine air,

You went hot-foot forth out of Hind.

The pleasure you looked for you will have found there
With sociable ease and charm and delight ;

As for us, God be thanked ! we still are alive,

In spite of much pain and unending distress ;
Pleasures of sense and bodily toil

Have been passed-by by you, passed-by too by us.

(s. Of the Ramzan Feast.)

Ramzan was spent this year with ablution and ¢arawz#3 in
the Garden-of-eight-paradises. Since my 11th year I had not
kept the Ramzan Feast for two successive years in the same
place; last year I had kept it in Agra; this year, saying, “Don’t
break the rule!” I went on the last day of the month to keep
it in Sikri. Tents were set up on a stone platform made on
the n.e. side of the Garden-of-victory which is now being laid
out at Sikri, and in them the Feast was held.4

(4. Playing cards.)

The night we left Agra Mir ‘Ali the armourer was sent to
Shah Hasan (Arghiin) in Tatta to take him playing-cards
[ganjifa] he much liked and had asked for.5

the meaning of ll.4 and 10. I am not sure that what in most MSS. ends line 4, vz.
ail dam, should not be read as ad/im, death ; this is allowed by Plate 14a where for
space the word is divided and may be alam. To read ailiim and that the deserters
fled from the death in Hind they were anxious about, has an answering phrase in ‘‘we
still are alive ”. Li. 9 and 10 perhaps mean that in the things named all have done
alike. [Ilminsky reads £4dir nafsi for the elsewhere hazz-nafsi.|

(u. Illness and a tour.)

(August 3rd) On Sunday the 5th of Zi’l-qa‘da I fell ill; the
illness lasted 17 days.

(August 24th) On Friday the 24th of the same month we
set out to visit Dilpir. That night I slept at a place half-way ;
reached Sikandar’s dam?! at dawn, and dismounted there.

At the end of the hill below the dam the rock is of building-
stone. I had Ustad Shah Muhammad the stone-cutter brought
and gave him an order that if a house could be cut all in one
piece in that rock, it was to be done, but that if the rock were
too low for a residence (‘cszaraz), it was to be levelled and have
a reservoir, all in one piece, cut out of it.

From Dilpir we went on to visit Bari. Next morning
(August 26th) 1 rode out from Bari through the hills between
it and the Chambal-river in order to view the river. This done
I went back to Bari. In these hills we saw the ebony-tree, the
fruit of which people call zzzd#. It is said that there are white
ebony-trees also and that most ebony-trees in these hills are of
this kind.2 On leaving Bari we went to Sikri; we reached
Agra on the 29th of the same month (August 28th).

? There is some uncertainty about these names and also as to which adversary
crossed the river. The sentence which, I think, shews, by its plural verb, that
Huméyin left two men and, by its co-ordinate participles, that it was they crossed
the river, is as follows :—(Darwish and Yusuf, understood) Quté Sirwani-ni u bir

and 44sié are grammatically referable to the same subject, [whatever was the fact
about the crossing].

Sambhal, east of the Ganges.

(f. Holy-war against Chandiri.)

(Dec. oth) After returning from Sikri we started on Monday
night the 14th of the first Rabi‘? with the intention of making
Holy-war against Chandiri, did as much as 3 Aurohs (6m.) and
dismounted in Jalisir.2 After staying there two days for people
to equip and array, we marched on Thursday (Dec. 12¢h—
Rabi‘ I. 17th) and dismounted at Anwar. I left Anwar by boat,
and disembarked beyond Chandwar.3

(Dec. 23rd) Advancing march by march, we dismounted at
the Kanar-passage 4 on Monday the 28th.

(Dec. 26th) On Thursday the 2nd of the latter Rabi‘ I crossed
the river ; there was 4 or 5 days delay on one bank or the other
before the army got across. On those days we went more than
once on board a boat and ate ma’7uin. The junction of the river
Chambal is between one and two kurohs (2+4 m.) above the
Kanar-passage ; on Friday I went into a boat on the Chambal,
passed the junction and so to camp:

Though there had been no clear proof of Shaikh Bayazid’s
hostility, yet his misconduct and action made it certain that he
had hostile intentions. On account of this Muhammad ‘Ali
Jangjang was detached from the army and sent to bring
together from Qaniijj Muhammad Sl. Mirza and the sultans and
amirs of that neighbourhood, such as Qasim-i-husain Sultan,
Bi-khiib (or, Ni-khib) Sultan, Malik Qasim, Kiki, Abi’l-
muhammad the lancer, and Miniichihr Khan with his elder
and younger brethren and Darya-khanis, so that they might
move against the hostile Afghans. They were to invite Shaikh
Bayazid to go with them; if he came frankly, they were to take
him along; if not, were to drive him off. Muhammad ‘Ali

Jalisir ; no question of distance would prevent him from making the two journeys

Agra and Anwar; as it was 6m. from Agra, the only mapped place having

important southward dip of the Jumna below Agra. Chandwar is 25 m. east of Agra,

Rabi‘ we dismounted within a Auroh of Kalpi. Baba Sl. came
to wait on me in this camp; he is a son of Khalil Sl. who is
a younger brother of the full-blood of Sl. Said Khan. Last
year he fled from his elder brother * but, repenting himself, went
back from the Andar-ab border ; when he neared Kashghar, The

A dam has been thrown across between hills on the south-east
of it, and thusa large lake made, perhaps 5 or 6 kurohs (10-12 m.)
round. Thislake encloses Kachwa on three sides ; on the north-
west a space of ground is kept dry ;* here, therefore is its Gate.
On the lake are a great many very small boats, able to hold
3 or 4 persons ; in these the inhabitants go out on the lake, if
they have to flee. There are two other lakes before Kachwa is
reached, smaller than its own and, like that, made by throwing
a dam across between hills.

of Gwalior (i, 247), which is situated in 24° 58’ N. and 77° 57’ E. Each of the three
names is of a place standing on a lake ; Ibn Batiita’s lake was a league (4m.) long,
Babur’s about 11 miles round ; Luard mentions no lake, but the Jzdzan Atlas marks
one quite close to Kadwaha of such form as to seem to have a tongue of land jutting
into it from the north-west, and thus suiting Babur’s description of the site of
Kachwa. Again,—Ibn Batita writes of Kajwarra as having, round its lake, idol-
temples ; Luard says of Kadwaha that it has four idol-temples standing and nine in
ruins ; there may be hinted something special about Babur’s Kachwa by his remark
that he encouraged its people, and this speciality may be interaction between
Muhammadanism and Hinditism serving here for the purpose of identification. For
Ibn Batiita writes of the people of Kajwarra that they were jogis, yellowed by
asceticism, wearing their hair long and matted, and having Muhammadan followers
who desired to learn their (occult ?) secrets. If the same interaction existed in
Babur’s day, the Muhammadan following of the Hindii ascetics may well have been
the special circumstance which led him to promise protection to those Hindiis, even
when he was out for Holy-war. It has to be remembered of Chandiri, the nearest
powerful neighbour of Kadwaha, that though Babur’s capture makes a vivid picture
of Hindiiism in it, it had been under Muhammadan rulers down to a relatively short
time before his conquest. The sagis of Kachwa could point to long-standing relations
of tolerance by the Chandiri Governors ; this, with their Muhammadan following,
explains the encouragement Babur gave them, and helps to identify Kachwa with
Kajarra. It may be observed that Babur was familiar with the interaction of the two
creeds, witness his ‘‘ apostates”, mostly Muhammadans following Hindi customs,
witness too, for the persistent fact, the reports of District-officers under the British
Ri. Again,—a further circumstance helping to identify Kajwarra, Kachwa and
Kadwaha is that these are names of the last important station the traveller and the
soldier, as well perhaps as the modern wayfarer, stays in before reaching Chandiri.
The importance of Kajwarra is shewn by Ibn Batita, and of Kadwaha by its being
a mahall in Akbar’s sarkar of Bayawan of the s#éa of Agra. Again,—Kadwaha is
the place nearest to Chandiri about which Babur’s difficulties as to intermediate road
and jungle would arise. That intermediate road takes off the main one a little south
of Kadwaha and runs through what looks like a narrow valley and broken country
down to Bhamor, Bhuranpir and Chandiri. Again,—no bar to identification of the
three names is placed by their differences of form, in consideration of the vicissitudes
they have weathered in tongue, script, and transliteration. There is some ground,
T believe, for surmising that their common source is ajzr, the date-fruit. [I am
indebted to my husband for the help derived from Ibn Batiita, traced by him in
Sanguinetti’s trs. iv, 33, and S. Lee’s trs. p. 162.]

(Two places similar in name to Kachwa, and situated on Babur’s route wz, Kocha
near Jhansi, and Kuchoowa north of Kadwaha (Sheet 69 S. W.) are unsuitable for his
“*Kachwa”, the first because too near Bandir to suit his itinerary, the second
because too far from the turn off the main-road mentioned above, because it has no
lake, and has not the help in identification detailed above of Kadwaha. )

(Jan. 18th) We waited a day in Kachwa in order to appoint
active overseers and a mass of spadesmen to level the road and
cut jungle down, so that the carts and mortar * might pass along
it easily. Between Kachwa and Chandiri the country is jungly.

(Jan. 19th—Rabi' II. 26th) After leaving Kachwa we halted
one night, passed the Burhanpir-water (Bhuranpir)? and dis-

mounted within 3 kuvohs (6 m.) of Chandiri.

(é. Chandiri and tts capture.)

The citadel of Chandiri stands on a hill; below it are the
town (skahr) and outer-fort (¢ash-gurghan), and below these is
the level road along which carts pass.3 When we left Burhanpur
(Jan. roth) we marched for a kuroh below Chandiri for the
convenience of the carts.4

(Jan. 21st) After one night’s halt we dismounted beside Bahjat
Khan’s tank 5 on the top of its dam, on Tuesday the 28th of the
month.

post after post (4aar, baljar),® round the walled town (garghan)

to be Babur’s Burhanpir-water.

3 The bed of the Betwa opposite Chandiri is 1050 ft. above the sea; the walled-
town (gérghdn) of Chandiri is on a table-land 250 ft. higher, and its citadel is 230 ft.
higher again (Cunningham’s Archeological Survey Report, 1871 A.D. ii, 404).

4 The plan of Chandiri illustrating Cunningham’s Report (see last note) allows
surmise about the road taken by Babur, surmise which could become knowledge if
the names of tanks he gives were still known. The courtesy of the Government of”
India allows me to reproduce that plan [Appendix R, Chandiri and Gwalawar),

5 He is said to have been Governor of Chandiri in 1513 AD.

° Here and in similar passages the word m:Yar or m:lchar is found in MSS.
where the meaning is that of T. d#/ar. It is not in any dictionary I have seen ;
Mr. Irvine found it “obscure” and surmised it to mean ‘‘ approach by trenches”,
but this does not suit its uses in the Badur-ndma of a military post, and a rendezvous.
This surmise, containing, as it does, a notion of protection, links m-:/ar in sense
with Ar. malja’. The word needs expert consideration, in order to decide whether
it is to be received into dictionaries, or to be rejected because explicable as the
outcome of unfamiliarity in Persian scribes with T. daar or, more Persico with
narrowed vowels, 4i%/ar. Shaw in his Vocabulary enters baag (ba/jar?), “‘a station
for troops, a rendezvous, see madja’,” thus indicating, it would seem, that he was
aware of difficulty about m:/jar and buljag (buljar?). There appears no doubt of
the existence of a Turki word 4z/jar with the meanings Shaw gives to bayag ; it
could well be formed from the root 4%/, being, whence follows, being in a place,
posted. Afalja has the meaning of a standing-place, as well as those of a refuge
and an asylum; both meanings seem combined in the m:ljar of £.3364, where for

matchlockmen a m:/jar was ordered ‘raised ” ine’: 7
‘Moghuls p.278.) y ered ‘‘raised”. (Cf. Irvine’s Army of the Indian

to centre, right, and left. Ustad ‘Ali-quli chose, for his stone
-discharge, ground that had no fall’ ; overseers and spadesmen
were told off to raise a place (#-/ar) for the mortar to rest on,
and the whole army was ordered to get ready appliances for
taking a fort, mantelets, ladders? and . . . -mantelets (¢éra).3

Formerly Chandiri will have belonged to the Sultans of
Mandat (Mandi). When Sl. Nasiru’d-din passed away,* one
of his sons Sl. Mahmiid who is now holding Mandi, took
possession of it and its neighbouring parts, and another son
called Muhammad Shah laid hands on Chandiri and put it
under S]. Sikandar (L#dz)’s protection, who, in his turn, took
Muhammad Shah’s side and sent him large forces. Muhammad
Shah survived S]. Sikandar and died in S]. Ibrahim’s time, leaving
a very young son called Ahmad Shah whom Sl. Ibrahim drove
out and replaced by a man of hisown. At the time Rana Sanga
led out an army against Sl]. Ibrahim and Ibrahim’s begs turned
against him at Dilpiir, Chandiri fell into the Rana’s hands and
by him was given to Medini [Mindni] Rao5 the greatly-trusted
pagan who was now in it with 4 or 5000 other pagans.

As it was understood there was friendship between Medini

1 yaghda ; Pers. trs. sar-dshid. Babur’s remark seems to show that for effect his
mortar needed to be higher than its object. Presumably it stood on the table-land
north of the citadel.

2 shati. It may be noted that this word, common in accounts of Babur’s sieges,
may explain one our friend the late Mr. William Irvine left undecided (4c. p.278),
wiz. shatur. On p. 281 he states that sarduban is the name of a scaling-ladder and
that Babur mentions scaling ladders more than once. Babur mentions them however
always as shat. Perhaps shatir which, as Mr. Irvine says, seems to be made of
the trunks of trees and to be a siege appliance, is really shat#z u ... (ladder and
. . .) as in the passage under note and on f.2164, some other name of an appliance
following.

3 The word here preceding ¢d#ra has puzzled scribes and translators. I have seen
the following variants in MSS. ;—vékri or tikri, b:kri or y:hri, bikri ox yukri,
bikrai or yitkrai, in each of which the & may stand for g. Various suggestions
might be made as to what the word is, but all involve reading the Persian enclitic z
(forming the adjective) instead of Turki &. Two roots, tig and yiig, afford plausible
explanations of the unknown word ; appliances suiting the case and able to bear
names formed from one or other of these roots are wheeled mantelet, and head-strike
(P. sar-206). That the word is difficult is shewn not only by the variants I have
quoted, but by Erskine’s reading zaukari tura, ‘‘to serve the ¢é#ras,” a requisite not
specified earlier by Babur, and by de Courteille’s paraphrase, /out ce gui est nécessaire
aux touras.

5 He was a Rajpiit who had been prime-minister of S]. Mahmid II. KAilji (son
of Nasiru’d-din) and had rebelled. Babur (like some other writers) spells his name
Mindni, perhaps as he heard it spoken.

Rao and Araish Khan, the latter was sent with Shaikh Giran
to speak to Medini Rao with favour and kindness, and promise
Shamsabad ! in exchange for Chandiri. One or two of his
trusted men got out (?).2, No adjustment of matters was reached,
it is not known whether because Medini Rao did not trust what
was said, or whether because he was buoyed up by delusion
about the strength of the fort.

( Jan. 28th) At dawn on Tuesday the 6th of the first Jumada
we marched from Bahjat Khan’s tank intending to assault
Chandiri. We dismounted at the side of the middle-tank near
the fort.

(y. Bad news.)

On this same morning after reaching that ground, Khalifa
brought a letter or two of which the purport was that the troops
appointed for the East 3 had fought without consideration, been
beaten, abandoned Laknau, and gone to Qanij. Seeing that
Khalifa was much perturbed and alarmed by these news, I said,*
(Persian) “There is no ground for perturbation or alarm ;
nothing comes to pass but what is predestined of God. As
this task (Chandirt) is ahead of us, not a breath must be drawn
about what has been told us. Tomorrow we will assault the
fort ; that done, we shall see what comes.”

(4. Stege of Chandiri, resumed.)

The enemy must have strengthened just the citadel, and have
posted men by twos and threes in the outer-fort for prudence’
sake. That night our men went up from all round; those few
in the outer-fort did not fight ; they fled into the citadel.

tion.” So far I have not found Babur using the verb chigmag metaphorically. It
is his frequent verb to express ‘getting away ”, ‘“ going out of a fort”. It would be
a short step in metaphor to understand here that Medini’s men “got out of it”,

* I.0.217, £.231, inserts here what seems a gloss, ‘‘ 7a in ya Farsi farmida”

Persian to conceal the bad news.

(Jan. 29th) At dawn on Wednesday the 7th of the first
Jumada, we ordered our men to arm, go to their posts, provoke
to fight, and attack each from his place when I rode out with
drum and standard.

I myself, dismissing drum and standard till the fighting should
grow hot, went to amuse myself by watching Ustad ‘Ali-quli’s
stone-discharge.* Nothing was effected by it because his ground
had no fall (ya@ghda) and because the fort-walls, being entirely
of stone, were extremely strong.

That the citadel of Chandiri stands on a hill has been said
already. Down one side of this hill runs a double-walled road
(di-tahz) to water.2 This is the one place for attack ; it had
been assigned as the post of the right and left hands and royal
corps of the centre3 Hurled though assault was from every
side, the greatest force was here brought to bear. Our braves did
not turn back, however much the pagans threw down stones and
flung flaming fire upon them. At length Shahim the centurion 4
got up where the d@#-¢ahi wall touches the wall of the outer fort ;
braves swarmed up in other places ; the d#-tahi was taken.

Not even as much as this did the pagans fight in the citadel ;
when a number of our men swarmed up, they fled in haste.5 In
a little while they came out again, quite naked, and renewed the
fight ; they put many of our men to flight ; they made them fly
(auchurdilar) over the ramparts ; some they cut down and killed.
Why they had gone so suddenly off the walls seems to have
been that they had taken the resolve of those who give up
a place as lost ; they put all their ladies and beauties (s#zratilar)
to death, then, looking themselves to die, came naked out
to fight. Our men attacking, each one from his post, drove
them from the walls whereupon 2 or 300 of them entered
Medini Rao’s house and there almost all killed one another in
this way :—one having taken stand with a sword, the rest

* The J/lustrated London News of July 10th, 1915 (on which day this note is

eagerly stretched out the neck for his blow. Thus went the
greater number to hell.

By God’s grace this renowned fort was captured in 2 or 3 garés*
(cir. an hour), without drum and standard,3 with no hard fighting
done. A pillar of pagan-heads was ordered set up on a hill
north-west of Chandiri. A chronogram of this victory having
been found in the words Fath-z-daru’l-harb+ (Conquest of a hostile
seat), I thus composed them :—

Was for awhile the station Chandiri
Pagan-full, the seat of hostile force ;
By fighting, I vanquished its fort,
The date was Fath-i-darw l-harb.

(2. Further description of Chandiri.)
Chandiri is situated (in) rather good country,5 having much
running-water round about it. Its citadel is on a hill and inside it

* Babur’s account of the siege of Chandiri is incomplete, inasmuch as it says
nothing of the general massacre of pagans he has mentioned on f.272. Khwéafi
Khan records the massacre, saying, that after the fort was surrendered, as was done
on condition of safety for the garrison, from 3 to 4000 pagans were put to death by
Babur’s troops on account of hostility shewn during the evacuation of the fort. The
time assigned to the massacre is previous to the jzhar of 1000 women and children
and the self-slaughter of men in Medini Rao’s house, in which he himself died. It
is not easy to fit the two accounts in ; this might be done, however, by supposing
that a folio of Babur’s MS. was lost, as others seem lost at}the end of the narrative
of this year’s events (g.v.). The lost folio would tell of the surrender, one clearly
affecting the mass of Rajpiit followers and not the chiefs who stood for victory or
death and who may have made sacrifice to honour after hearing of the surrender.
Babur’s narrative in this part certainly reads less consecutive than is usual with him ;
something preceding his account of the 7#ar would improve it, and would serve
another purpose also, since mention of the surrender would fix a term ending the now
too short time of under one hour he assigns as the duration of the fighting. If
a surrender had been mentioned, it would be clear that his ‘‘2 or 3 garés” included
the attacking and taking of the d#-tahi and down to the retreat of the Rajpiits from
the walls. On this Babur’s narrative of the unavailing sacrifice of the chiefs would
follow in due order. Khwafi Khan is more circumstantial than Firishta who says
nothing of surrender or massacre, but states that 6000 men were killed fighting.
Khwafi Khan’s authorities may throw light on the matter, which so far does not
hang well together in any narrative, Babur’s, Firishta’s, or Khwafi Khan’s. One
would like to know what led such a large body of Rajpits to surrender so quickly ;
had they been all through in favour of accepting terms? One wonders, again, why
from 3 to 4000 Rajpits did not put up a better resistance to massacre. Perhaps their
assailants were Turks, stubborn fighters down to 1915 AD.

® For suggestion about the brevity of this period, see last note.

> Clearly, without Babur’s taking part in the fighting.

has a tank cut out of the solid rock. There is another large tank *
at the end of the di-tahz by assaulting which the fort was taken.
All houses in Chandiri, whether of high or low, are built of stone,
those of chiefs being laboriously carved ;? those of the lower
classes are also of stone but are not carved. They are covered in
with stone-slabs instead of with earthen tiles. In front of the
fort are three large tanks made by former governors who threw
dams across and made tanks round about it; their ground lies
high.3 It has a small river (daryacha), Betwa+ by name, which
may be some 3 kurohs (6 m.) from Chandiri itself ; its water is
noted in Hindiistan as excellent and pleasant drinking. It is
a perfect little river (daryd-ghina). In its bed lie piece after
piece of sloping rock (gi@/ar)5 fit for making houses.® Chandiri is

* This is the ‘‘ Kirat-sagar ” of Cunningham’s Plan of Chandiri; it is mentioned
under this name by Luard (/.c. i, 210). ‘* Kirat” represents Kirti or Kirit Singh who
ruled in Gaaliar from 1455 to 1479 AD., there also making a tank (Luard, /.c. i, 232).

* For illustrative photographs see Luard, /.c. voli, part iv.

3 I have taken this sentence to apply to the location of the tanks, but with some
doubt ; they are on the table-land.

4 Babur appears to have written Betwi, this form being in MSS. I have read the
name to be that of the river Betwa which is at a considerable distance from the fort.
But some writers dispraise its waters where Babur praises.

provide slabs for roofing and split easily for building purposes. (See next note.)

° “imarat gilmag munasib. This has been read to mean that the gi@/ar provide

Chanderi is situated in the 25th degree of N. latitude ; de Courteille, ii, 334, Za
hauteur du Capricorne 2 Tchanderi est de 25 degrées. The latitude of Chandiri, it
may be noted, is 24° 43’. It does not appear to me indisputable that what Babur
says here is a statement of latitude. The word judad (or jady) means both Pole-star
and the Sign Capricorn. M. de Courteille translates the quoted sentence as I have
done, but with Capricorn for Pole-star. My acquaintance with such expressions in
French does not allow me to know whether his words are a statement of latitude.
It Occurs to me against this being so, that Babur uses other words when he gives the
latitude of Samarkand (f. 446) ; and also that he has shewn attention to the Pole-star
as a guide on a journey (f. 203, where he uses the more common word Qus). Perhaps
he notes its lower altitude when he is far south, in the way he noted the first rise of
Canopus to his view (f. 125).

We had come to Chandiri meaning, after taking it, to move
against Raising, Bhilsan, and Sarangpiir, pagan lands depen-
dent on the pagan Salahu’d-din, and, these taken, to move on
Rana Sanga in Chitir. But as that bad news had come, the
begs were summoned, matters were discussed, and decision made
that the proper course was first to see to the rebellion of those
malignants. Chandiri was given to the Ahmad Shah already
mentioned, a grandson of SI. Nasiru’d-din ; 50 /aks from it were
made khalsa;* Mulla Apaq was entrusted with its military-
collectorate, and left to reinforce Ahmad Shah with from 2 to
3000 Turks and Hindistanis.

Fol. 336. (Feb. 2nd) This work finished, we marched from Malli Khan’s
tank on Sunday the IIth of the first Jumada, with the intention
of return (north), and dismounted on the bank of the Burhanpiir-
water.

(Feb. 9th) On Sunday again, Yakka Khwaja and Ja‘far Khwaja
were sent from Bandir to fetch boats from Kalpi to the Kanar-
passage.

(Feb. 22nd) On Saturday the 24th of the month we dismounted
at the Kanar-passage, and ordered the army to begin to cross.
(x. Necws of the rebels.)

News came in these days that the expeditionary force? had
abandoned Qanij also and come to Rapri, and that a strong
body of the enemy had assaulted and taken Shamsabad although
Abi’'l-muhammad the lancer must have strengthened it.3 There
was delay of 3 or 4 days on one side or other of the river before
the army got across. Once over, we moved march by march
towards Qanij, sending scouting braves (gasaq yigitlar) ahead
to get news of our opponents. Two or three marches from Qaniij,
news was brought that Ma‘rif’s son had fled on seeing the dark
mass of the news-gatherers, and got away. Biban, Bayazid and
Ma‘riif, on hearing news of us, crossed Gang (Ganges) and seated
themselves on its eastern bank opposite Qaniij, thinking to prevent
our passage.

(0. A bridge made over the Ganges.)

(Feb. 27th) On Thursday the 6th of the latter Jumada we
passed Qaniij and dismounted on the western bank of Gang.
Some of the braves went up and down the river and took boats
by force,t bringing in 30 or 40, large or small. Mir Muhammad
the raftsman was sent to find a place convenient for making
a bridge and to collect requisites for making it. He came back
approving of a place about a kuroh (2 m.) below the camp.
Energetic overseers were told off for the work. Ustad ‘Ali-quli
placed the mortar for his stone-discharge near where the bridge
was to be and shewed himself active in discharging it. Mustafa
Rumi had the culverin-carts crossed over to an island below
the place for the bridge, and from that island began a culverin
-discharge. Excellent matchlock fire was made from a post ?
raised above the bridge. Malik Qasim A7ughil and a very few
men went across the river once or twice and fought excellently
(yakhshilar aurishtilar). With equal boldness Baba Sl. and
Darwish Sl. also crossed, but went with the insufficient number
of from 10 to 15 men; they went after the Evening Prayer and
came back without fighting, with nothing done; they were much
blamed for this crossing of theirs. At last Malik Qasim, grown
bold, attacked the enemy’s camp and, by shooting arrows into
it, drew him out (?);3 he came with a mass of men and an
elephant, fell on Malik Qasim and hurried him off. Malik
Qasim got into a boat, but before it could put off, the elephant
came up and swamped it. In that encounter Malik Qasim.died.

In the days before the bridge was finished Ustad ‘Ali-quli did
good things in stone-discharge (yakhshilar tash aiti), on the first
day discharging 8 stones, on the second 16, and going on equally
well for 3 or 4days. These stones he discharged from the Ghazi
-mortar which is so-called because it was used in the battle with
Rana Sanga the pagan. There had been another and larger
mortar which burst after discharging one stone.t The match-
lockmen made a mass (ga/in) of discharges, bringing down many

(March 11th) On Wednesday the 19th of the latter Jumada
the bridge being almost finished, we marched to its head. The
Afghans must have ridiculed the bridge-making as being far
from completion.?

(March 12th) The bridge being ready on Thursday, a small
body of foot-soldiers and Lahoris went over. Fighting as small
followed.

these divisions had galloped ahead of the rest ; one was dis-
mounted and taken; the horse of the other was struck again
and again, had had enough,3 turned round and when amongst
our men, fell down. On that day 7 or 8 heads were brought
in; many of the enemy had arrow or matchlock wounds.
Fighting went on till the Other Prayer. That night all who
had gone across were made to return ; if (more) had gone over
on that Saturday’s eve,t most of the enemy would probably
have fallen into our hands, but this was in my mind :—Last
year we marched out of Sikri to fight Rana Sanga on Tuesday,
New-year's-day, and crushed that rebel on Saturday ; this year
we had marched to crush these rebels on Wednesday, New-
year’s-day,5 and it would be one of singular things, if we beat
them on Sunday. So thinking, we did not make the rest of

but stood arrayed a long way off.

(Sunday March 15th—Jumada II. 23rd) On this day the
carts were taken over, and at this same dawn the army was
ordered to cross. At beat of drum news came from our scouts
that the enemy had fled. Chin-timiir Sl. was ordered to lead
his army in pursuit and the following leaders also were made
pursuers who should move with the Sultan and not go beyond
his word :—Muhammad ‘Ali /ang-jang, Husamu’d-din ‘Ali (son)

The camels were ordered to be taken over at a passage seen
lower down. That Sunday we dismounted on the bank of
standing-water within a kurok of Bangarmawi.t Those ap-
pointed to pursue the Afghans were not doing it well; they
had dismounted in Bangarmawi and were scurrying off at the
Mid-day Prayer of this same Sunday.

(March 16th—Jumada II, 24th) At dawn we dismounted on
the bank of a lake belonging to Bangarmawia.

the river Sird[a ?] ;* let His Majesty send help.” We detached a
reinforcement of 1000 braves under Qaracha.

(March 28th) On Saturday the 7th of Rajab we dismounted
2 or 3 kurohs from Aid above the junction of the Gagar (Gogra)
and Sird[a]. Till today Shaikh Bayazid will have been on the
other side of the Sird[a] opposite Aid, sending letters to the
Sultan and discussing with him, but the Sultan getting to know
his deceitfulness, sent word to Qaracha at the Mid-day Prayer
and made ready to cross the river. On Qaracha’s joining him,
they crossed at once to where were some 50 horsemen with 3 or
4elephants. These men could make no stand ; they fled ; a few
having been dismounted, the heads cut off were sent in.

Following the Sultan there crossed over Bi-khib (var. Ni-khiib)
Sl. and Tardi Beg (the brother) of Qaj Beg, and Baba Chuhra
(the Brave), and Baqi skhaghawal. Those who had crossed first
and gone on, pursued Shaikh Bayazid till the Evening Prayer,
but he flung himself into the jungle and escaped. Chin-timir
dismounted late on the bank of standing-water, rode on at mid-
night after the rebel, went as much as 40 kurohs (80 m.), and
came to where Shaikh Bayazid’s family and relations (z¢sba?)
had been ; they however must have fled. He sent gallopers
off in all directions from that place; Baqi skaghawal and a few
braves drove the enemy like sheep before them, overtook the
family and brought in some Afghan prisoners.

We stayed a few days on that ground (near Aiid) in order to
settle the affairs of Atid. People praised the land lying along
the Sird[a] 7 or 8 kurohs (14-16 m.) above Aid, saying it was
hunting-ground. Mir Muhammad the raftsman was sent out
and returned after looking at the crossings over the Gagar-water
(Gogra) and the Sird[a]-water (Chauka ?).

TRANSLATOR’S NOTE.

Here, in all known texts of the Babur-nama there is a break
of the narrative between April 2nd and Sep. 18th 1528 ap.—
Jumada II. 12th 934 AH. and Muharram 3rd 935 AH., which,
whether intentional or accidental, is unexplained by Babur’s
personal circumstances. It is likely to be due to a loss of pages
from Babur’s autograph manuscript, happening at some time
preceding the making of either of the Persian translations of his
writings and of the Elphinstone and Haidarabad transcripts.
Though such a loss might have occurred easily during the storm
chronicled on f.3764, it seems likely that Babur would then have
become aware of it and have made it good. A more probable
explanation of the loss is the danger run by Humayin’s library
during his exile from rule in Hindistan, at which same time
may well have occurred the seeming loss of the record of 936
and 937 AH.

a. Transactions of the period of the lacuna.

Mr. Erskine notes (A7Zems. p.381n.) that he found the gap in
all MSS. he saw and that historians of Hindistan throw no light
upon the transactions of the period. Much can be gleaned how-
ever as to Babur’s occupations during the 54 months of the /acuna
from his chronicle of 935 AH. which makes several references to
occurrences of “last year” and also allows several inferences to
be drawn. From this source it becomes known that the Afghan
campaign the record of which is broken by the gap, was carried
on and that in its course Babur was at Jiin-pir (f.365), Chausa
(f.3650) and Baksara (f. 366-3664) ; that he swam the Ganges
(f.3666), bestowed Sariin on a Farmiili Shaikh-zada (f.3746 and
f.377), negociated with Rana Sanga’s son Bikramajit (f. 3420),
ordered a Char-bagh laid out (f.340), and was ill for 40 days
(f.3464). It may be inferred too that he visited Dilpir (f. 3530),
recalled ‘Askari (f.339), sent Khwaja Dost-i-khawand on family
affairs to Kabul (f.345), and was much pre-occupied by the

604 TRANSLATOR’S NOTE

disturbed state of Kabul (see his letters to Humayiin and Khwaja
Kalan written in 935 AH.).”

It is not easy to follow the dates of events in 935 AH. because
in many instances only the day of the week or a “next day”
is entered. I am far from sure that one passage at least now
found s.a. 935 AH. does not belong to 934AH. It is not in the
Hai. Codex (where its place would have been on f.3634), and, so
far as I can see, does not fit with the dates of 935AH. It will
be considered with least trouble with its context and my notes
(g.v. £.3634 and ff. 366-3660).

b. Remarks on the lacuna.

One interesting biographical topic is likely to have found
mention in the missing record, vzz. the family difficulties which
led to ‘Askari’s supersession by Kamran in the government of
Multan (f.359).

Another is the light an account of the second illness of 934 AH.
might have thrown on a considerable part of the Collection of
verses already written in Hindiistan and now known to us as the
Rampir Diwan. The Babur-ndma allows the dates of much of
its contents to be known, but there remain poems which seem
prompted by the self-examination of some illness not found in
the B.V. It contains the metrical version of Khwaja ‘Ubaidu’l
-lah’s Walidiyyah of which Babur writes on f.346 and it is dated
Monday Rabi‘ II. 15th 935 AH. (Dec. 29th 1528AD.). I surmise
that the reflective verses following the Walédiyyah belong to the
40 days’ illness of 934AH. ze. were composed in the period of
the lacuna. The Collection, as it is in the “Rampur Diwan”, went
to a friend who was probably Khwaja Kalan ; it may have been
the only such collection made by Babur. No other copy of it
has so far been found. It has the character of an individual gift
with verses specially addressed to its recipient. Any light upon
it which may have vanished with pages of 934.AH. is an appreci-
able loss.

* One historian, Ahmad-i-yadgar states in his 7arikh-7-salatin-t-afaghina that Babur
went to Lahor immediately after his capture of Chandiri, and on his return journey
to Agra suppressed in the Panj-ab a rising of the Mundahar (or, Mandhar) Rajpits.
His date is discredited by Babur’s existing narrative of 934 AH. as also by the absence
in 935 AH. of allusion to either episode. My husband who has considered the matter,
advises me that the Lahor visit may have been made in 936 or early in937AH. [These
area period of which the record is lost or, less probably, was not written. ]

3 ‘Askari was now about 12 years old. He was succeeded in Multan by his elder
brother Kamran, transferred from Qandahar (Index; JRAS. 1908 p. 829 para. (1)].
This transfer, it is safe to say, was due to Babur’s resolve to keep Kabul in his own
hands, a resolve which his letters to Humayiin (f. 348), to Kamran (f. 359), and to
Khwaja Kalan (f. 359) attest, as well as do the movements of his family at this time.
What would make the stronger government of Kamran seem now more ‘‘ for the good
of Multan” than that of the child ‘Askari are the Biliichi incursions, mentioned some-
what later (f. 3554) as having then occurred more than once.

4 This will be his own house in the Garden-of-eight-paradises, the Char-bagh begun
in 932 AH. (August 1526 AD.).

5 To this name Khwand-amir adds Ahmadu’l-haqiri, perhaps a pen-name ; he also
quotes verses of Shihab’s (//abibu’s-siyar lith. ed. iii, 350).

© Khwand-amir’s account of his going into Hindistan is that he left his “ dear
home” (Herat) for Qandahar in mid-Shaww4l 933 AH. (mid-July 1527 Ap.); that
on Jumada I. 1oth 934 aH. (Feb. Ist 1528 ap.) he set out from Qandahar on the
hazardous journey into Hindistan ; and that owing to the distance, heat, setting-in
of the Rains, and breadth of rapid rivers, he was seven months on the way. He
mentions no fellow-travellers, but he gives as the day of his arrival in Agra the one
on which Babur says he presented himself at Court. (For an account of annoyances
and misfortunes to which he was subjected under Aiizbeg rule in Herat see Journal des
Savans, July 1843, pp. 389, 393, Quatremére’s art.)

Rousselet’s L’/nde des Rajas; Lepel Griffin’s Famous Monuments of Central India,

Prayer of Sunday the 5th of the month, went into the fort of
Agra to bid farewell to Fakhr-i-jahan Begim and Khadija-
sultan Begim who were to start for Kabul in a few days, and
got to horse. Muhammad-i-zaman Mirza asked for leave and
stayed behind in Agra. That night we did 3 or 4 Aurohs (6-8 m.)
of the road, dismounted near a large lake (A#/) and there slept.

(Sep. 21st) We got through the Prayer somewhat before
time (Muh. 6th) and rode on, nooned* on the bank of the
Gambfh]ir-water ?, and went on shortly after the Mid-day Prayer.
On the way we ate3 powders mixed with the flour of parched
grain, Mulla Rafi‘ having prepared them for raising the spirits.
They were found very distasteful and unsavoury. Near the Other
Prayer we dismounted a £uroh (2 m.) west of Dilpir, at a place
where a garden and house had been ordered made.5
(c. Work in Dilpir (Dhilpir).)

That place is at the end of a beaked hill,° its beak being of
solid red building-stone (‘c#arat-tash). 1 had ordered the (beak
of the) hill cut down (dressed down ?) to the ground-level and
that if there remained a sufficient height, a house was to be cut
out in it, if not, it was to be levelled and a tank (Aawz) cut out
in its top. As it was not found high enough for a house, Ustad
Shah Muhammad the stone-cutter was ordered to level it and
cut out an octagonal, roofed tank. North of this tank the
ground is thick with trees, mangoes, jaman (Eugenia jambolana),
all sorts of trees; amongst them I had ordered a well made,
10 by 10; it was almost ready ; its water goes to the afore-named
tank. To the north of this tank Sl. Sikandar’s dam is flung across
(the valley) ; on it houses have been built, and above it the waters
of the Rains gather into a great lake. On the east of this lake
is a garden ; I ordered a seat and four-pillared platform (¢@/ar)

to be cut out in the solid rock on that same side, and a mosque
built on the western one.

(Sept. 22nd and 23rd—Muh. 7th and 8th) On account of these
various works, we stayed in Dilpiir on Tuesday and Wednesday.

(a. Journey to Gialiar resumed.)

(Sep. 24th) On Thursday we rode on, crossed the Chambal-
river and made the Mid-day Prayer on its bank, between the
two Prayers (the Mid-day and the Afternoon) bestirred our-
selves to leave that place, passed the Kawari and dismounted.
The Kawari-water being high through rain, we crossed it by
boat, making the horses swim over.

(Sep. 25th) Next day, Friday which was ’Ashir (Muh. roth),
we rode on, took our nooning ata village on the road, and at
the Bed-time Prayer dismounted a #uvoh north of Gialiar, in a
Char-bagh ordered made last year."

(Sep. 26th) Riding on next day after the Mid-day Prayer, we
visited the low hills to the north of Gialiar, and the Praying-
place, went into the fort? through the Gate called Hati-pil
which joins Man-sing’s buildings (‘%ara¢3), and dismounted, close
to the Other Prayer, at those (‘“mdratlar)+ of Raja Bikramajit
in which Rahim-dad 5 had settled himself.

t No order about this Char-bagh is in existing annals of 934 AH. Such order is
likely to have been given after Babur’s return from his operations against the Afghans,
in his account of which the annals of 934 AH. break off.

2 The fort-hill atthe northern end is 300ft. high, at the southern end, 274 ft. ; its
length from north to south is 1? m. ; its breadth varies from 600 ft. opposite the main
entrance (Hati-pil) to 2,800 ft. in the middle opposite the great temple (Sas-bhao).
Cf. Cunningham p. 330 and Appendix R, 27 Joco, for his Plan of Gialiar.

3 This Arabic plural may have been prompted by the greatness and distinction of
Man-sing’s constructions. Cf. Index s.2. begat and baghat.

4 A translation point concerning the (Arabic) word ‘zmdrat¢ is that the words
“palace”, ‘‘ palais”, and ‘‘ residence” used for it respectively by Erskine, de Cour-
teille, and, previous to the Hindistin Section, by myself, are too limited in meaning
to serve for Babur’s uses of it in Hindiistan ; and this (1) because he uses it throughout
his writings for buildings under palatial rank (e.g. those of high and low in Chandiri) ;
(2) because he uses it in Hindistan for non-residential buildings (e.g. for the Badalgarh
outwork, f. 3414, and a Hindi temple zd.) ; and (3) because he uses it for the word
“building” in the term building-stone, f. 3354 and f. 3394. Bzz/ding is the compre-
hensive word under which all his uses of it group. For labouring this point a truism
pleads my excuse, namely, that a man’s vocabulary being characteristic of himself, for
a translator to increase or diminish it is to intrude on his personality, and this the
more when an autobiography is concerned. Hence my search here (as elsewhere) for

To-night I elected to take opium because of ear-ache ; another
reason was the shining of the moon.*

(e. Visit to the Rajas’ palaces.)

(Sep. 27th) Opium sickness gave me much discomfort next
day (Muh. 12th); 1 vomited a good deal. Sickness notwith-
standing, I visited the buildings (‘e#d@ratlar) of Man-sing and
Bikramajit thoroughly. They are wonderful buildings, entirely
of hewn stone, in heavy and unsymmetrical blocks however? Of
all the Rajas’ buildings Man-sing’s is the best and loftiest.3 It
is more elaborately worked on its eastern face than on the others.
This face may be 46 to 50 gavz (yards) high,+ and is entirely of
hewn stone, whitened with plaster$ In parts it is four storeys
high ; the lower two are very dark ; we went through them with

men became disloyal in 935 AH. (1529 AD.) as will be found referred to by Babur.
Jalat Asari supplements Babur’s brief account of their misconduct and Shaikh
Muhammad Ghaus’ mediation in 936 AH. For knowledge of his contribution I am
indebted to my hushand’s perusal of the 7a7ihh-2-Gwaliawar.

* Erskine notes that Indians and Persians regard moonshine as cold but this only
faintly expresses the wide-spread fear of moon-stroke expressed in the Psalm (121 v. 6),
“The Sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the Moon by night.”

textual warrant and perhaps following Erskine, as he says, speaking generally, that he
has done in case of need (Ilminsky’s Preface). Both Erskine and de Courteille,
working, it must be remembered, without the help of detailed modern descriptions and
pictures, took the above words to say that the buildings were scattered and without
symmetry, but they are not scattered and certainly Man-sing’s has symmetr
I surmise that the words quoted above do not refer to the buildings themselves but
the stones of which they are made. T./#& means heavy, and T. dalak [? block ]
means a thing divided off, here a block of stone. Such blocks might be 47 siyag,
#.e. irregular in size. To take the words in this way does not contradict known
circumstances, and is verbally correct.

3 The Rajas’ buildings Babur could compare were Raja Karna (or Kirti)’s [who ruled
from 1454 to 1479 Av.], Raja Man-sing’s [1486 to 1516 ap.], and Raja Bikramajit’s
(1516 to 1526 AD. when he was killed at Panipat].

* The height of the eastern face is 100 ft. and of the western 60 ft. The total length
from north to south of the outside wall is 300 ft. ; the breadth of the residence from
east to west 160ft. The 300 ft. of length appears to be that of the residence and
service-courtyard (Cunningham p. 347 and Plate Ixxxvii).

5 kaj bila agaritib. There can be little doubt that a white pediment would show
up the coloured tiles of the upper part of the palace-walls more than would pale red
sandstone. These tiles were so profuse as to name the building Chit Mandir (Painted
Mandir). Guided by Babur’s statement, Cunningham sought for and found plaster
in crevices of carved work ; from which one surmises that the white coating approved
itself to successors of Man-sing. [It may be noted that the word Mandir is in the
same case for a translator as is ‘Z#drat (f. 3396 n.) since it requires a grouping word
to cover its uses for temple, palace, and less exalted buildings. ]

candles.t On one (or, every) side of this building are five cupolas?
having between each two of them a smaller one, square after the
fashion of Hindistan. On the larger ones are fastened sheets
of gilded copper. On the outside of the walls is painted-tile
work, the semblance of plantain-trees being shewn all round with
green tiles. Ina bastion of the eastern front is the Hati-piil,3
hati being what these people call an elephant, pz/, a gate.
A sculptured image of an elephant with two drivers (/#/-dan) 4
stands at the out-going (chigish) of this Gate ; it is exactly like an
elephant ; from it the gate is called Hati-pil. A window in the
lowest storey where the building has four, looks towards this
elephant and gives a near view of it The cupolas which have
been mentioned above are themselves the topmost stage (murtaba)
of the building ;° the sitting-rooms are on the second storey
(¢abagat), in ahollow even;? they are rather airless places although
Hindistani pains have been taken with them.’ The buildings of
Man-sing’s son Bikramajit are in a central position (arta d@) on
the north side of the fort.2 The son’s buildings do not match
the father’s. He has made a great dome, very dark but growing
lighter if one stays awhile in it.t° Under it is a smaller building

t The lower two storeys are not only backed by solid ground but, except near the
Hati-pil, have the rise of ground in front of them which led Babur to say they were
“even in a pit” (chigar).

2 MSS. vary between ar and dir, every and one, in thissentence. It may be right
to read dir, and apply it only to the eastern facade as that on which there were most
cupolas. There are fewer on the south side, which still stands (Luard’s photo. No. 37).

3 The ground rises steeply from this Gate to an inner one, called Hawa-pil from
the rush of air (Zawa) through it.

4 Cunningham says the riders were the Raja and a driven Perhaps they were a
mahout and his mate. The statue stood to the left on exit (chigish).

5 This window will have been close to the Gate where no mound interferes with
outlook.

© Rooms opening on inner and open courts appear to form the third story of the
residence.

7 T. chiigir, hollow, pit. This storey isdark and unventilated, a condition due to
small windows, absence of through draught, and the adjacent mound. Cunningham
comments on its disadvantages.

Perhaps amongst the pains taken were those demanded for punkhas. I regret that
Erskine’s translation of this passage, so superior to my own in literary merit, does
not suit the Turki original. He worked from the Persian translation, and not only
so, but with a less rigid rule of translation than binds me when working on Babur’s
tpsissima verba (Mems. p.384; Cunningham p. 349; Luard p. 226).

9 The words a#rta da make apt contrast between the outside position of Man-sing’s
buildings which helped to form the fort-wall, and Bikramajit’s which were further in
except perhaps one wall of his courtyard (see Cunningham’s Plate Ixxxiii).

© Cunningham (p. 350) says this was originally a dara-diri, a twelve-doored open
hall, and must have been light. His ‘“‘ originally” points to the view that the hall

into whichno light comes from anyside. When Rahim-dad settled
down in Bikraméajit’s buildings, he made a rather small hall
[Aichikrag talarghina] on the top of this dome.* From Bikra-
méjit’s buildings a road has been made to his father's, a road
such that nothing is seen of it from outside and nothing known
of it inside, a quite enclosed road.?

After visiting these buildings, we rode to a college Rahim-dad
had made by the side of a large tank, there enjoyed a flower-
garden 3 he had laid out, and went late to where the camp was
in the Charbagh.

(f. Rahim-dad's flower-garden.)

Rahim-dad has planted a great numbers of flowers in his garden
(saghcha), many being beautiful red oleanders. In these places
the oleander-flower is peach,t those of Gialiar are beautiful,
deep red. I took some of them to Agra and had them planted
in gardens there. On the south of the garden is a large lake >
where the waters of the Rains gather; on the west of it is
a lofty idol-house,® side by side with which Sl. Shihabu’d-din
Ailtmish (Altamsh) made a Friday mosque ; this is a very lofty
building (‘caraz), the highest in the fort ; it is seen, with the fort,
from the Dilpiir-hill (cv. 30 m. away). People say the stone for
it was cut out and brought from the large lake above-mentioned.
Rahim-dad has made a wooden ( yighach) ¢alar in his garden, and

had been altered before Babur saw it but as it was only about 10 years old at that time,
it was in its first form, presumably. Perhaps Babur saw it in a bad light. The
dimensions Cunningham gives of it suggest that the high dome must have been
frequently ill-lighted.

' The word ¢a/ar, having various applications, is not easy to match with a single
English word, nor can one be sure in all cases what it means, a platform, a hall, or
etc. To find an equivalent for its diminutive /a/ar-ghina is still more difficult.
Rahim-dad’s /a/ar-ette will have stood on the flat centre of the dome, raised on four
pillars or perhaps with its roof only so-raised ; one is sure there would be a roof as
protection against sun or moon. It may be noted that the dome is not visible outside
from below, but is hidden by the continuation upwards of walls which form a mean-
looking parallelogram of masonry.

porches at the gates, which, after the Hindustani fashion, are
somewhat low and shapeless.

(g. The Urwah-valley.)

(Sep. 28th) Next day (Muh. 13th) at the Mid-day Prayer we
rode out to visit places in Gualiar we had not yet seen. We
saw the ‘zwzarat called Badalgar* which is part of Man-sing’s
fort (gz/a‘), went through the Hati-piil and across the fort to
a place called Urwa (Urwah), which is a valley-bottom (g#/) on its
western side. Though Urwa is outside the fort-wall running
along the top of the hill, it has two stages (#urtaba) of high
wall at its mouth. The higher of these walls is some 30 or 40
gari (yards) high ; this is the longer one ; at each end it joins
the wall of the fort. The second wall curves in and joins the
middle part of the first ; it is the lower and shorter of the two.
This curve of wall will have been made for a water-thief ;?
within it is a stepped well (zw@’zz) in which water is reached by
10 or 15 steps. Above the Gate leading from the valley to this
walled-well the name of Sl. Shihabu’d-din Ailtmish (Altamsh)
is inscribed, with the date 630 (AH.—1233 AD.). Below this
outer wall and outside the fort there is a large lake which seems
to dwindle (at times) till no lake remains ; from it water goes
to the water-thief. There are two other lakes inside Urwa the
water of which those who live in the fort prefer to all other.

Three sides of Urwa are solid rock, not the red rock of Biana
but one paler in colour. On these sides people have cut out
idol-statues, large and small, one large statue on the south side
being perhaps 20 ga@ri (yds.) high.3 These idols are shewn quite

* This is a large outwork reached from the Gate of the same name. Babur may
have gone there specially to see the Giijari Mandir said by Cunningham to have been
built by Man-sing’s Gijar wife Mriga-nayana(fawn-eyed). Cf. Cunningham p. 351 and,
for other work done by the same Queen, inthes.e. corner of the fort, p. 344; Luard
p- 226. In this place ‘‘construction” would serve to translate ‘/arat (f.340n.).

? ab-duzd, a word conveying the notion of a stealthy taking of the water. The walls
at the mouth of Urwa were built by Altamsh for the protection of its water for the fort.
The date Babur mentions (a few lines further) is presumably that of their erection.

3 Cunningham, who gives 57 ft. as the height of this statue, says Babur estimated
it at 20 gaz, or 40ft., but thisis not so. Babur’s word is not gaz a measure of 24 fingers-
breadth, but ga@77, the length from the tip of the shoulder to the fingers-ends ; it is
about 33 inches, not less, I understand. Thus stated in ga7is Babur’s estimate of the
height comes very near Cunningham’s, being a good 55 ft. to 57 ft. (I may note that
I have usually translated gari by ‘‘yard”, as the yard is its nearest English equivalent.
The Pers. trs. of the B.N. translates by gaz, possibly a larger gaz than that of 24 fingers-
breadth 2.¢. inches.)

naked without covering for the privities. Along the sides of
the two Urwa lakes 20 or 30 wells have been dug, with water
from which useful vegetables (sabzi karliklar), flowers and trees
are grown. Unwa is not a bad place ; it is shut in (T. ##); the
idols are its defect; I, for my part, ordered them destroyed."

Going out of Urwa into the fort again, we enjoyed the window ?
of the Sultani-piil which must have been closed through the pagan
time till now, went to Rahim-dad’s flower-garden at the Evening
Prayer, there dismounted and there slept.

(2. A son of Rana Sanga negociates with Babur.)

(Sep. 29th) On Tuesday the 14th of the month came people
from Rana Sanga’s second son, Bikramajit by name, who with
his mother Padmawati was in the fort of Rantanbir. Before
I rode out for Gialiar,3 others had come from his great and
trusted Hindi, Astk by name, to indicate Bikramajit’s sub-
mission and obeisance and ask a subsistence-allowance of 70 /aks
for him ; it had been settled at that time that parganas to the
amount he asked should be bestowed on him, his men were given
leave to go, with tryst for Gialiar which we were about to visit.
They came into Gialiar somewhat after the trysting-day. The
Hindi Asiik ¢ is said to be a near relation of Bikramajit’s mother
Padmawati ; he, for his part, set these particulars forth father-
like and son-like ;5 they, for theirs, concurring with him, agreed
to wish me well and serve me. At the time when SI]. Mahmid
(Khifji) was beaten by Rana Sanga and fell into pagan captivity

(925 AH.—I519 AD.) he possessed a famous crown-cap (¢@j-kula)
and golden belt, accepting which Sanga let him go free. That
crown-cap and golden belt must have become Bikramajit’s ; his
elder brother Ratan-si, now Rana of Chitir in his father’s place,
had asked for them but Bikramajit had not given them up," and
now made the men he sent to me, speak to me about them, and
ask for Biana in place of Rantanbiir. We led them away from
the Biana question and promised Shamsabad in exchange for
Rantanbir. To-day (A7uh. 14th) they were given a nine days’
tryst for Biana, were dressed in robes of honour, and allowed
to go.

(2. Hindi temples visited.)

We rode from the flower-garden to visit the idol-houses of
Gialiar. Some are two, and some are three storeys high, each
storey rather low, in the ancient fashion. On their stone plinths
(zara) are sculptured images. Some idol-houses, College-fashion,
have a portico, large high cupolas? and madrdsa-like cells, each
topped by a slender stone cupola.3_ In the lower cells are idols
carved in the rock.

After enjoying the sight of these buildings (‘zdratlar) we left
the fort by the south Gate,4 made an excursion to the south, and
went (north) to the Char-bagh Rahim-dad had made over-against
the Hati-pils He had prepared a feast of cooked-meat (asi)
for us and, after setting excellent food before us, made offering

ment that the precious things were at Bikramajit’s disposition. Perhaps they had
been in his mother’s charge during her husband’s life. They were given later to
Bahadur Shah of Gujrat.

? The Teli Mandir has not a cupola but a waggon-roof of South Indian style, whence
it may be that it has the southern name Telingana, suggested by Col. Luard.

end of the fort-hill where there is only a postern approached bya flight of stone steps
(Cunningham p. 332).

near the Hati-pill itself where the scarp is precipitous.

than that must have been ridden ;* close to the Mid-day Prayer
we reached a fall where sufficient water for one mill was coming
down a slope (gi) an arghamchi? high. Below the fall there
is a large lake ; above it the water comes flowing through solid
rock ; there is solid rock also below the fall. A lake forms
wherever the water falls. On the banks of the water lie piece
after piece of rock as if for seats, but the water is said not
always to be there. We sat down above the fall and ate ma‘juz,
went up-stream to visit its source (4adayat), returned, got out on
higher ground, and stayed while musicians played and reciters
repeated things (ima aitilar). The Ebony-tree which Hindis
call é2zd%, was pointed out to those who had not seen it before.
We went down the hill and, between the Evening and Bed-time
Prayers, rode away, slept at a place reached near the second
watch (midnight), and with the on-coming of the first watch of
day (6a.m. Muh. 16th—-Oct. rst) reached the Char-bagh and dis-
mounted.

mounted there in the first watch.5

visited a Hot-bath which Abi’l-fath had made, rode on, and
dismounted at the dam-head where the new Char-bagh is in
making.

(Oct. 5th) Having stayed the night there, at dawn (Monday
20th) I visited what places had been ordered made.* The face
(yaz) of the roofed-tank, ordered cut in the solid rock, was not
being got up quite straight ; more stone-cutters were sent for
who were to make the tank-bottom level, pour in water, and, by
help of the water, to get the sides to one height. They got the
face up straight just before the Other Prayer, were then ordered
to fill the tank with water, by help of the water made the sides
match, then busied themselves to smooth them. I ordered
a water-chamber (a@6-4hdna) made at a place where it would be
cut in the solid rock ; inside it was to be a small tank also cut
in the solid rock.

(Here the record of 6 days ts wanting.) ?

(Oct. r2th?) To-day, Monday (277% ?),there was a main party.

On the night of Wednesday,3 after opening the mouth and eating

seems to be between the unfinished account of doings in Dhilpir and the incomplete
one of those of the Monday of the party. For one of the intermediate days Babur
had made an appointment, when in Giaaliar (f. 343), with the envoys of Bikramajit, the
trysting-day being Muh. 23rd (¢.e. 9 days after Muh. 14th). Babur is likely to have
gone to Bidna as planned ; that envoys met him there may be surmised from the
circumstance that when negociations with Bikramajit were renewed in Agra (f.345),
two sets of envoys were present, a ‘‘ former” one anda ‘‘ later ” one, and this although
all envoys had been dismissed from Gialiar. The ‘‘former” ones will have been
those who went to Biana, were not given leave there, but were brought on to Agra ;
the ‘‘later” ones may have come to Agra direct from Ranthambhor. It suits all
round to take it that pages have been lost on which was the record of the end of the
Dhilpir visit, of the journey to the, as yet unseen, fort of Biana, of tryst kept by the
envoys, of other doings in Biana where, judging from the time taken to reach Sikri,

buildings were not getting on to my satisfaction ; the overseers
therefore were threatened and punished. We rode on from
Sikri between the Other and Evening Prayers, passed through
Marhakir, dismounted somewhere and slept.

(Oct. 15th) Riding on (Thursday 30th), we got into Agra
during the first watch (6-9 a.m.). In the fort I saw the honoured
Khadija-sultan Begim who had stayed behind for several reasons
when Fakhr-i-jahan Begim started for Kabul. Crossing Jin

in the Quran (Hughes’ Dictionary of Islam s.n. Paradise). Babur appears to have
reached Agra on the Ist of Safar; the 2nd may well have been spent on the home

(0. A levy on stipendiaries.)

(Oct. 22nd) By this time the treasure of Iskandar and Ibrahim
in Dihli and Agra was at an end. Royal orders were given
therefore, on Thursday the 8th of Safar, that each stipendiary
(wajhdar) should drop into the Diwan, 30 in every 100 of his
allowance, to be used for war-material and appliances, for equip-
ment, for powder, and for the pay of gunners and matchlockmen.

(p. Royal letters sent into Khurasan.)

(Oct. 24th) On Saturday the roth of the month, Pay-master
Sl. Muhammad’s foot-man Shah Qasim who once before had
taken letters of encouragement to kinsfolk in Khurasan,? was
sent to Heri with other letters to the purport that, through God’s
grace, our hearts were at ease in Hindistan about the rebels and
pagans of east and west; and that, God bringing it aright, we
should use every means and assuredly in the coming spring
should touch the goal of our desire.3 On the margin of a royal
letter sent to Ahmad Afshar (Turk) a summons to Faridin the
gabiz-player was written with my own hand.

(Here the record of 11 days ts wanting.)

t This promise was first proffered in Gialiar (f. 343).

2 These may be Bai-qara kinsfolk or Miran-shahis married to them. No record of
Shah Qasim’s earlier mission is preserved ; presumably he was sent in 934 AH. and the
record will have been lost with much more of that year’s. Khwand-amir may well
have had to do with this second mission, since he could inform Babur of the discomfort
caused in Heri by the near leaguer of ‘Ubaidu’l-lah Adzbeg.

touch in the coming spring. What seems likely to be implied is what Erskine says
and more, vzz. return to Kabul, renewal of conflict with the Aizbeg and release of
Khurasan kin through success. As is said by Babur immediately after this, Tahmasp
of Persia had defeated ‘Ubaidu’l-lah Adzdeg before Babur’s letter was written.

(q. News from Kabul and Khurasan.)? a
(Nov. 4th) On Wednesday the 21st of the month (Safar)
a Hindistani foot-man (piada) brought dutiful letters (arz- ‘

dashtlar) from Kamran and Khwaja Dost-i-khawand. The ,
Khwaja had reached Kabul on the toth of Zil-hijja3 and will
have been anxious to go on4 to Humayiin’s presence, but there ;
comes to him a man from Kamran, saying, “ Let the honoured ;
Khwaja come (to see me) ; let him deliver whatever royal orders
there may be; let him go on to Humayiin when matters have
been talked over.” 5 Kamran will have gone into Kabul on the
17th of Zu’l-hijja (Sep. 2xd), will have talked with the Khwaja
and, on the 28th of the same month, will have let him go on for
Fort Victory (Q7la‘-z-gafar).
There was this excellent news in the dutiful letters received :—

that Shah-zada Tahmasp, resolute to put down the Aizheg,° had
overcome and killed Rinish (var. Zinish) Adzbeg in Damghan
and made a general massacre of his people ; that “‘Ubaid Khan,
getting sure news about the Qizi/-bash (Red-head) had risen from
round Heri, gone to Merv, called up to him there all the sultans
of Samarkand and those parts, and that all the sultans of
Ma wara’u’n-nahr had gone to help him.7

Fol. 346. This same foot-man brought the further news that Humayiin
was said to have had a son by the daughter of Yadgar Taghai,

* Simab yimakni bunyad gildim, a statement which would be less abrupt if it followed
a record of illness. Such a record may have been made and lost.

° The preliminaries to this now somewhat obscure section will have been lost in the
gap of 934AH. They will have given Babur’s instructions to Khwaja Dost-i-khawand
and have thrown light on the unsatisfactory state of Kabul, concerning which a good
deal comes out later, particularly in Babur’s letter to its Governor Khwaja Kalan. It
may be right tosuppose that Kamran wanted Kabul and that he expected the Khwaja
to bring him an answer to his request for it, whether made by himself or for him,
through some-one, his mother perhaps, whom Babur now sent for to Hindiistan.

3 934 AH.—August 26th 1528p.

* The useful verb éiéramak which connotes agitation of mind with physical move-
ment, will here indicate anxiety on the Khwaja’s part to fulfil his mission to Humayan.
— Kamran’s messenger seems to repeat his master’s words, using the courteous
imperative of the 3rd person plural.

* Though Babur not infrequently writes of e.g. Bengalis and Aazbegs and Turks in
the singular, the Bengali, the Aiizbeg, the Turk, he seems here to mean ‘Ubaidu’l-lah,
the then dominant Aiizbeg, although Kichiim was Khaqan.

’ This muster preceded defeat near Jam of which Babur heard some 19 days later.

and that Kamran was said to be marrying in Kabul, taking the
daughter of his mother’s brother Sl]. ‘Ali Mirza (Begchik).*

(vr. Honours for an artificer.)?

On this same day Sayyid Dakni of Shiraz the diviner (ghazba-
gar ?) was made to wear a dress of honour, given presents, and
ordered to finish the arched (?) well (AAzdaralig-chah) as he best
knew how.

(s. The Walidiyyah-risala (Parental-tract).)

(Wov. 6th) On Friday the 23rd of the month3 such heat 4
appeared in my body that with difficulty I got through the
Congregational Prayer in the Mosque, and with much trouble
through the Mid-day Prayer, in the book-room, after due time,
and little by little. Thereafter5 having had fever, I trembled
less on Sunday (ov. 28th). During the night of Tuesday © the
27th of the month Safar, it occurred to me to versify (zagm gilmaq)

* Humiyiin’s wife was Bega Begim, the later Haji Begim; Kamran’s bride was
her cousin perhaps named Mah-afriz (Gul-badan’s Humaytin-nama f.646). The
hear-say tense used by the messenger allows the inference that he was not accredited to
give the news but merely repeated the rumour of Kabul. The accredited bearer-of-
good-tidings came later (f. 3464).

2 There are three enigmatic words in this section. The first is the Sayyid’s
cognomen ; was he dakui, rather dark of hue, or zaézz, one who knows, or rukni,
one who props, erects scaffolding, efc. ? The second mentions his occupation ; was
he a ghatba-gar, diviner (Erskine, water-finder), a jzba-gar, cuirass-maker, or a 72ba-
gar, cistern-maker, which last suits with well-making? The third describes the kind
of well he had in hand, perhaps the stone one of f. 3534; had it scaffolding, or was it
for drinking-water only (kAwara/ig) ; had it an arch, or was it chambered (Awazalig)?
If Babur’s orders for the work had been preserved,—they may be lost from f. 3444,
trouble would have been saved to scribes and translators, as an example of whose
uncertainty it may be mentioned that from the third word (Z4waralig?) Erskine
extracted ‘‘ jets d’eau and artificial water-works”, and de Courteille ‘‘ ¢az//é dans le
roc vif”.

3 All Babur’s datings in Safar are inconsistent ah his of Muharram, if a Muharram
of 30 days [as given by Gladwin and others].

4 hararat. This Erskine renders by ‘‘so violent an illness ” (p. 388), de Courteille
by “Sune inflammation d’entrailles” (ii,357), both swayed perhaps by the earlier
mention, on Muh. oth, of Babur’s medicinal quick-silver, a drug long in use in
India for internal affections (Erskine). Some such ailment may have been recorded
and the record lost (f. 3454 and n. 8), but the heat, fever, and trembling in the illness
of Safar 23rd, taken with the reference to last’s year’s attack of fever, all point to
climatic fever.

5 aindini (or, Gndini). Consistently with the readings quoted in the preceding
note, E. and de C. date the onset of the fever as Sunday and translate aindini to
mean “‘twodaysafter”. It cannot be necessary however to specify the interval between
Friday and Sunday; the text is not explicit ; it seems safe to surmise only that the
cold fit was less severe on Sunday ; the fever had ceased on the following Thursday.

I laid it to heart that if I, going to the soul of his Reverence ? for
protection, were freed from this disease, it would be a sign that
my poem was accepted, just as the author of the Qastdatu’l-
burda 3 was freed from the affliction of paralysis when his poem
had been accepted. To this end I began to versify the tract,
using the metre4+ of Maulana ‘Abdu’r-rahim Jam's Subhatu'l-
abrar (Rosary of the Righteous). Thirteen couplets were made
in that same night. I tasked myself not to make fewer than Io
a day ; in the end one day had been omitted. While last year
every time such illness had happened, it had persisted at least
a month or 40 days,5 this year, by God’s grace and his Reverence’s
favour, I was free, except for a little depression (afsurda), on
Thursday the 29th of the month (Wov. rath). The end of
versifying the contents of the tract was reached on Saturday
the 8th of the first Rabi‘ (Vov. 20th). One day 52 couplets had
been made.®

Jan. 1916, H. Beveridge’s art. The tract, so far as we have searched, is now known
in European literature only through Babur’s metrical translation of it ; and this, again,
is known only through the Rampur Diwan. [It may be noted here, though the topic
belongs to the beginning of the Babur-ndma (f. 2), that the Raskakat contains particulars
about Ahrari’s interventions for peace between Babur’s father ‘Umar Shaikh and those
with whom he quarrelled. ]

that is to say, the Elphinstone Codex belonging to the Faculty of Advocates of
Edinburgh.

notice in M. René Basset’s article of the Encyclopedia of [slam (Leyden and London).

to omit the # (and), thus allowing the reference to be to last year’s illnesses only;
because no record, of any date, survives of illness lasting even one full month, and
no other year has a /acwna of sufficient length unless one goes improbably far back : for
these attacks seem to be of Indian climatic fever. One in last year (934 AH.) lasting
25-26 days (f. 331) might be called a month’s illness ; another or others may have
happened in the second half of the year and their record be lost, as several have been
lost, to the detriment of connected narrative.

© Mr. Erskine’s rendering (Afemozrs p. 388) of the above section shows something
of what is gained by acquaintance which he had not, with the Raskahat-i- ‘ainw l-hayat
and with Babur’s versified Wakdiyyah-risala.

(u. Messengers from Humayin.)

(Nov. 21st) On Sunday the 9th of the first Rabi’, Beg
Muhammad {a‘allugchi? came, who had been sent last year
(934AH.) at the end of Muharram to take a dress of honour and
a horse to Humayin.3

(Nov. 22nd) On Monday the roth of the month there came
from Humayin’s presence Wais Laghari’s (son) Beg-gina (Little
Beg) and Bian Shaikh, one of Humayiin’s servants who had come
as the messenger of the good tidings of the birth of Humayiin’s
son whose name he gave as Al-aman. Shaikh Abi’l-wajd found
Shah sa‘adatmand + to be the date of his birth.

(v. Rapid travel.)

Bian Shaikh set out long after Beg-gina. He parted from
Humayin on Friday the 9th of Safar (Oct. 23rd) at a place
below Kishm called Di-shamba (Monday); he came into Agra
on Monday the !oth of the first Rabi‘ (Vov. 23rd). He came
very quickly! Another time he actually came from Qila‘-i-zafar
to Qandahar in 11 days.5

* This gap, like some others in the diary of 935 AH. can be attributed safely to
loss of pages, because preliminaries are now wanting to several matters which Babur
records shortly after it. Such are (1) the specification of the three articles sent to
Nasrat Shah, (2) the motive for the feast of f. 3514, (3) the announcement of the approach
of the surprising group of envoys, who appear without introduction at that entertain-
ment, in a manner opposed to Babur’s custom of writing, (4) an account of their arrival
and reception.

the death of the Shah of Badakhshan (f. 2136).

(w. News of Tahmasp’s victory over the Aizbegs.)

Bian Shaikh brought news about Shah-zada Tahméasp’s
advancing out of ‘Iraq and defeating the Aiizbeg.t Here are
his particulars: —Shah-zada Tahmasp, having come out of ‘Iraq
with 40,000 men arrayed in Rimi fashion of matchlock and cart,?
advances with great speed, takes Bastam, slaughters Rinish (var.
Zinish) Aazsbeg and his men in Damghan, and’from there passes
right swiftly on. Kipik Bis son Qambar-i-‘ali Beg is beaten
by one of the Qizil-bash (Red-head)’s men, and with his few
followers goes to ‘Ubaid Khan’s presence. ‘Ubaid Khan finds
it undesirable to stay near Heri, hurriedly sends off gallopers
to all the sultans of Balkh, Hisar, Samarkand, and Tashkend
(Tashkint) and goes himself to Merv. Siiinjak Sl.’s younger son
Baraq Sl. from Tashkend, Kiichtm Khan, with (his sons) Aba
-sa‘id Sl. and Pilad Sl. and Jani Beg SI. with his sons, from
Samarkand and Mian-kal, Mahdi Sl.’s and Hamza Sl.’s sons
from Hisar, Kitin-qara Sl]. from Balkh, all these sultans assemble
right swiftly in Merv. To them their informers (¢é/-chi) take
news that Shah-zada, after saying, “‘Ubaid Khan is seated near
Heri with few men only,” had been advancing swiftly with his
40,000 men, but that when he heard of this assembly (ze. in
Merv), he made a ditch in the meadow of Radagan‘4 and seated

7 On Muh. toth 934AaH.—Sep. 26th 1528ap. For accounts of the campaign see
Rieu’s Suppl. Persian Cat. under Historées of Tahmasp (Churchill Collection) ; the
Habibu's-siyar and the ‘Alam-drai-‘abbasi, the last a highly rhetorical work. Babur’s
accounts (Index s.7, Jam) are merely repetitions of news given to him; he is not
responsible for mistakes he records, such as those of f.354. [It must be mentioned
that Mr. Erskine has gone wrong in his description of the, battle, the starting-point
of error being his reversal of two events, the encampment of Tahmasp at Radagan and
his passage through Mashhad. A century ago less help, through maps and travel,
was available than now. ]

* tufak u ardba, the method of array Babur adopted from the Rimi-Persian model.

3 Tahmasp’s main objective, aimed at earlier than the Aizbeg muster in Merv,
was Herat, near which ‘Ubaid Khan had been for 7 months. He did not take the
shortest route for Mashhad, véz. the Damghan-Sabzawar-Nishapir road, but went
from Damghin for Mashhad by way of Kalpiish (‘A/am-drai lith.ed. p.45) and
Radagan. Two military advantages are obvious on this route; (1) it approaches
Mashhad by the descending road of the Kechef-valley, thus avoiding the climb into
that valley by a pass beyond Nishapiir on the alternative route; and (2) it passes
through the fertile lands of Radagin. [For Kalpiish and the route see Fr. military map,

it may be useful to note here that the town seems to borrow its name from the ancient
tower standing near it, the Afi/-i-radagan, or, as Réclus gives it, Zour de méimandan,
both names meaning, Tower of the bounteous (or, beneficent, highly-distinguished,

himself there? Here-upon the Atizbegs, with entire disregard
of their opponents,? left their counsels at this :—“ Let all of us
sultans and khans seat ourselves in Mashhad ;3 let a few of us
be told off with 20,000 men to go close to the Qizil-bash camp 4
and not let them put head out; let us order magicians 5 to work
their magic directly Scorpio appears ;° by this stratagem the
enemy will be enfeebled, and we shall overcome.” So said, they
march from Merv. Shah-zada gets out of Mashhad.? He
confronts them near Jam-and-Khirgird.® There defeat befalls the
Aizbeg side9 A mass of sultans are overcome and slaughtered.

that any sultan except Kichiim Khan has escaped ; not a man
who went with the army has come back up to now.” The

Merv Oasis.) Perhaps light on the distinguished people (r@dagam) is given by the
Dabistan’s notice ofan ancient sect, the Radiyan, seeming to be fire-worshippers whose
chief was Rad-giina, an eminently brave hero of the latter part of Jamshid’s reign
(8008.c. ?). Of the town Radagan Daulat Shah makes frequent mention. A second
town so-called and having a tower lies north of Ispahan.

t In these days of trench-warfare it would give a wrong impression to say that
Tahmasp entrenched himself; he did what Babur did before his battles at Panipat
and Kanwa (g.z. ).

? The Aiizbegs will have omitted from their purview of affairs that Tahmasp’s men
were veterans. r

3 The holy city had been captured by ‘Ubaid Khan in 933 AH. (1525 AD.), but nothing
in Bian Shaikh’s narrative indicates that they were now there in force.

6 If then, as now, Scorpio’s appearance were expected in Oct.-Nov., the Aiizbegs
had greatly over-estimated their power to check Tahmasp’s movements ; but it seems
fairly clear that they expected Scorpio to follow Virgo in Sept.-Oct. according to the
ancient view of the Zodiacal Signs which allotted two houses to the large Scorpio and,
if it admitted Libra at all, placed it between Scorpio’s claws (Virgil’s Georgécs i, 32
and Ovid’s Afetamorphoses, ii, 195.—H.B.).

7 It would appear that the Aiizbegs, after hearing that Tahmasp was encamped at
Radagan, expected to interpose themselves in his way at Mashhad and to get their
20,000 to Radagan before he broke camp. Tahmasp’s swiftness spoiled their plan ;
he will have stayed at Radagan a short time only, perhaps till he had further news of
the Aiizbegs, perhaps also for commissariat purposes and to rest his force. He visited
the shrine of Imam Reza, and had reached Jam in time to confront his adversaries as
they came down to it from Zawarabad (Pilgrims’-town).

® or, Khirjard, as many MSS. have it. Itseems to be a hamlet or suburb of Jam.
The ‘Alam-ardai (lith. ed. p. 40) writes Khusrau-jard-i-Jam (the Khusrau-throne of
Jam), perhaps rhetorically. The hamlet is Maulana ‘Abdu’r-rahman /ami’s birthplace
(Daulat Shah’s 7azkira?, E. G. Browne’s ed. p. 483). Jam now appears on maps as
Turbat-i-Shaikh Jami, the tomb (¢zrdat) being that of the saintly ancestor of Akbar’s
mother Hamida-bani.

9 The ‘A/am-arai (lith. ed. p. 31) says, but in grandiose language, that ‘Ubaid Khan
placed at the foot of his standard 40 of the most eminent men of Transoxania who
prayed for his success, but that as his cause was not good, their supplications were
turned backwards, and that all were slain where they had prayed.

(x. Letters written by Babur.)

(Nov. 27th and 28th) This same Bian Shaikh was sent quite
quickly back with letters for Humayiin and Kamran. These
and other writings being ready by Friday the 14th of the month
(Nov. 27th) were entrusted to him, his leave was given, and on
Saturday the 15th he got well out of Agra.

Cory oF A LETTER TO HUMAYUN.?

“The first matter, after saying, ‘Salutation’ to Humayin
whom I am longing to see, is this :—

Exact particulars of the state of affairs on that side and on
this 3 have been made known by the letters and dutiful representa-
tions brought on Monday the 1oth of the first Rabi‘ by Beg-gina
and Bian Shaikh.

A son to thee, to me a heart-enslaver (d¢/-bandi).

* Here the Ist Pers. trs. (1.0. 215 f. 214) mentions that it was Chalma who wrote and
despatched the exact particulars of the defeat of the Aizbegs. This information explains
the presumption Babur expresses. It shows that Chalma was in Hisar where he may
have written his letter to give news to Humayin. At the time Bian Shaikh left,
the Mirza was near Kishm; if he had been the enterprising man he was not, one
would surmise that he had moved to seize the chance of the sultans’ abandonment of
Hisar, without waiting for his father’s urgency (f. 3484). Whether he had done so
and was the cause of the sultans’ flight, is not known from any chronicle yet come to
our hands. Chalma’s father Ibrahim Jani died fighting for Babur against Shaibaq
Khan in 906AnH. (f. 904).

As the sense of the name-of-office Chalma is still in doubt, I suggest that it may be
an equivalent of affabachi, bearer of the water-bottle on journeys. 7: chalma can
mean a water-vessel carried on the saddle-bow; one Chalma on record was a safarchi;
if, in this word, safar be read to mean journey, an approach is made to aftabachi
(fol. 156 and note ; Blochmann’s A.-i-A. p. 378 and n.3).

* The copies of Babur’s Turki letter to Humayin and the later one to Khwaja Kalan
(f. 359) are in some MSS. of the Persian text translated only (1.0. 215 f. 214) ; in
others appear in Turki only (I.O. 217 f. 240) ; in others appear in Turki and Persian
(B.M. Add. 26,000 and I.O. 2989) ; while in Muh. Shirazi’s lith. ed. they are omitted
altogether (p. 228).

the false rumour that the Balkhis had invited and were fetching

Shirin’s address to Khusrau when she refuses to marry him because at the time he is
fighting for his sovereign position ; and they say, in effect, that while all other work
stops for marriage (Lad#hudai), kingly rule does not.

to the ages of the brothers, but aa/agh/ar expresses greatness of position as well as
seniority in age, and the dictum may be taken asa Turki version of ‘‘ Noblesse oblige”,
and may also mean ‘‘ The great must be magnanimous”. (Cf. de C.’s Dict. s.7.

off, on Saturday the 22nd of the month, to the amirs of the East
headed by Sl. Junaid Barvlas. His word-of-mouth message was,
that ‘Askari was being sent on before the fighting apparatus,
culverin, cart and matchlock, was ready ; that it was the royal
order for the sultans and amirs of the far side of Gang to muster
in ‘Askari’s presence, and, after consultation with well-wishers
on that side, to move in whatever direction, God willing ! might
favour fortune ; that if there should be work needing me, please
God! I would get to horse as soon as the person gone with the

should be made as to whether the Bengali (Nasrat Shah) were
friendly and single-minded ; that, if nothing needed my presence
in those parts, I should not make stay, but should move else-
where at once ;? and that after consulting with well-wishers, they
were to take ‘Askari with them, and, God willing! settle matters

(aa. Babur visits one of his officers.)

(Dec. 13th) On Sunday the last day of the month (Rade. 30th)
I went to Sl. Muhammad Bakhshi’s house. After spreading
a carpet, he brought gifts. His offering in money and goods
was more than 2/aks.2_ When food and offering had been set
out, we went into another room where sitting, we ate main.
We came away at the 3rd watch (midnight ?), crossed the water,
and went to the private house.

(6. The Agra-Kabul road measured.)

(Dec. 17th) On Thursday the 4th of the latter Rabi‘, it was
settled that Chiqmaq Beg with Shahi faweghachi?’s3 clerkship,
should measure the road between Agra and Kabul. At every
9th kuroh (cir.18m.), a tower was to be erected 12géris high 4 and
having a char-dara 5 on the top; at every 18th kuroh (ezr. 36m.),°
6 post-horses were to be kept fastened ; and arrangement was to
be made for the payment of post-masters and grooms, and for
horse-corn. The order was, “If the place where the horses are
fastened up,” be near a crown-domain, let those there provide for
the matters mentioned ; if not, let the cost be charged on the beg

t These statements of date are consistent with Babur’s earlier explicit entries and
with Erskine’s equivalents of the Christian Era, but at variance with Gladwin’s and
with Wiistenfeldt’s calculation that Rabi‘II. 1st was Dec. 13th. Yet Gladwin (Revenue
Accounts, ed. 1790AD. p. 22) gives Rabi‘ I. 30days. Without in the smallest degree
questioning the two European calculations, I follow Babur, because in his day there
may have been allowed variation which finds no entry in methodical calendars.
Erskine followed Babur’s statements ; he is likely nevertheless to have seen Gladwin’s
book. 7

is uncertain. Babur’s towers were not ‘‘ os minars”, nor is it said that he ordered
each Azroh to be marked on the road. Some of the dos mindrs on the ‘‘ old Mughal

® Neither Erskine (AZems. p. 394), nor de Courteille (A/éms. ii, 370) recognized the
word Afubin here, although each mentions the poem later (p. 431 and ii, 461), deriving
his information about it from the 42bar-nadma, Erskine direct, de Courteille by way
of the Turki translation of the same Akbar-nama passage, which Ilminsky found in
Kehr’s volume and which is one of the much discussed “* Fragments”, at first taken
to be extra writings of Babur’s (cf. Index 7% /oco s.n. Fragments). Ilminsky (p. 455)
prints the word clearly, as one who knows it ; he may have seen that part of the poem
itself which is included in Berésine’s Chrestomathie Turgue (p. 226 to p. 272), under the
title Fragment d’un podme inconnu de Babour, and have observed that Babur himself
shews his title to be A/1diz, in the lines of his colophon (p. 271),

Cha bidn gildim anda shar‘iyat,

Ni ‘ajab gar Mubin didine at ?
(Since in it I have made exposition of Laws, what wonder if I named it AZudin
(exposition) ?) Cf. Zranslator’s Note, p.437. [Berésine says (Ch.T.) that he prints
half of his ‘‘ zs2gue manuscrit” of the poem. ]

* The passage Babur quotes comes from the A/udin section on tayammum mas@la
(purification with sand), where he tells his son sand may be used, Sa yurag bilsa sindin
air bir mil (if from thee water be one mi/ distant), and then interjects the above
explanation of what the mi/is. Two lines of his original are not- with the Babur-
nama.

3 The fandé was thus 120ft. long. Cf. A.-i-A. Jarrett i, 414 ; Wilson’s Glossary of
Indian Terms and Gladwin’s Revenue Accounts, p.14.

* Babur’s customary method of writing allows the inference that he recorded, in
due place, the coming and reception of the somewhat surprising group of guests now
mentioned as at this entertainment. That preliminary record will have been lost in one
or more of the small gaps in his diary of 935AH. The envoys from the Samarkand
Aizbegs and from the Persian Court may have come in acknowledgment of the Fath-
nama which announced victory over Rana Sanga ; the guests from Farghana will have
accepted the invitation sent, says Gul-badan, ‘‘in all directions,” after Babur’s defeat
of Sl. Ibrahim Ladi, to urge hereditary servants and Timirid and Chingiz-khanid
kinsfolk to come and see prosperity with him now when “‘the Most High has bestowed
sovereignty ~~ 2934; Gul-badan’s H.N. f. 11).

be those to. whom went a copy of the A/udin under cover of a letter addressed to
lawyers of Ma wara’u’n-nahr (f.351n.1). The Khwajas were in Agra three weeks
after Baibur finished his metrical version of their ancestor’s Waldiyyah-risala ;
whether their coming (which must have been announced some time before their
arrival), had part in directing his attention to the tract can only be surmised (f. 346).

4 He was an Aiizbeg (f.371) and from his association here with a Bai-qara, and,
later with Qasim-i-husain who was half Bai-qara, half Aiizbeg, seems likely to be of
the latter’s family (Index s.7272.).

5 sachag kitirdi (kilturdi?) No record survives to tell the motive for this feast ;
perhaps the gifts made to Babur were congratulatory on the birth of a grandson, the
marriage of a son, and on the generally-prosperous state of his affairs.

his sons, Abii-sa‘id, mentioned below, had sent envoys. With Abii-sa‘id is named
Mihr-ban who was one of Kiichiim’s wives; Puldd was their son. Mihr-ban was,
I think, a half-sister of Babur, a daughter of ‘Umar Shaikh and Umid of Andijan
(f.9), and a full-sister of Nasir. No doubt she had been captured on one of the
occasions when Babur lost to the Aizbegs. In 925AH.-1519AD. (f. 2376) when he
sent his earlier Diwan to Pulad Sl. (7ranslator’s Note, p. 438) he wrote a verse on its
back which looks to be addressed to his half-sister through her son.

the water. Gifts were made to the stone-cutters, and labourers,
and the whole body of workmen in the way customary for
master-workmen and wage-earners of Agra.

(f A Persian account of the battle of Jam.)

(Dec. 28th) On Tuesday the 16th of the month (Redz‘ JL.)
came one of Div Sl.’s? servants, a man who had been in the fight
between the Qizil-bash and Atizbeg, and who thus described
it :—The battle between the Atizbegs and Turkmans 3 took place
on ‘Ashiir-day (Muh. roth) near Jam-and-Khirgird4 They
fought from the first dawn till the Mid-day Prayer. The
Aiizbegs were 300,000; the Turkmans may have been (as is
said?) 40 to 50,000; he said that he himself estimated their
dark mass at 100,000; on the other hand, the Aizbegs said
they themselves were 100,000, The Qjizil-bash leader (a@damz)
fought after arraying cart, culverin and matchlockmen in the
Rimi fashion, and after protecting himself.s Shah-zada® and
Juha SI. stood behind the carts with 20,000 good braves. The
rest of the begs were posted right and left beyond the carts.
These the Aiizbeg beat at once on coming up, dismounted and

® One occupation of these now blank days is indicated by the date of the ‘‘ Rampur
Diwin”, Thursday Rabi‘ II. 15th (Dec. 27th).

2 The demon (or, athlete) sultan of Rumelia (Rémi) ; once Tahmasp’s guardian
( Zazkirat-t-Tahmasp, Bib. Ind. ed. Phillott, p.2). Some writers say he was put to
death by Tahmasp (7. 12) in 933AH. ; if this were so, it is strange to find a servant
described as his in 935AH. (An account of the battle is given in the Sharaf-nama,
written in 1005 AH. by Sharaf Khan who was reared in Tahmasp’s house. The book
has been edited by Veliaminof-Zernof and translated into French by Charmoy ; cf.
Trs. vol. ii, part i, p.555.—. Beveridge.)

3 This name, used by one who was with the Shah’s troops, attracts attention ; it
may show the composition of the Persian army; it may differentiate between the
troops and their ‘‘ Qizil-bash leader”.

4 Several writers give Sari-qamsh (Charmoy, voseau jaune) as the name of the
village where the battle was fought; Sharaf Khan gives ‘Umarabad and mentions
that after the fight Tahmasp spent some time in the meadow of Sari-qamsh.

5 The number of Tahmasp’s guns being a matter of interest, reference should be
made to Babur’s accounts of his own battles in which he arrayed in Rimi (Ottoman)
fashion ; it will then be seen that the number of carts does not imply the number of
guns (Index s.2. ardba, cart).

® This cannot but represent Tahmasp who was on the battle-field (see his own story
infra). He was 14 years old; perhaps he was called Shah-zada, and not Shah, on
account of his youth, or because under guardianship (?). Readers of the Persian
histories of his reign may know the reason. Babur hitherto has always called the boy
Shah-zada ; after the victory at Jam, he styleshim Shah. Jiha Sl. (Za4/#) who was
with him on the field, was Governor of Ispahan.

overcame many, making all scurry off. He then wheeled to the
(Qizil-bash) rear and took loot in camel and baggage. At length
those behind the carts loosed the chains and came out. Here
also the fight was hard. Thrice they flung the Aiizbeg back ;
by God’s grace they beat him. Nine sultans, with Kichtim
Khan, ‘Ubaid Khan and Abi-sa‘fid Sl. at their head, were
captured ; one, Abii-sa‘id SI. is said to be alive; the rest have
gone to death.t ‘Ubaid Khan’s body was found, but not his
head. Of Atizbegs 50,000, and of Turkmans 20,000 were slain.?

(Here matter seems to have been lost.) 3

(gg. Plan of campaign.)

(Dec. 30th) On this same day (Thursday Radz‘ JT, 78th) came
Ghiagu’d-din the armourer + who had gone to Jiina-pir (Jinpiir)
with tryst of 16 days,5 but, as Sl. Junaid and the rest had led

' If this Persian account of the battle be in its right place in Babur’s diary, it is
singular that the narrator should be so ill-informed at a date allowing facts to be
known ; the three sultans he names as killed escaped to die, Kichiim in 937AH.—
1530AD., Abi-sa‘id in 940 AH.—1533AD., ‘Ubaid in 946AH.—1539AD. (Lane-
Poole’s A/uhammadan Dynasties). It would be natural for Babur to comment on the
mistake, since envoys from two of the sultans reported killed, were in Agra. There
had been time for the factsto be known: the battle was fought on Sep. 26th ; the
news of it was in Agra on Nov. 23rd ; envoys from both adversaries were at Babur’s
entertainment on Dec. 19th. From this absence of comment and for the reasons
indicated in note 3 (fra), it appears that matter has been lost from the text.

? Tahmasp’s account of the battle is as follows ( 7.-2-Z. p. 11) :—“‘ I marched against
the Aiizbegs. The battle took place outside Jam. At the first onset, Aazbeg
prevailed over Qizil-bash. Ya‘qitb SI. fled and Sl. Walima 7a#/a and other officers
of the right wing were defeated and put to flight. Putting my trust in God, I prayed
and advanced some paces. . . . One of my body-guard getting up with ‘Ubaid struck
him with a sword, passed on, and occupied himself with another. Qialij Bahadur and
other Aiizbegs carried off the wounded ‘Ubaid ; Kiachkinji (Kicham) Khan and
Jani Khan Beg, when they became aware of this state of affairs, fled to Merv. Men
who had fled from our army rejoined us that day. That night I spent on the barren
plain (safra’). I did not know what had happened to ‘Ubaid. I thought perhaps
they were devising some stratagem against me.” The ‘A.-‘A. says that ‘Ubaid’s
assailant, on seeing his low stature and contemptible appearance, left him for a more
worthy foe.

3 Not only does some comment from Babur seem needed onan account of deaths he
knew had not occurred, but loss of matter may be traced by working backward from
his next explicit date (/7iday 19¢h), to do which shows fairly well that the ‘‘same
day” will be not Tuesday the 16th but Thursday the 18th. Ghidgu’d-din’s reception
was on the day preceding Friday 19th, so that part of Thursday’s record (as shewn
by on this same day”), the whole of Wednesday’s, and (to suit an expected comment
by Babur on the discrepant story of the Aizbeg deaths) part of Tuesday’s are missing.
The gap may well have contained mention of IIasan Chalabi’s coming (f. 357), or
explain why he had not been at the feast with his younger brother.

out their army for Kharid,' he (Ghiasu’d-din) was not able to be
back at the time fixed.? Sl. Junaid said, by word-of-mouth,
“Thank God! through His grace, no work worth the Padshah’s
attention has shewn itself in these parts; if the honoured Mirza
(‘Askari) come, and if the sultans, khans and amirs here-abouts
be ordered to move in his steps, there is hope that everything in
these parts will be arranged with ease.” Though such was Sl.
Junaid’s answer, yet, as people were saying that Mulla Muhammad
Mazhab, who had been sent as envoy to Bengal after the Holy-
battle with Sanga the Pagan,3 would arrive today or tomorrow,
his news also was awaited.

(Dec. 31st) On Friday the 19th of the month I had eaten
mazun and was sitting with a special few in the private house,
when Mulla Mazhab who had arrived late, that is to say, in the
night of Saturday, came and waited on me. By asking one
particular after another, we got to know that the attitude of the
Bengali 5 was understood to be loyal and single-minded.

(Jan. 2nd) On Sunday (Radi‘ /T. 21st), 1 summoned the Turk
and Hind amirs to the private house, when counsel was taken
and the following matters were brought forward:—As the
Bengali (Nasrat Shah) has sent us an envoy °® and is said to be
loyal and single-minded, to go to Bengal itself would be
improper ; if the move be not on Bengal, no other place on that
side has treasure helpful for the army ; several places to the west
are both rich and near,

(Turki) Abounding wealth, a pagan people, a short road ;
Far though the Fast lie, this is near.

At length the matter found settlement at this :—As our westward
road is short, it will be all one if we delay a few days, so that
our minds may be at ease about the East. Again Ghiasu’d-din
the armourer was made to gallop off, with tryst of 20 days,” to

convey written orders to the eastern amirs for all the sultans,
khans, and amirs who had assembled in ‘Askari’s presence, to
move against those rebels.t The orders delivered, he was to
return by the trysted day with what ever news there might be.

(hh. Balichi incursions.)

In these days Muhammadi Kikildash made dutiful representa-
tion that again Baliichis had come and overrun several places.
Chin-timir Sl. was appointed for the business ; he was to gather
to his presence the amirs from beyond Sihrind and Samana
and with them, equipped for 6 months, to proceed against the
Balichis; namely, such amirs as ‘Adil Sultan, Sl. Muh. Daldai,
Khusrau Kikildash, Muhammad ‘Ali /ang-jang, ‘Abdu'l-‘aziz
the Master-of-the-horse, Sayyid ‘Ali, Wali Qizil, Qaracha, Halahil,
‘Ashiq the House-steward, Shaikh ‘Ali, Kitta (Beg Kuhdur), Gujir
Khan, Hasan ‘Ali Siwadz. These were to present themselves at
the Sultan’s call and muster and not to transgress his word by road
or in halt? The messenger 3 appointed to carry these orders was
‘Abdu’l-ghaffar ; he was to deliver them first to Chin-timir SI,
then to go on and shew them to the afore-named begs who were
to present themselves with their troops at whatever place the
Sultan gave rendezvous (4#/ar) ;4 ‘Abdu’l-ghaffar himself was
to remain with the army and was to make dutiful representation
of slackness or carelessness if shewn by any person soever ; this
done, we should remove the offender from the circle of the
approved (muwapjah-jirgasi) and from his country or pargana.
These orders having been entrusted to ‘Abdu’l-ghaffar, words-
of-mouth were made known to him and he was given leave to go.

(2. News of the loss of Bihar reaches Dhiilpir.)

(Jan. 9th) On the eve of Sunday the 28th of the month
(Rabz‘ IT.) we crossed the Jin (Jumna) at the 6th gari of the
3rd watch (2.15 a.m.) and started for the Lotus-garden of Dilpiir.
The 3rd watch was near* (Sunday mid-day) when we reached it.
Places were assigned on the border of the garden, where begs
and the household might build or make camping-grounds for
themselves.

(Jan. 13th) On Thursday the 3rd of the first Jumada, a place
was fixed in the s.e. of the garden for a Hot-bath ; the ground
was to be levelled ; I ordered a plinth (?) (Zursz) erected on the
levelled ground, and a Bath to be arranged, in one room of which
was to be a reservoir 10 X I0,

On this same day Khalifa sent from Agra dutiful letters of
Qazi Jia and Bir-sing Deo, saying it had been heard said that
Iskandar’s son Mahmiid (Zaz) had taken Bihar (town). This
news decided for getting the army to horse.

(Jan. 14th) On Friday (Jumada I. 4th), we rode out from the
Lotus-garden at the 6th gari (8.15 a.m.) ; at the Evening Prayer
we reached Agra. We met Muhammad-i-zaman Mirza on the
road who would have gone to Dilpir, Chin-timiir also who must
have been coming into Agra?

(Jan. 15th) On Saturday (5th) the counselling begs having
been summoned, it was settled to ride eastwards on Thursday
the 10th of the month (Jan. 27st).

(7. News of Badakhshan.)

On this same Saturday letters came from Kabul with news
that Humayin, having mustered the army on that side (Tra-
montana), and joined SI. Wais to himself, had set out with
40,000 men for Samarkand ;3 on this S]. Wais’ younger brother

meaning approach, but is taken by some other workers to mean ‘‘ near its end”.

as the “‘also” (4am) suggests.

3 To the above news the Akéar-nama adds the important item reported by Humayin,
that there was talk of peace. Babur replied that, if the time for negotiation were not
past, Humayiin was to make peace until such time as the affairs of Hindistan were
cleared off. This is followed in the A.N. by a seeming quotation from Babur’s letter,
saying in effect that he was'about to leave Hindiistan, and that his followers in Kabul
and Tramontana must prepare for the expedition against Samarkand which would be
made on his own arrival. None of the above matter is now with the Badzr-nama ;

(kk. Babur starts for the East.)

(Jan. 20th) On Thursday the 10th of the first Jumada, I set
out for the East after the 3rd gari (cir. 7.10a.m.), crossed Jin
by boat a little above Jalisir, and went to the Gold-scattering-
garden.3_ It was ordered that the standard (¢#gh), drum, stable
and all the army-folk should remain on the other side of the
water, opposite to the garden, and that persons coming for an
interview 4 should cross by boat.

(4. Arrivals.)

(Jan. 22nd) On Saturday (z2th) Isma‘l Mita, the Bengal
envoy brought the Bengali’s offering (Nasrat Shah’s), and waited
on me in Hindistan fashion, advancing to within an arrow’s
flight, making his reverence, and retiring. They then put on him
the due dress of honour (4/z‘lat) which people call * * * *5, and

either it was there once, was used by Abii’l-fazl and lost before the Persian trss. were
made ; or Abi’l-fazl used Babur’s original, or copied, letter itself. That desire for
peace prevailed is shewn by several matters :—Tahmisp, the victor, asked and obtained
the hand of an Adzbeg in marriage ; Aizbeg envoys came to Agra, and with them Turk
Khwajas having a mission likely to have been towards peace (f. 3574); Babur’s wish
for peace is shewn above and on f. 359 in a summarized letter to Humayin. (Cf. Abi’l-
ghazi’s Shajarat-i- Turk [Histoire des Mongols, Désmaisons’ trs. p. 216]; Akbar-ndma,
H.B.’s trs. i, 270.)

A here-useful slip of reference is made by the translator of the Akbar-nama (2.c. n. 3)
to the Fragment (AZémozires ii, 456) instead of to the Babur-2ama translation (A/émotres
ii, 381). The utility of the slip lies in its accompanying comment that deC.’s translation
is in closer agreement with the Assar-naGma than with Babur’s words. Thus the
Akbar-nama passage is brought into comparison with what it is now safe to regard as
its off-shoot, through Turki and French, in the Fragment. When the above comment
on their resemblance was made, we were less assured than now as to the genesis of
the Fragment (Index 5.2. Fragment).

worn, and a belt with clasps. Through Mulla Bihishti were
sent to Hind-al an inlaid dagger with belt, an inlaid ink-stand,
a stool worked in mother-o’pearl, a tunic and a girdle,3 together
with the alphabet of the Baburi script and fragments (gzta‘lar)
written in that script. To Humayiin were sent the translation
(tarjuma) and verses made in Hindistan.4 To Hind-al and
Khwaja Kalan also the translation and verses were sent. They
were sent too to Kamran, through Mirza Beg Taghai, together
with head-lines (sar-khat) in the Baburi script.5

and avoiding the ravine district of the Jumna. What the boat-journey will have been
between high banks and round remarkable bends can be learned from the G. of I. and
Neave’s District Gazetteer of Mainpiiri. Rapri is on the road from Firiizabad to the
ferry for Bateswar, where a large fair is held annually. (It is misplaced further east
in the I.S. Map of 1900.) There are two Fathpirs, n.e. of Rapri.

4 auliugh tighdining tibi. Here it suits to take the Turki word ¢#ghai to mean
bend of a river, and as referring to the one shaped (on the map) like a soda-water
bottle, its neck close to Rapri. Babur avoided it by taking boat below its mouth.—
In neither Persian translation has ¢#ghdi been read to mean a bend of a river ; the
first has az payan ritia Rapri, perhaps referring to the important ford (fdya) ; the
second has az zir bulandi kalin Rapri, perhaps referring toa height at the meeting of
the bank of the ravine down which the road to the ford comes, with the high bank
of the river. Three examples of ¢#ghai or tiigai [a synonym given by Dictionaries],
can be seen in Abii’l-ghazi’s Shajrat-i-Turk, Fraehn’s imprint, pp. 106, 107, 119
(Désmaisons’ trs. pp. 204, 205, 230). In each instance Désmaisons renders it by
coude, elbow, but one of the examples may need reconsideration, since the word has
the further meanings of wood, dense forest by the side of a river (Vambéry), prairie
(Zenker), and reedy plain (Shaw).

5 Blochmann describes the apparatus for marking lines to guide writing (A.-i-A.
trs. p.52 n.5) :—On a card of the size of the page to be written on, two vertical lines
are drawn within an inch of the edges; along these lines small holes are pierced at
regular intervals, and through these a string is laced backwards and forwards, care
being taken that the horizontal strings are parallel. Over the lines of string the pages
are placed and pressed down ; the strings then mark the paper sufficiently to guide the
writing.

the explanation of the uncertain words ¢arkib khati. The “‘translation ” (¢arjeza),
mentioned in the passage quoted above, is the Walidiyyah-risala, the first item of the
Diwan, in which it is entered on crowded pages, specially insufficient for the larger

(Feb. 6th) Opposite Jakin,? one of the Rapri parganas, we
Fol. 358. had the boats drawn to the bank and just spent the night in
them. We had them moved on from that place before the dawn
(Sunday 27th), after having gone through the Morning Prayer.
When I was again on board, Pay-master Sl. Muhammad came,
bringing a servant of Khwaja Kalan, Shamsu’d-din Muhammad,
from whose letters and information particulars about the affairs of
Kabul became known.3 Mahdi Khwaja also came when I was in
the boat.4 At the Mid-day Prayer I landed ina garden opposite
Etawa, there bathed (gus) in the Jin, and fulfilled the duty of
prayer. Moving nearer towards Etawa, we sat down in that
same garden under trees on a height over-looking the river, and
there set the braves to amuse us Food ordered by Mahdi
Khwaja, was set before us. At the Evening Prayer we crossed
the river; at the bed-time one we reached camp.
There was a two or three days’ delay on that ground both to
collect the army, and to write letters in answer to those brought ;
by Shamsu’d-din Muhammad.

Several remaining letters for Kabul were written on this same
ground. One to Humayiin was to this purport :—If the work
have not yet been done satisfactorily, stop the raiders and thieves
thyself; do not let them embroil the peace now descending
amongst the peoples.’ Again, there was this :—I have made
Kabul a crown-domain, let no son of mine covet it. Again :—that
I had summoned Hind-al.

Kamran, for his part, was written to about taking the best of
care in intercourse with the Shah-zada,? about my bestowal on
himself of Multan, making Kabul a crown-domain, and the coming
of my family and train.3

As my letter to Khwaja Kalan makes several particulars
known, it is copied in here without alteration :—‘4

[Copy oF A LETTER TO KHWAJA KALAN.]

“ After saying ‘Salutation to Khwaja Kalan’, the first matter
is that Shamsu’d-din Muhammad has reached Etawa, and that
the particulars about Kabul are known.”

“Boundless and infinite is my desire to go to those parts.5
Matters are coming to some sort of settlement in Hindistan ;
there is hope, through the Most High, that the work here will soon
bearranged. This work brought to order, God willing! my start
will be made at once.”

“How should a person forget the pleasant things of those
countries, especially one who has repented and vowed to sin no
more? How should he banish from his mind the permitted
flavours of melons and grapes? Taking this opportunity,®

Sarai Baburpir from having been Babur’s halting-place. They are 24m. to the s.e. of
Etawa, on the old road for Kalpi. Near the name Baburpir in the Gazetteer Map
there is Muhuri (Miri ?) ; there is little or no doubt that Sarai Baburpir represents the
camping-ground Miri-and-Adisa.

* This connects with Kitin-qara’s complaints of the frontier-begs (f. 361), and with
the talk of peace (f. 3564).

? This injunction may connect with the desired peace ; it will have been prompted
by at least a doubt in Babur’s mind as to Kamran’s behaviour perhaps e.g. in manifested
dislike for a Shia‘. Concerning the style Shah-zada see f. 358, p. 643, n. I.

3 Kamran’s mother Gul-rukh Begchzh will have been of the party who will have
tried in Kabul to forward her son’s interests.

4 £.348, p. 624, n.2.

5 Kabul and Tramontana.

© Presumably that of Shamsu’d-din Muhammad’s mission. One of Babur’s couplets
expresses longing for the fruits, and also for the ‘‘running waters”, of lands other
than Hindiistan, with conceits recalling those of his English contemporaries in verse,
as indeed do several others of his short poems (Rampur Diwan Plate xvii A.).

a melon was brought to me; to cut andeatit affected me strangely ;
I was all tears!”
“ The unsettled state’ of Kabul had already been written of
Fol. 359% tome. After thinking matters over, my choice fell on this :—
How should a country hold together and be strong (smarbit
u mazbut), if it have seven or eight Governors? Under this
aspect of the affair, I have summoned my elder sister (Khan-
zada) and my wives to Hindustan, have made Kabul and its
neighbouring countries a crown-domain, and have written in
this sense to both Humayiin and Kamran. Let a capable person
take those letters to the Mirzas. As you may know already, I had '
written earlier to them with the same purport. About the safe-
guarding and prosperity of the country, there will now be no
excuse, and not a word.to say. Henceforth, if the town-wall ?
be not solid or subjects not thriving, if provisions be not in store
or the Treasury not full, it will all be laid on the back of the
inefficiency of the Pillar-of-the State.” 3
“The things that must be done are specified below ; for some
of them orders have gone already, one of these being, ‘ Let ;

First, the repair of the fort ; again :—the provision of stores ;

The place got the name of Belvedere,3 because it faces the ford
and gives a first-rate view. The best of young trees must be
planted there, lawns arranged, and borders set with sweet-herbs

Through renouncement of wine bewildered am I ;
How to work know I not, so distracted am I ;
While others repent and make vow to abstain,

I have vowed to abstain, and repentant am I.

A witticism of Banai’s came back to my mind:—One day when
he had been joking in ‘Ali-sher Beg’s presence, who must have
been wearing a jacket with buttons,’ ‘Ali-sher Beg said, ‘Thou
makest charming jokes ; but for the buttons, I would give thee
the jacket; they are the hindrance (smanz').” Said Banai, ‘What
hindrance are buttons ? It is button-holes (#é@dagz) that hinder.’ ?
Let responsibility for this story lie on the teller! hold me excused
for it ; for God’s sake do not be offended by it.3 Again :—that
quatrain was made before last year, and in truth the longing and
craving for a wine-party has been infinite and endless for two
years past, so much so that sometimes the craving for wine
brought me to the verge of tears. Thank God! this year that
trouble has passed from my mind, perhaps by virtue of the
blessing and sustainment of versifying the translation.4 Do thou
also renounce wine! If had with equal associates and boon-
companions, wine and company are pleasant things; but with
whom canst thou now associate ? with whom drink wine? Ifthy
boon-companions are Sher-i-ahmad and Haidar-quli, it should
not be hard for thee to forswear wine. So much said, I salute
thee and long to see thee.” 5

The above letter was written on Thursday the Ist of the latter
Jumada (Fed. roth). It affected me greatly to write concerning

* The surface retort seems connected with the jacket, perhaps with a request for

the gift of it.
_ 7 Clearly what recalled this joke of Banai’s long-silent, caustic -tongue was that
its point lay ostensibly ina baffled wish—in ‘Ali-sher’s professed desire to be generous
and a professed impediment, which linked in thought with Babur’s*desire for wine,
baffled by his abjuration. So much Bandai’s smart verbal retort shows, but beneath
this is the double-entendre which cuts at the Beg as miserly and as physically impotent,
a defect which gave point to another jeer at his expense, one chronicled by Sam Mirza
and translated in Hammer-Purgstall’s Geschichte von schinen Redehiinste Persiens, art.
CLV. (Cf. f. 179-80, )—The word mddagi is used metaphorically for a button-hole ;
like na-mardt, it carries secondary meanings, miserliness, impotence, efc. (Cf.
Wollaston’ s English- Persian Dictionary s.n. button-hole, where only we have found
mddagi with this sense. )

5 The Ist Pers. trs. expresses ‘‘all these jokes”, thus including with the double-
meanings of mddagi, the jests of the quatrain.

a The Ist Pers. trs. fills out Babur’s allusive phrase here with ‘‘ of the Walidtyyak”’.
His wording allows the inference that what he versified was a prose Turki translation
of a probably Arabic original.

5 Erskine comments here on the non-translation into Persian of Babur’s letters.
Many MSS., however, contain a translation (f. 348, p. 624, n. 2 and E.’s n. £. 3776).

Kamalu’d-din Q7a@q,3 with things written concerning the behaviour
of the begs of the (Balkh) border, their intercourse with himself,

Qiagq, and orders were issued to the begs of the border to put an
end to raiding and thieving, to behave well and to maintain
intercourse with Balkh. These orders were entrusted to Kitin

A letter, accepting excuse for the belated arrival of Hasan

Jumada II. 6th (cf. last note), the distance entered as done on Wednesday would
locate the halting-place somewhere near the Akbarpir of later name, which stands on
aroad and at a ferry. Butifthe army did a stage on Tuesday, of which Babur omits
mention, Wednesday’s march might well bring him opposite to Hamirpir and to the

attention.—Local encroachment by the river, which is recorded in the District

I going by boat direct, and after 4 kurohs done (8m.), halt was
made at Koh.2 Our ground, being so near, was reached quite
early. After awhile, we seated ourselves inside 3 a boat where
we ate ma‘jin. We invited the honoured Khwaja ‘Abdu’sh-
shahid 4 who was said to be in Nir Beg’s quarters (aw), invited
also Mulla Mahmid (Fardé7?), bringing him from Mulla ‘Ali
Khan’s. After staying for some time on that spot, we crossed
the river, and on the other side, set wrestlers to wrestle. In
opposition to the rule of gripping the strongest first, Dost-i-yasin

Babur’s title for his book was Wagdi‘, and not Baber-nama which, indeed, Teufel
describes as the Kazaner Ausgabe adoptirte Titel. Babur-ndma, however, is the
title [or perhaps, merely scribe’s name] associated both with Kehr’s text and with the
Haidarabad Codex.—I have found no indication of the selection by Babur of any
title ; he makes no mention of the matter and where he uses the word wagaz* or its
congeners, it canbe readasacommon noun. In his colophon to the Rampur Diwan,
it is a parallel of ash‘ar, poems. Judging from what is found in the A/zdiz, it may
be right to infer that, if he had lived to complete his book—now broken off s.a.
QI4AH. (f.2164)—he would have been explicit as to its title, perhaps also as to his
grounds for choosing it. Such grounds would have found fitting mention in a preface
to the now abrupt opening of the Babur-nama (f. 16), and if the Malfuzat-2-timiri be
Timiw’s authentic autobiography, this book might have been named as an ancestral
example influencing Babur to write his own. Nothing against the authenticity of the
Malfuzat can be inferred from the circumstance that Babur does not name it, because
the preface in which such mention would be in harmony with e.g. his Walidiyyah
preface, was never written. It might accredit the A/a//azdt to collate passages having
common topics, as they appear in the Babur-ndma, Malfizat-t-timiri and Zafar-
nama (cf. E. & D.’s H. of I. iv, §59 for a discussion by Dr. Sachau and Prof. Dowson
on the Afalfazat). (Cf. Z.D.M. xxxvii, p.184, Teufel’s art. Babur und Abi’ l-fazl ;

by a spy who had gone out at the Mid-day Prayer from where
we were ; and a dutiful letter, agreeing with what the spy had
reported, came from Taj Khan Savang-khani between the After-
noon and Evening Prayers. S!. Muhammad gave the following
particulars :—that the rebels on reaching Chunar seemed to have
laid siege to it and to have done a little fighting, but had risen
in disorderly fashion when they heard of our approach ; that
Afghans who had crossed the river for Benares, had turned back
in like disorder; that two of their boats had sunk in crossing and
a body of their men been drowned.

to a scribe’s skip, but may result from the loss of a folio. What I have entered
above between the asterisks is translated from the Kehr-Ilminsky text ; it isin the

the swimming episode it is not in order and that the account of the swim across the
Ganges may be a survival of the now missing record of 934 AH. (f. 339). It issingular
that the Pers. trss. make no mention of Piag or of Sir-auliya ; their omission arouses
speculation, as to inwhich text, the Turki or Persian, it was first tried to fill what remains
a gap in the Hai. Codex. A second seeming sign of disorder is the incomplete
sentence Ytrigha 4ilib, which is noted below. A third is the crowd of incidents now
standing under ‘‘ Tuesday E A fourth, and an important matter, is that on grounds
noted at the end of the swimming passage (p.655 n.3) it is doubtful whether that

(March 7th?) Next day (Monday 26th?) we remained on the
same ground.

(March Sth?) On Tuesday (27¢h?) we marched on.

Opposite the camp was what may be an island,* large and
verdant. I went over by boat to visit it, returning to the boat
during the Ist watch (6-9a.m.). While I rode carelessly along
the ravine (ar) of the river, my horse got to where it was fissured
and had begun to give way. I leapt off at once and flung myself
on the bank; even the horse did not go down; probably, however,
if | had stayed on its back, it and I would have gone down
together.

On this same day, I swam the Gang-river (Ganges), counting
every stroke ;? I crossed with 33, then, without resting, swam
back. I had swum the other rivers, Gang had remained to do.3

We reached the meeting of the waters of Gang and Jin at the
Evening Prayer, had the boat drawn to the Piag side, and got
to camp at I watch, 4 garis (10.30p.m.).

(March 9th) On Wednesday (/Jumada If. 28th) from the st
watch onwards, the army began to cross the river Jin ; there were
420 boats.

(March 11th) On Friday, the Ist of the month of Rajab,
I crossed the river.

3 The above account of Babur’s first swim across the Ganges which is entered. under
date Jumada II. 27th, 935 AH. (March 8th, 1529AD.), appears misplaced, since he
mentions under date Rajab 25th, 935AH. (April 4th, 1529An. f. 3664), that he had
swum the Ganges at Baksara (Buxar) a year before, z.¢. on or close to Rajab 25th,
934AH. (April 15th, 1528apD.). Nothing in his writings shews that he was near
Piag (Allahabad) in 934AH. ; nothing indisputably connects the swimming episode
with the “‘ Tuesday” below which it now stands ; there is no help given by dates.
One supposes Babur would take his first chance to swim the Ganges ; this was offered
at Qanauj (f. 336), but nothing in the short record of that time touchesthe topic. The
next chance would be after he was in Aid, when, by an unascertained route, perhaps
down the Ghogra, he made his way to Baksara where he says (f. 3666) he swam the
river. Taking into consideration the various testimony noted, [Index s.”. swimming]
there seems warrant for supposing that this swimming passage is a survival of the
missing record of 934 AH. (f. 339). Cf. f.3776, p.680 and n. 2 for another surmised
survival of 934 AH.

for Bihar began along the bank of Jin. After 54urohs (10m.)
done, halt was made at Lawain.t I went by boat. The people
of the army were crossing the Jiin up to today. They were
ordered to put the culverin-carts? which had been landed at
Adampir, into boats again and to bring them on by water from
Piag.

On this ground we set wrestlers to wrestle. Dost-i-yasin
-khair gripped the boatman Champion of Lahor; the contest
was stubborn ; it was with great difficulty that Dost gave the
throw. A head-to-foot was bestowed on each.

(March 15th and 16th) People said that ahead of us was
a swampy, muddy, evil river called Tiis3 In order to examine
the ford *4 and repair the road, we waited two days (Tuesday
Ramzan 5th and Wednesday 6th) on this ground. For the horses
and camels a ford was found higher up, but people said laden carts
could not get through it because of its uneven, stony bottom.
They were just ordered to get them through.

(March 17th) On Thursday (7th) we marched on. I myself
went by boat down to where the Tiis meets the Gang (Ganges),
there landed, thence rode up the Tis, and, at the Other Prayer,

* The march, beginning on the Jumna, is now along the united rivers.

* garb-zanlik arabalar. Vere the carts are those carrying the guns. __

3 From the particulars Babur gives about the Tits (Tons) and Karma-nasa, it would
seem that he had not passed them last year, an inference supported by what is known
of his route in that year: —He came from Giialiar to the Kanar-passage (f. 336), there
crossed the Jumna and went direct to Qanauj (f. 335), above Qanauj bridged the
Ganges, went on to Bangarmau (f. 338), crossed the Giimti and went to near the
junction of the Ghogra and Sarda (f. 3384). The next indication of his route is that
he is at Baksara, but whether he reached it by water down the Ghogra, as his
meeting with Muh. Ma‘rif Farmali suggests (f. 377), or by land, nothing shews. From
Baksara (f. 366) he went up-stream to Chausa (f. 3654), on perhaps to Sayyidpar, 2m.
from the mouth of the Gimti, and there left the Ganges for Janpiir (f. 365). I have
found nothing about his return route to Agra ; it seems improbable that he would go so
far south as to near Piag; a more northerly and direct road to Fathpar and Sarai
Baburpiir may have been taken.—Concerning Babur’s acts in 934.AH. the following
item, (met with since I was working on 934 AH. ), continues his statement (f. 3384) that
he spent a few days near Aiid (Ajodhya) to settle its affairs. The D.G. of Hysabaa
(H. E. Nevill) p. 173 says ‘‘In 1528 Ap. Babur came to Ajodhya (Aid) and halted
a week. Ile destroyed the ancient temple” (marking the birth-place of Rama) ‘‘and
on its site built a mosque, still known as Babur’s Mosque . . ._ It has two inscrip-
tions, one on the outside, one on the pulpit ; both are in Persian ; and bear the date
935Au.” This date may be that of the completion of the building. —( Corrigendum :—
On f. 339 n. 1, Ihave too narrowly restricted the use of the name Sarjii. Babur used it
to describe what the maps of Arrowsmith and Johnson shew, and not only what the

Gasetteer of India map of the United Provinces does. It applies to the Sarda (f. 339)
as Babur uses it when writing of the fords.)

(March 23rd) On Wednesday (73th) we marched from that
ground. I visited the fort of Chunar, and dismounted about
one kuroh beyond it.

During the days we were marching from Piag, painful boils
had come out on my body. While we were on this ground, an
Ottoman Turk (Rimi) used a remedy which had been recently
discovered in Rim. He boiled pepper in a pipkin ; I held the
sores in the steam and, after steaming ceased, laved them with
the hot water. The treatment lasted 2 sidereal hours.

While we were on this ground, a person said he had seen
tiger and rhinoceros on an dra/5 by the side of the camp.

(March 24th?) In the morning (z74¢h?), we made the hunting-
circle ® on that @ra/, elephants also being brought. Neither tiger
nor rhino appeared ; one wild buffalo came out at the end of
the line. A bitter wind rising and the whirling dust being
very troublesome, I went back to the boat and in it to the camp
which was 24urohs (4m.) above Banaras.

(uu. News of the Afghans.)

(March 25th(?) and 26th) Having heard there were many
elephants in the Chunar jungles, I had left (Thursday’s) ground
thinking to hunt them, but Taj Khan bringing the news (/77day
15th(?)) that Mahmid Khan (Lédz) was near the Son-water,
I summoned the begs and took counsel as to whether to fall
upon him suddenly. In the end it was settled to march on
continuously, fast‘ and far.

(March 27th) Marching on (Sunday 17th), we did 9 kurohs
(18m.), and dismounted at the Bilwah-ferry.?

(March 28th) On Monday night3 the 18th of the month,
Tahir was started for Agra from this camp (Bilwah-ferry), taking
money-drafts for the customary gifts of allowance and lodging *
to those on their way from Kabul.

Before dawn next morning (Monday) I went on by boat.
When we came to where the Gii-water (Gimti) which is the
water of Jiinpiir, meets the Gang-water (Ganges), I went a little
way up it and back. Narrower though it is, it has no ford; the
army-folk crossed it (last year) by boat, by raft, or by swimming
their horses.

To look at our ground ofa year ago,® from which we had started
for Jinpir,7 I went to about a £u7o0h lower than the mouth of
the Jiinpiir-water (Gumti). A favourable wind getting up behind,
our larger boat was tied to a smaller Bengali one which, spreading
its sail, made very quick going. Two garis of day remained
(5.15 p.m.) when we had reached that ground (Sayyidpur ?), we
went on without waiting there, and by the Bed-time Prayer had
got to camp, which was a Auroh above Madan-Benares,® long
before the boats following us. Mughil Beg had been ordered to

came also a dutiful letter from ‘Abdu’l-‘aziz A7aster-of-the-horse,
which had been written in Lahor on the 20th of the latter Jumada

Shadman (Joyous), threw him, to Muhsin’s shame and vexation.
The (professional) wrestlers came also and set to.

ford through the Karma-nasa-water. I rode up it for not less

went to the camp below Chausa.

Today I used the pepper remedy again; it must have been

where the army had been seated many days last year,5 we went
over to look at it. Between 40 and 50 landing-steps had been
then made on the bank ; of them the upper two only were left,
the river having destroyed the rest. Mayan was eaten after

aiuitud is caused by finding that while here de Courtcille agrees with Erskine in taking
it to mean swimming, he varies later (f. 3730) to appuyés sur une piece de bors. Taking
the Persian translations of three passages about crossing water into consideration (p. 655
after f. 3630, f. 3664 (here), f.3734), and also the circumstances that E. and de C. are
once in agreement and that Erskine worked with the help of Oriental meznshis, I incline
to think that dastak bi/a does express swimming. —The question of its precise meaning
bears on one concerning Babur’s first swim across the Ganges (p. 655, n. 3). —Perhaps
I should say, however, that if the sentence quoted at the head of this note stood alone,
without the extraneous circumstances supporting the reading of dastak bila to mean
swimming, I should incline to read it as stating that Babur went on foot through the
water, feeling his footing with a pole (das¢aé), and that his followers rode through the
ford after him. Nothing in the quoted passage suggests that the horses and camels
swam. But whether the Ganges was fordable at Baksara in Babur’s time, is beyond
surmise.

are nowhere specified ; one is summarized merely on f. 365. Theincomplete sentence
of the Turki text (szfra) needs their specification at this place, and an explicit state-
ment of them would have made clearer the political relations of Babur with Nasrat
Shah.—A folio may have been lost from Babur’s manuscript ; it might have specified
the articles, and also have said something leading to the next topic of the diary, now
needing preliminaries, w7z. that of the Mirza’s discontent with his new appointment,

this several braves were inscribed and several others were made
his own retainers.

(April 9th)* On Saturday the Ist of the month of Sha‘ban, we
left that ground where we had been for 3 or 4 days. I rode to
visit Bhijptr and Bihiya,? thence went to camp.

Muhammad ‘Ali and the others, who had been sent out for
news, after beating a body of pagans as they went along, reached
the place where SI. Mahmiid (Lad) had been with perhaps 2000
men. He had heard of our reconnaissance, had broken up, killed
two elephants of his, and marched off. He seemed to have left
braves and an elephant 3 scout-fashion; they made no stand when
our men came up but took to flight. Ours unhorsed a few of his,
cut one head off, brought in a few good men alive.

(April roth) We moved on next day (Sunday 2nd), 1 going by
boat. From our today’s ground Muhammad-i-zaman M. crossed
(his army) over the river (Son), leaving none behind. We spent
2 or 3 days on this ground in order to put his work through and
get him off.

sentative he will have wished to leave in Bihar when he himself went to his western
dominions, sufficiently explain the bestowal of this sign of sovereignty.

breadth of the river. They could not move on, however, so-
arranged, because the water was here shallow, there deep, here
swift, there still. A crocodile (gharid/) shewing itself, a terrified
fish leaped so high as to fall into a boat; it was caught and
brought to me.

When we were nearing our ground, we gave the boats names :—
a large* one, formerly the Baburi,? which had been built in Agra
before the Holy-battle with Sanga, was named Asaish (Repose).3
Another, which Araish Khan had built and presented to me this
year before our army got to horse, one in which I had had a
platform set up on our way to this ground, was named Araish
(Ornament). Another, a good-sized one presented to me by
Jalalu’d-din Shargi, was named the Gunjaish (Capacious) ; in it
I had ordered a second platform set up, on the top of the one
already in it. To a little skiff, having a chaukandi,4 one used for
every task (har dish) and duty, was given the name Farmaish
(Commissioned).

me know they were coming,‘ they had done some straight fighting
to get away from the Bengalis, had crossed the river,5 reached
Bihar, and were said now to be on their way to me.

This command was given today for the Bengal envoy Isma‘l

peace existed between us and the Bengali (Nasrat Shah A/ghan),
and as, for the sake of a benediction, peace was our firstendeavour
whenever such work was toward as we were now on, we kept to
our rule, notwithstanding his unmannerly conduct in setting
himself on our road ;! we associated Mulla Mazhab with his
envoy Isma‘il Mita, spoke once more about those three articles
(fasl soz), and decided to let the envoy go.

(April 18th) On Monday (Zo¢h) when the Bengal envoy came
to wait on me, he was let know that he had his leave, and what
follows was mentioned :?—“ We shall be going to this side and
that side, in pursuit of our foe, but no hurt or harm will be done
to any dependency of yours. Asone of those three articles said,3
when you have told the army of Kharid to rise off our road and
to go back to Kharid, let a few Turks be joined with it to reassure
these Kharid people and to escort them to their own place.* If
they quit not the ferry-head, if they cease not their unbecoming
words, they must regard as their own act any ill that befalls
them, must count any misfortune they confront as the fruit of
their own words.”

was put on the Bengal envoy, gifts were bestowed on him and
his leave to go was given.

dated by his deputy as for 1529 AD. (Déstrict Gazetteer of Ballia (H.R. Nevill), and
D.G. of Saran (L. LS, O’Malley), Historical Chapters).

On this same day I rode southward in the Ari (Arrah) pargana
to visit the sheets of lotus? near Ari. During the excursion
Shaikh Giran brought me fresh-set lotus-seeds, first-rate little

on it. Masses of trees could be seen down-stream ; ‘“ Munir is

the Son, went 2 or 3 £urohs down it, traversed the Munir orchards,
made the circuit of the tomb, returned to the Son-bank, made
ablution, went through the Mid-day Prayer before time, and
made forcamp. Some of our horses, being fat,+ had fallen behind ;
some were worn out; a few people were left to gather them

pressure ; but for this many would have been ruined.

3 Shaikh Yahya had been the head of the Chishti Order. His son (d. 782 AH.—

discursive detail which pleads in my excuse that those who know Babur well cannot
but see in his grandson’s character and success the fruition of his mental characteristics
and of his labours in Hindistan. (For Sharafu’d-din 2/uniri, cf. Khasinate l-asfiya
ii, 390-92 ; and Ayin-i-akbari s.n.)

‘ Kostenko’s 7urkistan Region describes a regimen for horses which Babur will

have seen in practice in his native land, one which prevented the defect that hindered
his at Munir from accomplishing more than some 30 miles before mid-day.

the return journey from Munir to the camp was therefore 12kurohs
(24m.). In addition to this were some 15-16 kurohks done in
visiting this and that place ; so that the whole excursion was one
of some 30 4urohs(60m.). Six garis of the Ist night-watch had

(aaa. Plan of the approaching battle with the Bengal army.)

On the same day the Turk and Hind amirs were summoned
for a consultation about crossing Gang (Ganges), and matters
found settlement at this? :—that Ustad ‘Ali-quli should collect
mortar, firzngi,3 and culverin* to the point of rising ground
between the rivers Sari and Gang, and, having many match-
lockmen with him, should incite to battle from that place ; 5 that

The distance from Munir to the bank of the Ganges will have been considerably
longer in Babur’s day than now because of the change of the river’s course through
its desertion of the Burh-ganga channel (cf. next note).

2 In trying to locate the site of Babur’s coming battle with the forces of Nasrat
Shah, it should be kept in mind that previous to the 18th century, and therefore,
presumably, in his day, the Ganges flowed in the ‘‘ Burh-ganga” (Old Ganges) channel
which now is closely followed by the western boundary of the Ballia sargana of Dii-aba ;
that the Ganges and Ghogra will have met where this old channel entered the bed of
the latter river ; and also, as is seen from Babur’s narrative, that above the confluence
the Ghogra will have been confined toa narrowed channel. When the Ganges flowed
in the Burh-ganga channel, the now Ballia pargaxa of Di-aba was a sub-division of
Bihiya and continuous with Shahabad. From it in Bihiya Babur crossed the Ganges
into Kharid, doing this at a place his narrative locates as some 2miles from the con-
fluence. Cf. D.G. of Ballia, pp. 9, 192-3, 206, 213. It may be observed that the
former northward extension of Bihiya to the Burh-ganga channel explains Babur’s
estimate (f. 370) of the distance from Munir to. his camp on the Ganges; his 124.
(24m.) may then have been correct ; it is now too high.

3 De Courteille, pzerrier, which may bea balista. Babur’s writings give no indica-
tion of other than stone-ammunition for any projectile-engine or fire-arm. Cf. R. W. F.
Payne-Gallwey’s Projectile-throwing engines of the ancients.

4 Sir R. W. F. Payne-Gallwey writes in Ze Cross-bow (p. 40 and p. 41) what may
apply to Babur’s zarb-zan (culverin ?) and ¢ufang (matchlock), when he describes the
larger culverin as a heavy hand-gun of from 16-181b., asused by the foot-soldier and
requiring the assistance of an attendant to work it ; also when he says that it became
the portable arquebus which was in extensive use in Europe by the Swiss in 1476 aD. ;
and that between 1510 and 1520 the arquebus described was superseded by what is
still seen amongst remote tribes in India, a matchlock arquebus.

5 The two positions Babur selected for his guns would seem to have been opposite
two ferry-heads, those, presumably, which were blocked against his pursuit of Biban
and Bayazid. ‘Ali-quli’s emplacement will have been on the high bank of old alluvium
of south-eastern Kharid, overlooking the narrowed channel demanded by Babur’s

Mustafa, he also having many matchlockmen, should get his
material and implements ready on the Bihar side of Gang, a little
below the meeting of the waters and opposite to where on an
island the Bengalis had an elephant and a mass of boats tied
up, and that he should engage battle from this place;* that
Muhammad-i-zaman Mirza and the others inscribed for the work
should take post behind Mustafa as his reserve; that both for
Ustad ‘Ali-quli and Mustafa shelters (salar) for the culverin-
firers should be raised by a mass of spadesmen and coolies (kahar)
under appointed overseers; that as soon as these shelters were
ready, ‘Askari and the sultans inscribed for the work should cross
quickly at the Haldi-passage? and come down on the enemy ;
that meantime, as Sl. Junaid and Qazi Jia had given information
about a crossing-place3 8 kurohs (16m.) higher up,+ Zard-rii(Pale-
face ?) should go with a few raftsmen and some of the people of
the Sultan, Mahmiid Khan W#hani and Qazi Jia to look at that
crossing ; and that, if crossing there were, they should go over
at once, because it was rumoured that the Bengalis were planning
to post men at the Haldi-passage.

A dutiful letter from Mahmid Khan the Military-collector
(shigdar) of Sikandarpir now came, saying that he had collected
as many as 50 boats at the Haldi-passage and had given wages
to the boatmen, but that these were much alarmed at the rumoured
approach of the Bengalis.

(April 30th) As time pressed 5 for crossing the Sari, I did not
wait for the return of those who had gone to look at the passage,

narrative, one pent in presumably by azar reefs such as there are in theregion. As
illustrating what the channel might have been, the varying breadth of the Ghogra along
the “Azamgarh District may be quoted, v¢z. from 10miles to 2/5m., the latter being
where, as in Kharid, there is old alluvium with 4azkar reefs preserving the banks. Cf.
Reid’s Report of Settlement Operations in ‘Azamgarh, Sikandarpur, and Bhadaon.—
Firishta gives Badrii as the name of one ferry (lith. ed. i. 210).

* Mustafa, like “Ali-quli, was to take the offensive by gun-fire directed on the opposite
bank. Judging from maps and also from the course taken by the Ganges through the
Burh-ganga channel and from Babur’s narrative, there seems to have been a narrow
reach of the Ghogra just below the confluence, as well as above.

? This ferry, bearing the common name Haldi (turmeric), is located by the course
of events as at no great distance above the enemy’s encampment above the confluence.
It cannot be the one of Sikandarpir West.

but on Saturday (2zs¢) summoned the begs for consultation and
said, “As it has been reported that there are (no?) crossing-places
(fords?) along the whole of the ground from Chatur-mik in Sikan-
darpir to Baraich and Aiid,* let us, while seated here, assign the
large force to cross at the Haldi-passage by boat and from there
to come down on the enemy ; let Ustad ‘Ali-quli and Mustafa
engage battle with gun (¢op), matchlock, culverin and firingz, and
by this draw the enemy out before ‘Askari comes up.? Let us
after crossing the river (Ganges) and assigning reinforcement to
Ustad ‘Ali-quli, take our stand ready for whatever comes; if
‘Askari’s troops get near, let us fling attack from where we are,
cross over and assault ; let Muhammad-i-zaman Mirza and those
appointed to act with him, engage battle from near Mustafa on
the other side of Gang.”

The matter having been left at this, the force for the north of
the Gang was formed into four divisions to start under ‘Askari’s
command for the Haldi-passage. One division was of ‘Askari
and his retainers ; another was Sl. Jalalu’d-din Sargi; another
was of the Aiizbeg sultans QOasim-i-husain Sultan, Bi-khitb Sultan
and Tang-aitmish Sultan, together with Mahmid Khan Vihani
of Ghazipir, Baba Qashqa’s Kiki, Tilmish Adzdeg, Qurban of
Chirkh, and the Darya-khanis led by Hasan Khan ; another was
of Misa Sl. (Farmii/z) and Sl. Junaid with what-not of the Jinpir
army, some 20,000 men. Officers were appointed to oversee the
getting of the force to horse that very night, that is to say, the
night of Sunday.3 :

(May rst) The army began to cross Gang at the dawn of
Sunday (Sha‘ban 22nd); 1 went over by boat at the Ist watch
(6a.m.). Zard-riii and his party came in at mid-day; the ford
itself they had not found but they brought news of boats and of

having met on the road the army getting near them.+

* The preceding sentence is imperfect and varies inthe MSS. The Ist Pers. trs., the
wording of which is often explanatory, says that there were zo passages, which, as there
were many ferries, will mean fords. The Haldi-guzr where ‘Askari was to cross, will
have been far below the lowest Babur mentions, zzz. Chatur-mik (Chaupara).

* This passage presupposes that guns in Kharid could hit the hostile camp in Saran.
If the river narrowed hereas it does further north, the Ghazi mortar, which seems to
have been the only one Babur had with him, would have carried across, since it threw
a stone 1,600 paces (gadam, f.309). Cf. Reid’s Report quoted above.

(May 3rd) On Tuesday (Sha‘ban 24th) we marched from
where the river had been crossed, went on for nearly one kurok
(2m.) and dismounted on the fighting-ground at the confluence.’
I myself went to enjoy Ustad ‘Ali-quli’s firing of culverin and
firingi; he hit two boats today with firingi-stones, broke them
and sank them. Mustafa did the same from his side. I had
the large mortar? taken to the fighting-ground, left Mulla Ghulam
to superintend the making of its position, appointed a body of
vasawals 3 and active braves to help him, went to an island facing
the camp and there ate ma‘uz.

Whilst still under the influence of the confection 4 I had the
boat taken to near the tents and there slept. A strange thing
happened in the night, a noise and disturbance arising about the
3rd watch (midnight) and the pages and others snatching up
pieces of wood from the boat, and shouting “Strike! strike!”
What was said to have led to the disturbance was that a night-
guard who was in the Farmaish along-side the Asaish in which
I was sleeping,5 opening his eyes from slumber, sees a man with
his hand on the Asaish as if meaning to climb into her. They
fall on him ;® he dives, comes up again, cuts at the night-guard’s
head, wounding it a little, then runs off at once towards the river.”
Once before, on the night we returned from Munir, one or two
night-guards had chased several Hindistanis from near the boats,
and had brought in two swords and a dagger of theirs. The Most
High had me in His Keeping !

laborious days, from inspiriting and forbidden confections.

has reversed the statement, made in the Turki, that Babur slept in the Asaish (not the
Farmiish).

935 AH.—SEP. 15TH 1528 To SEP. 5rH 1529 AD. 671

(May gth) At the dawn of Wednesday (257), I went in the
boat Gunjaish to near the stone-firing ground (¢ésh-atar-yir) and
there posted each soever to his work.

(66. Details of the engagement.)

Aughan-birdi AZughi/, leading not less than 1,000 men, had
been sent to get, in some way or other, across the river (Sari) one,
two, three hurohs (2, 4,6m.) higher up. A mass of foot-soldiers,
crossing from opposite ‘Askari’s camp," landed from 20-30 boats
on his road, presumably thinking to show their superiority, but
Atghan-birdi and his men charged them, put them to flight, took
a few and cut their heads off, shot many with arrows, and got
possession of 7 or 8 boats. Today also Bengalis crossed ina few
boats to Muhammad-i-zaman Mirza’s side, there landed and
provoked to fight. When attacked they fled, and three boat-
loads of them were drowned. One boat was captured and brought
tome. In this affair Baba the Brave went forward and exerted
himself excellently. ,

Orders were given that in the darkness of night the boats
Aighan-birdi had captured should be drawn? up-stream, and
that in them there should cross Muhammad Sl. Mirza, Yakka
Khwaja, Yinas-i-‘ali, Aighan-birdi and those previously assigned
to go with them.

Today came a man from ‘Askari to say that he had crossed
the [Sarii]-water, leaving none behind, and that he would come
down on the enemy at next day’s dawn, that is to say, on
Thursday’s. Here-upon those already ordered to cross over
were told to join ‘Askari and to advance upon the enemy
with him.

At the Mid-day Prayer a person came from Usta, saying
“The stone is ready; what is the order?” The order was, “Fire
this stone off ; keep the next till I come.” Going at the Other
Prayer in a very small Bengali skiff to where shelter (sa/jar)
had been raised, I saw Usta fire off one large stone and several

and above the main Bengal force.

clearly means to row, unless indeed a later rawan does so. The force meant to cross
in the boats taken up under cover of night was part of Babur’s own, no doubt.

small fir’ngi ones. Bengalis havea reputation for fire-working ; *
we tested it now; they do not fire counting to hit a particular
spot, but fire at random.

At this same Other Prayer orders were given to draw a few
boats up-stream along the enemy’s front. A few were got past
without a “ God forbid!” 2 from those who, all unprotected, drew
them up. Aisan-timiir Sl. and Tikhta-bigha Sl. were ordered
to stay at the place those boats reached, and to keep watch over
them. I got back to camp in the Ist night-watch of Thursday.3

Near midnight came news from (Atghan-birdi’s) boats which
were being drawn up-stream, “The force appointed had gone
somewhat ahead ; we were following, drawing the boats, when
the Bengalis got to know where we were drawing them and
attacked. A stone hit a boatman in the leg and broke it, we
could not pass on.”

(May 5th) At dawn on Thursday (Sha‘ban 26th) came the
news from those at the shelter, “ All the boats have come from
above.t The enemy’s horse has ridden to meet our approaching
army.” On this, I got our men mounted quickly and rode out
to above those boats5 that had been drawn up in the night.
A galloper was sent off with an order for Muhammad Sl. M. and
those appointed to cross with him, to do it at once and join
‘Askari. The order for Aisan-timir Sl. and Tikhta-bigha Sl.
who were above these boats,® was that they should busy them-
selves to cross. Baba S]. was not at his post.7

* Perhaps those which had failed to pass in the darkness; perhaps those from

reasons for their keeping abreast on the river with the troops in Saran, in order to
convey reinforcements or to provide retreat.

Aisan-timir Sl. at once crosses, in one boat with 30-40 of his
retainers who hold their horses by the mane at the boat-side.
A second boat follows. The Bengalis see them crossing and
start off a mass of foot-soldiers for them. To meet these go 7 or
8 of Aisan-timir Sl.’s retainers, keeping together, shooting off
arrows, drawing those foot-soldiers towards the Sultan who mean-
time is getting his men mounted; meantime also the second boat
is moving (rawa@n). When his 30-35 horsemen charge those
foot-soldiers, they put them well to flight. Aisan-timir did
distinguished work, first in crossing before the rest, swift, steady,
and without a “God forbid !”, secondly in his excellent advance,
with so few men, on such a mass of foot, and by putting these to
flight. Tiakhta-bigha Sl. also crossed. Then boats followed
one after another. Lahoris and Hindistanis began to cross
from their usual posts? by swimming or on bundles of reeds.?
Seeing how matters were going, the Bengalis of the boats opposite
the shelter (Mustafa’s), set their faces for flight down-stream.

Darwish-i-muhammad Saréan, Dost Lord-of-the-gate, Nir
Beg and several braves also went across the river. I made aman
gallop off to the Sultans to say, ‘“‘ Gather well together those who
cross, go close to the opposing army, take it in the flank, and
get to grips.” Accordingly the Sultans collected those who
crossed, formed up into 3 or 4 divisions, and started for the foe.
As they draw near, the enemy-commander, without breaking his
array, flings his foot-soldiers to the front and socomeson. Kaki
comes up with a troop from ‘Askari’s force and gets to grips on
his side ; the Sultans get to grips on theirs ; they get the upper
hand, unhorse man after man, and make the enemy scurry off.
Kukrs men bring down a Pagan of repute named Basant Rad
and cut off his head; 10 or 15 of his people fall on Kiki’s, and
are instantly cut to pieces. Tikhta-bigha SI. gallops along the
enemy’s front and gets his sword well in. Mughil ‘Abdu'l-

with the support of a bundle of reeds, perhaps on rafts made of such bundles (cf.

wahhab and his younger brother gets theirs in well too. Mughal
though he did not know how to swim, had crossed the river
holding to his horse’s mane.

I sent for my own boats which were behind ;* the Farmaish
coming up first, I went over in it to visit the Bengalis’ encamping-
grounds. I then went into the Gunjaish. “Is there a crossing-
place higher up?” I asked. Mir Muhammad the raftsman
represented that the Sari was better to cross higher up ;?
accordingly the army-folk 3 were ordered to cross at the higher
place he named.

While those led by Muhammad SI]. Mirza were crossing the
river,‘ the boat in which Yakka Khwaja was, sank and he went
to God’s mercy. His retainers and lands were bestowed on his
younger brother Qasim Khwaja.

The Sultans arrived while I was making ablution for the Mid-
day Prayer; I praised and thanked them and led them to expect
guerdon and kindness. ‘Askari also came; this was the first
affair he had seen ; one well-omened for him !

As the camp had not yet crossed the river, I took my rest in
the boat Gunjaish, near an island.

(ccc. Various incidents of the days following the battle.)

(May 6th) During the day of Friday (Sha‘ban 27th) we landed
at a village named Kiindih 5 in the Nirhun pargana of Kharid on
the north side of the Sarii.°

(May 8th) On Sunday (29th) Kiki was sent to Hajipir for
news.

? If the Ghogra flowed at this point in a narrow channel, it would be the swifter,
and less easy to cross than where in an open bed.

3 chirik-aili, a frequent compound, but one of which the use is better defined in the
latter than the earlier part of Babur’s writings to represent what then answered to an
Army Service Corps. This corps now crosses into Saran and joins the fighting force.

4 This appears to refer to the crossing effected before the fight.

_ 5 or Kiindbah. I have not succeeded in finding this name in the Nirhun fargana ;
it may have been at the southern end, near the ‘‘Domaigarh” of maps. In it was
Tir-mihani, perhaps a village (f. 377, f. 381).

® This passage justifies Erskine’s surmise (Afemozrs, p. 411, n. 4) that the Kharid-
country lay on both banks of the Ghogra. His further surmise that, on the east bank
of the Ghogra, it extended to the Ganges would be correct also, since the Ganges
flowed, in Babur’s day, through the Burh-ganga (Old Ganges) channel along the

southern edge of the present Kharid, and thus joined the Ghogra higher than it
now does.

Shah Muhammad (son) of Ma‘rif to whom in last year’s
campaign (934 AH.) I had shown great favour and had given the
Saran-country, had done well on several occasions, twice fighting
and overcoming his father Ma‘rif.t At the time when SI.
Mahmiid Zid perfidiously took possession of Bihar and was
opposed by Shaikh Bayazid and Biban, Shah Muhammad had
no help for it, he had to join them ; but even then, when people
were saying wild words about him, he had written dutifully
to me. When ‘Askari crossed at the Haldi-passage, Shah
Muhammad had come at once with a troop, seen him and with
him gone against the Bengalis. He now came to this ground
and waited on me.

During these days news came repeatedly that Biban and
Shaikh Bayazid were meaning to cross the Sari-river.

In these days of respite came the surprising news from Sanbal
(Sambhal) where ‘Ali-i-yisuf had stayed in order to bring the
place into some sort of order, that he and a physician who was
by way of being a friend of his, had gone to God’s mercy on
one and thesame day. ‘Abdu'l-lah (4c¢abdar) was ordered to go
and maintain order in Sanbal.

(May 13th) On Friday the 5th of the month Ramzan, ‘Abdu’l-
lah was given leave for Sanbal.?

(ddd. News from the westward.)

In these same days came a dutiful letter from Chin-timir Sl.
saying that on account of the journey of the family from Kabul,
several of the begs who had been appointed to reinforce him, had
not been able to join him ;3 also that he had gone out with
Muhammadi and other begs and braves, not less than 1oohurohs

* Bayazid and Ma‘rif Farmali were brothers. Bayazid had taken service with
Babur in 932 Au. (1526 ap.), left him in 934 AH. (end of 1527 aD.) and opposed him
near Qanij. Ma ‘rif, long a rebel against Ibrahim Laaz, had never joined Babur;
two of his sons did so; of the two, Muhammad and Misa, the latter may be the one
mentioned as at Qanij, ‘‘Ma‘rif’s son” (f. 336).—For an interesting sketch of
Marif’s character and for the location in Hindiistan of the Farmiili clan, see the
Wagt‘at-t-mushtagi, E. & D.’s History of India, iv, 584.—In connection with Qaniij,
the discursive remark may be allowable, that Babur’s halt during the construction of
the bridge of boats across the Ganges in 934 AH. is still commemorated by the name
Badshah-nagar of a village between Bangarmau and Nanamau (Elliot’s Ozaz, p. 45).

? On f. 381 ‘Abdu’l-lah’s starting-place is mentioned as Tir-mihani.

3 The failure to join would be one of the evils predicted by the dilatory start of the
ladies from Kabul (f. 3604).

Orders were sent through ‘Abdu’l-lah (Az¢abdar) for the Sultan
that he and SI. Muhammad Dé/daz, Muhammadi, and some of
the begs and braves of that country-side should assemble in
Agra and there remain ready to move to wherever an enemy
appeared.

(ece. Settlement with the Nihani Afghans.)

(May 16th) On Monday the 8th of the month, Darya Khan’s
grandson Jalal Khan to whom Shaikh Jamali had gone, came
in with his chief amirs and waited on me.?, Yahya V#hanz also
came, who had already sent his younger brother in sign of
submission and had received a royal letter accepting his service.
Not to make vain the hope with which some 7 or 8,000 Nithanz
Afghans had come in to me, I bestowed 50/aks from Bihar on
Mahmid Khan ViAani, after reserving one krir for Government
uses (Khalsa), and gave the remainder of the Bihar revenues in
trust for the above-mentioned Jalal Khan who for his part agreed
to pay one &rar of tribute. Mulla Ghulam yasdwalwas sent to
collect this tribute3 Muhammad-i-zaman Mirza received the

(May 19th) On the eve of Thursday (zr¢h) that retainer of

of the Shah-zada of Mungir named Abi’l-fath,5 had gone earlier

and gone off, some had come in submissive and accepting my

(May 21st) On Saturday (73¢/) Isma‘il Ja/wani, ‘Alail Khan
Niuhani, Auliya Khan Ashragi() and 5 and 6 amirs came in

Today guerdon was bestowed on Aisan-timir Sl. and Takhta-
bigha Sl., of swords and daggers with belts, cuirasses, dresses
of honour, and ¢ipiichag horses; also they were made to kneel,
Aisan-timir Sl. for the grant of 36 /aks from the Narniil pargana,
Tikhta-bugha Sl. for 30/aks from that of Shamsabad.

(hhh. Pursuit of Bayazid and Biban.)

(May 23rd) On Monday the 15th of the month (Ramzan), we
marched from our ground belonging to Kiindbah (or Kiindih) on
the Sari-river, with easy mind about Bihar and Bengal, and
resolute to crush the traitors Biban and Shaikh Bayazid.

(May 25th) On Wednesday (77¢h) after making two night-
halts by the way, we dismounted at a passage across the Sari,
called Chaupara-Chaturmik of Sikandarpirt From today
people were busy in crossing the river.

As news began to come again and again that the traitors,
after crossing Sarii and Gogar,? were going toward Lukni,3 the

* Chaupara is at the Saran end of the ferry, at the Sikandarpiir one is Chatur-miik
(Four-faces, an epithet of Brahma and Vishnu).

? It may be inferred from the earlier use of the phrase Gogar (or Gagar) and Sarii
(Siri or Sird), on f. 338-84, that whereas the rebels were, earlier, for crossing Sarii only,
z.e. the Ghogra below its confluence with the Sarda, they had now changed for crossing
above the confluence and further north. Such a change is explicable by desire to avoid
encounter with Babur’s following, here perhaps the army of Aid, and the same desire
is manifested by their abandonment of a fort captured (f. 3774) some days before the
rumour reached Babur of their crossing Sari and Gogar.—Since translating the passage
on f. 338, I have been led, by enforced attention to the movement of the confluence of
Ghogra with Ganges (Sari with Gang) to see that that translation, eased in obedience
to distances shewn in maps, may be wrong and that Babur’s statement that he dis-
mounted 2-3 4urohs (4~6m.) above Aid at the confluence of Gogar with Sari, may
have some geographical interest and indicate movement of the two affluents such ¢.g.
as is indicated of the Ganges and Ghogra by tradition and by the name Burh-ganga
(cf. f. 370, p. 667, n. 2).

That same night when 1 watch (fas), 5 garis had passed (ar.
10.55p.m.) and the ¢ardwih-prayers were over,3 such a storm
burst, in the inside of a moment, from the up-piled clouds of
the Rainy-season, and such a stiff gale rose, that few tents were
left standing. I was inthe Audience-tent, about to write (Aztabat
gila dir aidim) ; before I could collect papers and sections,* the
tent came down, with its porch, right on my head. The ¢anghig
went to pieces5 God preserved me! no harm befell me!
Sections and book® were drenched under water and gathered
together with much difficulty. We laid them in the folds of
a woollen throne-carpet,7 put this on the throne and on it piled
blankets. The storm quieted down in about 2 garis (45m.); the

between L:knii and L:knir makes the movements of the rebels difficult to follow.

‘That news of the rebel-crossing of the rivers did not reach Babur before the 18th and
news of their capture of L:kni or L:knir before the 19th may indicate that they had
crossed a good deal to the north of the confluence, and that the fort taken was one more

e.g. the conclusion of the Farghana section, and the diary one of 934 AH., if they lay
partly under water. The accident would be better realized in its disastrous results to
the writings, if one knew whether Babur wrote in a bound or unbound volume. From

Sarwar cleared of the Jalwani (?) rebel Biban and the Farmili opponents Bayazid and

Babur’s Kabul district of Farmil.—The Wag?‘at-2-mushtagi (E. & D.’s H. of 7. iv,
548) details the position of the clan under Sikandar Ludi.

* The MSS. write Fathpir but Nathpir suits the context, a argaxa mentioned in
the Ayin-t-akbari and now in the ‘Azamgarh district. There seems to be no Fathpiir
within Babur’s limit of distance. The D.G. of ‘Azamgarh mentions two now insigni-
ficant Fathpiirs, one as having a school, the other a market. The name G:l:r:h
(K:1:r:h) I have not found.

? The passage contained in this section seems to be a survival of the lost record of F
934 AH. (f. 339). I have found it only in the Afemozrs p. 420, and in Mr. Erskine’s
own Codex of the Wag?‘at-2-baburi (now B.M. Add. 26,200), f. 371 where however
several circumstances isolate it from the context. It may be a Persian translation of
an authentic Turki fragment, found, perhaps with other such fragments, in the Royal
Library. Its wording disassociates it from the ‘Abdu’r-rahim text. The Codex
(No. 26,200) breaks offat the foot of a page (sepra, Fathpir) with a completed sentence.
The supposedly-misplaced passage is entered on the next folio as a sort of ending of
the Babur-nama writings; in a rough script, inferior to that of the Codex, and is
followed by Zam, tam (Finis), and an incomplete date 98-, in words. Beneath this
a line is drawn, on which is subtended the triangle frequent with scribes; within
this is what seems to bea completion of the date to 980 All. and a pious wish, scrawled
in an even rougher hand than the rest.—Not only in diction and in script but in
contents also the passage is a misfit where it now stands ; it can hardly describe a
village on the Sari ; Babur in 935 AH. did not march for Ghazipiir but may have done
so in 934 AH. (p.656, n. 3); Isma‘il_/a/zvani had had leave given already in 935 AH.
(f. 377) under other conditions, ones bespeaking more trust and tried allegiance.—
Possibly the place described as having fine buildings, gardens ec. is Aad (Ajodhya)
where Babur spent some days in 934 Au. (cf. f. 3630, p. 655n. 3).

additional fragments are given from Mr. Metcalfe’s manuscript alone” (now B.M.
Add. 26,202) ‘‘and unluckily, it is extremely incorrect” (Erskine). This note will have
been written perhaps a decade before 1826, in which year the A/emozrs of Babur was
published, after long delay. Mr. Erskine’s own Codex (No. 26,200) was made good
at a later date, perhaps when he was working on his History of India (pub. 1854), by
a well-written supplement which carries the diary to its usual end s.a. 936 AH. and
also gives Persian translations of Babur’s letters to Humayiin and Khwaja Kalan.

(Ul. The westward march resumed.)

(May 31st) Those who marched early (Tuesday, Ramzan 23rd),
having lost their way, went to the great lake of Fathpir (?).
People were sent galloping off to fetch back such as were near
and Kichik Khwaja was ordered to spend the night on the lake-
shore and to bring the rest on next morning to join the camp.
We marched at dawn ; I got into the Asdaish half-way and had
it towed to our ground higher up.

(mmm. Details of the capture of a fort by Biban and Bayasid.)

On the way up, Khalifa brought Shah Muhammad diwana's
son who had come from Baqi bringing this reliable news about
Luknir ? :—They (ze. Biban and Bayazid) hurled their assault
on Saturday the 13th of the month Ramzan (Jfay 2zst) but
could do nothing by fighting ; while the fighting was going on,
a collection of wood-chips, hay, and thorns in the fort took fire,
so that inside the walls it became as hot as an oven (¢anirdik
tafsan) ; the garrison could not move round the rampart ; the
fort was lost. When the enemy heard, two or three days later,
of our return (westwards), he fled towards Dalmau.3

Today after doing as much as 10kurohs (20m.), we dismounted
beside a village called Jalisir,t on the Sarii-bank, in the Sagri
pargana.

( June 1st) We stayed on the same ground through Wednesday
(24¢h), in order to rest our cattle.

(znn. Dispositions against Biban and Bayaszia.)

Some said they had heard that Biban and Bayazid had crossed
Gang, and thought of withdrawing themselves to their kinsfolk

* Here, as earlier, Nathpiir suits the context better than Fathpir. In the Nathpir
fargana, at a distance from Chaupara approximately suiting Babur’s statement of
distance, is the lake ‘‘ Tal Ratoi”, formerly larger and deeper than now. There is
a second further west and now larger than Tal Ratoi; through this the Ghogra once
flowed, and through it has tried within the last half-century to break back. These
changes in Tal Ratoi and in the course of the Ghogra dictate caution in attempting to
locate places which were on it in Babur’s day e.g. Ksl:irth (szpra).

moned for a consultation and it was settled that Muhammad-
i-zaman Mirza and SI. Junaid Barlas who in place of Jinpir
had been given Chunar with several parganas, Mahmud Khan
Nihani, Qazi Jia, and Taj Khan Sarang-khani should block the
enemy’s road at Chunar.”

( June 2nd) Marching early in the morning of Thursday (25¢h),
we left the Sari-river, did 114uvohs (22m.), crossed the Parsart

(Sarjii) and dismounted on its bank.
Here the begs were summoned, discussion was had, and the

leaders named below were appointed to go detached from the
army, in rapid pursuit of Biban and Bayazid towards Dalmit
(Dalmau) :—Aisan-timir Sl, Muhammad SIL. M., Tukhta-bugha
S1., Qasim-i-husain S1., Bi-khib (Ni-khib) SI., Muzaffar-i-husain

‘Askari’s retainer Kichik Khwaja, and, of Hind amirs, “Alam —
Khan of Kalpi, Malik-dad Kararani, and Rao (Rawii) Sarwanz. q
(000. The march continued.)

When I went at night to make ablution in the Parsarii, people
were catching a mass of fish that had gathered round a lamp on
the surface of the water. I like others took fish in my hands.3

* Hai. MS. J: nara khand tawabi si bila (perhaps ¢aw4adi‘st but not so written).
The obscurity of these words is indicated by their variation in the manuscripts. Most
scribes have them as Chunar and Jiinpiir, guided presumably by the despatch of a force
to Chunar on receipt of the news, but another force was sent to Dalmau at the same
time. The rebels were defeated s.w. of Dalmau and thence went to Mahia ; it is
not certain that they had crossed the Ganges at Dalmau ; there are difficulties in
supposing the fort they captured and_abandoned was Lakhnau (Oude) ; they might
have gone south to near Kalpi and Adampir, which are at no great distance from
where they were defeated by Baqi shaghawal, if Lakhnir (now Shahabad in Rampiir)
were the fort. (Cf. Appendix T.)—To take up the interpretation of the words
quoted above, at another point, that of the kinsfolk or fellow-Afghans the rebels
planned to join :—these kinsfolk may have been, of Bayazid, the Farmilis in Sarwar,
and of Biban, the Jalwanis of the same place. The two may have trusted to
relationship for harbourage during the Rains, disloyal though they were to their
kinsmen’s accepted suzerain. Therefore if they were once across Ganges and Jumna,
as they were in Mahiiba, they may have thought of working eastwards south of the
Ganges and of getting north into Sarwar through territory belonging to the Chunar and
Jinpir governments. This however is not expressed by the words quoted above;
perhaps Babur’s record was hastily and incompletely written.—Another reading may
be Chunar and Jaund (in Akbar’s sarhar of Rohtas).

° yilini tiishgdilar. It may be observed concerning the despatch of Muhammad-
i-zaman M. and of Junaid Bar/as that they went to their new appointments Jiinpir
and Chunar respectively ; that their doing so was an orderly part of the winding-up of
Babur’s Eastern operations; that they remained as part of the Eastern garrison, on
duty apart from that of blocking the road of Biban and Bayazid.

3 This mode of fishing is still practised in India (Erskine).

(June 3rd) On Friday (26th) we dismounted on a very slender
stream, the head-water of a branch of the Parsari. In order
not to be disturbed by the comings and goings of the army-folk,
I had it dammed higher up and had a place, 10 by 10, made for
ablution. The night of the 27th‘ was spent on this ground.

(June 4th) At the dawn of the same day (Saturday 27th) we
left that water, crossed the Tiis and dismounted on its bank.”

(June 5th) On Sunday (28th) we dismounted on the bank of
the same water.

(June 6th) On Monday the 29th of the month (Ramzan), our
station was on the bank of the same Tiis-water. Though tonight
the sky was not quite clear,.a few people saw the Moon, and so
testifying to the Qazi, fixed the end of the month (Ramzax).

( June 7th) On Tuesday (Shawwél rst) we made the Prayer
of the Festival, at dawn rode on, did 10kuvohs (20m.), and dis-
mounted on the bank of the Gui (Gimti), a kuroh (2m.) from
Maing.3 The sin of maYiin was committed (zrtzkab qilildi) near
the Mid-day Prayer; I had sent this little couplet of invitation
to Shaikh Zain, Mulla Shihab and Khwand-amir :—

his leave.

(June 9th) Next day (Thursday 3rd) we did 11 kurohs (22m.),
crossed the Gii-water (Giimti), and dismounted on its bank.

(ppp. Concerning the pursuit of Biban and Bayazid.)

News came in about the sultans and begs of the advance that
they had reached Dalmiid (Dalmau), but were said not yet to
have crossed the water (Ganges). Angered by this (delay), I sent
orders, “ Cross the water at once; follow the track of the rebels;
cross Jiin (Jumna) also; join ‘Alam Khan to yourselves; be
energetic and get to grips with the adversary.”

(999. The march continued.)

(June roth) After leaving this water (Gamitz, Friday 4th) we
made two night-halts and reached Dalmiid (Dalmau), where
most of the army-folk crossed Gang, there and then, by a ford.
While the camp was being got over, main was eaten on an
island (aval) below the ford.

(June 13th) After crossing, we waited one day (Afonday 7th)
for all the army-folk to get across. Today Baqi Tashkindi came
in with the army of Aid (Ajodhya) and waited on me.

( June 14th) Leaving the Gang-water(Ganges, Tuesday 8th), we
made one night-halt, then dismounted (/une 15th-Shawwal 9th)
beside Kiirarah (Kira Khas) on the Arind-water. The distance
from Dalmiid (Dalmau) to Kirarah came out at 22 hurohs
(44m.).?

(June 16th) On Thursday (10¢h) we marched early from that
ground and dismounted opposite the Adampir pargana3

To enable us to cross (Jin) in pursuit of our adversaries, a few
raftsmen had been sent forward to collect at Kalpi what boats
were to be had ; some boats arrived the night we dismounted,
moreover a ford was found through the Jin-river.

ground.
(rrr. Concerning Biban and Bayazid.)

Not getting reliable news about the enemy, we sent Baqi
shaghawal with a few braves of the interior * to get information
about him.

(June 17th) Next day (Friday rth) at the Other Prayer,
one of Baqi Beg’s retainers came in. Baqi had beaten scouts of
Biban and Bayazid, killed one of their good men, Mubarak Khan
Jatwani,and some others, sentin several heads,and one man alive.

( June 18th) At dawn (Saturday 12th) Paymaster Shah Husain
came in, told the story of the beating of the scouts, and gave
various news.

Tonight, that is to say, the night of Sunday the 13th of the
month,? the river Jin came down in flood, so that by the dawn,
the whole of the island on which I was settled, was under water.
I moved to another an arrow’s-flight down-stream, there had a
tent set up and settled down.

( June 20th) On Monday (14th) Jalal Tashkindi came from
the begs and sultans of theadvance. Shaikh Bayazid and Biban,
on hearing of their expedition, had fled to the pargana of
Mahiba.3

As the Rains had set in and as after 5 or © months of active
service, horses and cattle in the army were worn out, the sultans
and begs of the expedition were ordered to remain where they
were till they received fresh supplies from Agra and those parts.
At the Other Prayer of the same day, leave was given to Baqi
and the army of Aid (Ajodhya). Also an allowance of 30/ahks 4
from Amroha was assigned to Misa (son) of Ma‘rif Farmiéli, who
had waited on me at the time the returning army was crossing

(sss. Babur returns to Agra.)

(June 21st) With an easy mind about these parts, we set out
for Agra, raid-fashion,t when 3fas 1gari of Tuesday night were
past.2, In the morning (Tuesday 15th) we did 16kurohs (32m.),
near mid-day made our nooning in the pargana of Baladar, one
of the dependencies of Kalpi, there gave our horses barley, at the
Evening Prayer rode on, did 13urohs (26m.) in the night, at
the 3rd night-watch (sd-night, Shawwal 15-16th) dismounted
at Bahadur Khan Sarwani’s tomb at Stgandpir, a pargana of
Kalpi, slept a little, went through the Morning Prayer and hurried
on. After doing 164urohs (32m.), we reached Etawa at the fall
of day, where Mahdi Khwaja came out to meet us3 Riding
on after the Ist night-watch (9p.m.), we slept a little on the way,
did 164urohs (32m.), took our nooning at Fathpir of Rapri, rode
on soon after the Mid-day Prayer (Thursday Shawwal 17th),
did 17kurohs (34m.), and in the 2nd night-watch4 dismounted
in the Garden-of-eight-paradises at Agra.

(June 24th) At the dawn of Friday (78th) Pay-master Sl.
Muhammad came with several more to wait on me. Towards the
Mid-day Prayer, having crossed Jin, I waited on Khwaja‘Abdu'l-
haqgq, went into the Fort and saw the begims my paternal-aunts.
(ttt. Indian-grown fruits.)

A Balkhi melon-grower had been set to raise melons ; he now
brought a few first-rate small ones ; on one or two bush-vines
(ata-tak) 1 had had planted in the Garden-of-eight-paradises
very good grapes had grown ; Shaikh Giiran sent me a basket
of grapes which too were not bad. To have grapes and melons
grown in this way in Hindistan filled my measure of content.

(uuu. Arrival of Mahim Begim.)
(June 26th) Mahim arrived while yet two watches of Sunday
night (Shawzal 20th) 5 remained. By a singular agreement

* i.e, riding light and fast. The distance done between Adampiir and Agra was
some 157 miles, the time was from 12a.m. on Tuesday morning to about 9p.m. of
Thursday. This exploit serves to show that three years of continuous activity in the
plains of Hindistan had not destroyed Babur’s capacity for sustained effort, spite of
several attacks of (malarial ?) fever.

of things they had left Kabul on the very day, the roth of the

(July 7th) On Thursday the Ist of Zi’l-qa‘da the offerings
made by Humayiin and Mahim were set out while I sat in the
large Hall of Audience.

Today also wages were given to 150 porters (Aahar) and they
were started off under a servant of Faghfur Diwan to fetch
melons, grapes, and other fruits from Kabul.

(vov. Concerning Sambhal.)

(July 9th) On Saturday the 3rd of the month, Hindi Beg
who had come as escort from Kabul and must have been sent to
Sambhal on account of the death of ‘Ali-i-yiisuf, came and waited
on me? Khalifa’s (son) Husamu’d-din came also today from
Alwar and waited on me.

(July roth) On Sunday morning (4th) came ‘Abdu’l-lah
(kitabdar), who from Tir-mihani3 had been sent to Sambhal on
account of the death of ‘Ali-i-yisuf.

(Here the record of 7 days ts wanting.)
(www. Sedition in Lahor.)

People from Kabul were saying that Shaikh Sharaf of Qara-
bagh, either incited by ‘Abdu’l-‘aziz or out of liking for him,
had written an attestation which attributed to me oppression
I had not done, and outrage that had not happened ; that he

% Mahim’s journey from Kabul to Agra had occupied over 5 months.

2 Hindi Beg gichin had been made Humayin’s retainer in 932 AH. (f. 297), and had
taken possession of Sambhal for him. Hence, as it seems, he was ordered, while
escorting the ladies from Kabul, to go to Sambhal. Heseems to have gone before
waiting on Babur, probably not coming into Agra till now.—It may be noted here
that in 933AuH. he transformed a Hindi temple into a Mosque in Sambhal ; it was
done by Babur’s orders and is commemorated by an inscription still existing on the
Mosque, one seeming not to be of his own composition, judging by its praise of himself.
(JASB. Proceedings, May 1873, p.98, Blochmann’s art. where the inscription is given
and translated ; and Archeological Survey Reports, xii, p. 24-27, with Plates showing
the Mosque).

3 Cf. f. 375, f.377, with notes concerning ‘Abdu’l-lah and Tir-mihani. I have not
found the name Tir-miithani on maps; its position can be inferred from Babur’s state-
ment (f.375) that he had sent ‘Abdu’l-lah to Sambhal, he being then at Kunba or
Kunia in the Nurhun gargana.—The name Tir-mithani occurs also in Gorakhpir.—
It was at Tir-mihani (Three-mouths) that Khwand-amir completed the Hadibi’s-
Siyar (lith. ed. i, 83; Rieu’s Pers. Cat. p. 1079). If the name imply three water-
mouths, they might be those of Ganges, Ghogra and Daha.

had extorted the signatures of the Prayer-leaders (zmamlar) of
Lahor to this accusation, and had sent copies of it to the various
towns ; that ‘Abdu’l-‘aziz himself had failed to give ear to several
royal orders, had spoken unseemly words, and done acts which
ought to have been left undone. On account of these matters
Qambar-i-‘ali Avghiin was started off on Sunday the 11th of the
month (Z#l-ga‘da), to arrest Shaikh Sharaf, the Lahor zmams
with their associates, and ‘Abdu’l-‘aziz, and to bring them all to
Court.

(xxx. Varia.)

(July 22nd) On Thursday the 15th of the month Chin-timir
Sl. came in from Tijara and waited on me. Today Champion
Sadiq and the great champion-wrestler of Atid wrestled. Sadiq
gave a half-throw*; he was much vexed.

(July 28th) On Monday the 19th of the month (27’/-ga‘da)
the Qizil-bash envoy Murad the life-guardsman was made to put
on an inlaid dagger with belt, and a befitting dress of honour,
was presented with 2/aks of tankas and given leave to go.

(Here the record of 15 days is wanting.)
(yyy. Sedition in Gialiar.)

(August 11th) Sayyid Mashhadi who had come from Gualiar
in these days, represented that Rahim-dad was stirring up
sedition.2, On account of this, Khalifa’s servant Shah Muhammad
the seal-bearer was sent to convey to Rahim-dad matters written
with commingling of good counsel. He went; and in a few
days came back bringing Rahim-dad’s son, but, though the
son came, Rahim-dad himself had no thought of coming. On
Wednesday the 5th of Z2#’/-Aija, Nir Beg was sent to Gialiar

* nim-kara. EE. and de C. however reverse the véles.

? The 7arikh-i-gualiari (B.M. Add. 16,709, p. 18) supplements the fragmentary
accounts which, above and s.a. 936AH., are all that the Babur-nadma now preserves
concerning Khwaja Rahim-dad’s misconduct. It has several mistakes but the gist of
its information is useful. It mentions that the Khwaja and his paternal-uncle Mahdi
Khwaja had displeased Babur ; that Rahim-dad resolved to take refuge with the ruler
of Malwa (Muhammad X/i/z) and to make over Giialiar toa Rajput landholder of
that country ; that upon this Shaikh Muhammad Gaus went to Agra and interceded
with Babur and obtained his forgiveness for Rahim-dad. Gwaliar was given back to
Rahim-dad but after a time he was superseded by Abi’l-fath [Shaikh Giran]. For
particulars about Mahdi Khwaja and a singular story told about him by Nizamu’d-din
Ahmad in the 7abagat-2-akbari, vide Gul-badan’s Humayin-nama, Appendix B, and
Translators Note p. 702, Section f.

to allay Rahim-dad’s fears, came back in a few days, and laid
requests from Rahim-dad before us. Orders in accordance with
those requests had been written and were on the point of despatch
when one of Rahim-dad’s servants arriving, represented that he
had come to effect the escape of the son and that Rahim-dad
himself had no thought of coming in. I was for riding out at
once to Gialiar, but Khalifa set it forth to me, “ Let me write
one more letter commingled with good counsel ; he may even yet
come peacefully.” On this mission Khusrau’s (son ?) Shihabu’d-
din was despatched.

(August 12th) On Thursday the 6th of the month mentioned
(Zi'l-hija) Mahdi Khwaja came in from Etawa.?

(August 16th) On the Festival-day? (Wonday roth) Hindi Beg
was presented with a special head-to-foot, an inlaid dagger with
belt ; also a pargana worth 7 /aks 3 was bestowed on Hasan-i-‘ali,
well-known among the Turkmans4 for a Chaghatai.5

* He may have come about the misconduct of his nephew Rahim-dad.

2 The ‘Idu’l-kabir, the Great Festival of roth Zii’l-hijja.

3 About £1750 (Erskine).

4 Perhaps he was from the tract in Persia still called Chaghatai Mountains. One
Ibrahim Chaghatai is mentioned by Babur (f. 1754) with Turkman begs who joined
Husain Bai-gara. This Hasan-i-‘ali Chaghatai may have come in like manner, with
Murad the Turkman envoy from ‘Iraq (f. 369 and n. 1).

5 Several incidents recorded by Gul-badan (writing half a century later) as following
Mahim’s arrival in Agra, will belong to the record of 935 AH. because they preceded
Humiayin’s arrival from Badakhshan. Their omission from Babur’s diary is explicable
by its minor /acune. Such are :—(1) a visit to Dhilpir and Sikri the interest of
which lies in its showing that Bibi Mubarika had accompanied Mahim Begim to Agra
from Kabul, and that there was in Sikri a quiet retreat, a chaukandi, where Babur
“used to write his book” ;—(2) the arrival of the main caravan of ladies from Kabul,
which led Babur to go four miles out, to Naugram, in order to give honouring
reception to his sister Khan-zada Begim ;—(3) an excursion to the Gold-scattering
garden (Bagh-t-zar-afshan), where seated among his own people, Babur said he was
“bowed down by ruling and reigning”, longed to retire to that garden with a single
attendant, and wished to make over his sovereignty to Humayin ;—(4) the death of
Dil-dar’s son Alwar (var. Anwar) whose birth may be assigned to the gap preceding
932AH. because not chronicled later by Babur, as is Fariiq’s. As a distraction from
the sorrow for this loss, a journey was ‘‘ pleasantly made by water” to Dhilpar.

Muhammad Ghaus* came in from Gialiar with Khusrau’s (son)
Shihabu’d-din to plead for Rahim-dad. As Shaikh Muhammad
Ghaiis was a pious and excellent person, Rahim-dad’s faults were
forgiven for his sake. Shaikh Giran and Nir Beg were sent
off for Gialiar, so that the place having been made over to their

TRANSLATOR’S NOTE ON 936 To 937 AH.—1529 to 1530 AD.

It is difficult to find material for filling the Zacuna of some
15 months, which occurs in Babur’s diary after the broken
passage of Muharram 3rd 936 AH. (Sept. 7th 1529 AD.) and down
tothe date of his death on Jumada I. 6th 937AH. (Dec. 26th
1530AD.). The known original sources are few, their historical
matter scant, their contents mainly biographical. Gleanings
may yet be made, however, in unexpected places, such gleanings
as are provided by Ahmad-i-yddgar’s interpolation of Timirid
history amongst his lives of Afghan Sultans.

The earliest original source which helps to fill the gap of
936 AH. is Haidar Mirza’s 7arikh-t-rashidi, finished as to its
Second Part which contains Babur’s biography, in 948 AH.
{1541 AD.), 12 years therefore after the year of the gap 936 AH.
It gives valuable information about the affairs of Badakhshan,
based on its author’s personal experience at 30 years of age, and
was Abi’l-fazl’s authority for the Akéar-nama.

The next in date of the original sources is Gul-badan Begim’s
Humayiin-nama, a chronicle of family affairs, which she wrote in
Obedience to her nephew Akbar’s command, given in about
995 AH. (1587 AD.), some 57 years after her Father’s death, that
whatever any person knew of his father (Humayin) and grand-
father (Babur) should be written down for Abi’l-fazl’s use. It
embodies family memories and traditions, and presumably gives
the recollections of several ladies of the royal circle.?

* Jauhar’s Humdayin-nama and Bayazid Biya?’s work of the same title were written
under the same royal command as the Begim’s. They contribute nothing towards
filling the gap of 936AH. ; their authors, being Humayin’s servants, write about him.
It may be observed that criticism of these books, as recording trivialities, is disarmed
if they were commanded because they would obey an order to set down whatever
was known, selection amongst their contents resting with Abi’l-fazl. Even more
completely must they be excluded from a verdict on the literary standard of their
day.—Abw’l-fazl must have had a source of Baburiana which has not found its way
into European libraries. A man likely to have contributed his recollections, directly or
transmitted, is Khwaja Muqim Hardwi. The date of Muqim’s death is conjectural
only, but he lived long enough to impress the worth of historical writing on his son
Nizamu’-d-din Ahmad. (Cf. E. and D.’s H. of I. art. Yabagat-1-akbari_v,177 and
187; T.-i-A. lith. ed. p.193; and for Bayazid Brya?’s work, JASB. 1898, p. 296.)

692 TRANSLATOR’S NOTE

The Akbar-nama derives much of its narrative for 936-937 AH.
from Haidar Mirza and Gul-badan Begim, but its accounts of
Babur’s self-surrender and of his dying address to his chiefs
presuppose the help of information from a contemporary witness.
It is noticeable that the Afbar-nama records no public events
as occurring in Hindiistan during 936-937 AH., nothing of the
sequel of rebellion by Rahim-dad?* and ‘Abdu’l-‘aziz, nothing of
the untiring Biban and Bayazid. That something could have
been told is shown by what Ahmad-i-yadgar has preserved (vzde
post); but 50 years had passed since Babur’s death and, manifestly,
interest in filling the /acune in his diary was then less keen than it
is over 300 years later. What in the Akéar-nama concerns Babur
is likely to have been written somewhat early in the cr. 15
years of its author’s labours on it,? but, even so, the elder women
of the royal circle had had rest after the miseries Humayiin had
wrought, the forgiveness of family affection would veil his past,
and certainly has provided Abi’l-faz] with an over-mellowed
estimate of him, one ill-assorting with what is justified by his
Babur-nama record.

The contribution made towards filling the gap of 936-937 AH.
in the body of Niz&amu-’d-din Ahmad’s Yadagat-7-akbari is
limited to a curious and doubtfully acceptable anecdote about
a plan for the supersession of Humayin as Padshah, and about
the part played by Khwaja Muqim Hardwi in its abandonment.
A further contribution is made, however, in Book VII which
contains the history of the Muhammadan Kings of Kashmir,
namely, that Babur despatched an expedition into that country.
As no such expedition is recorded or referred to in surviving
Babur-nama writings, it is likely to have been sent in 936AH.
during Babur’s tour to and from Lahor. If it were made with
the aim of extending Timirid authority in the Himalayan
borderlands, a hint of similar policy elsewhere may be given
by the ceremonious visit of the Raja of Kahlir to Babur,

* Ibn Batuta (Lee’s trs. p. 133) mentions that after his appointment to Gaaliar,
Rahim-dad fell from favour . . . but was restored later, on the representation of
Muhammad Ghaus ; held Giialiar again for a short time, (he went to Bahadur Shah
in Gujrat) and was succeeded by Abi’l-fath (z.e. Shaikh Giran) who held it till
Babur’s death.

mentioned by Ahmad-i-yadgar (vede post).* The T.-i-A. was
written within the term of Abi’l-fazl’s work on the Akédar-nama,
being begun later, and ended about 9 years earlier, in 1002 AH.—
1593AD. It appears to have been Abi’-!-fazl’s authority for his
account of the campaign carried on in Kashmir by Babur’s
chiefs (Ayin-2-akbari vol. ii, part i, Jarrett’s trs. p. 389).

An important contribution, seeming to be authentic, is found
interpolated in Ahmad-i-yadgar’s Tavikh-c-salatin-t-afaghana,
one which outlines a journey made by Babur to Lahor in 936 AH.
and gives circumstantial details of a punitive expedition sent by
him from Sihrind at the complaint of the Qazi of Samana against
a certain Mundahir Rajpit. The whole contribution dovetails
into matters found elsewhere. Its precision of detail bespeaks
a closely-contemporary written source.? As its fullest passage
concerns the Samana Qazi’s affair, its basis of record may have
been found in Samana. Some considerations about the date of
Ahmad-i-yadgar’s own book and what Niamatu’l-lah says of
Haibat Khan of Samana, his own generous helper in the 7a@rikh-
t-Khan-t-jahan Lidi, point towards Haibat Khan as providing
the details of the Qazi’s wrongs and avenging. The indication
is strengthened by the circumstance that what precedes and what
follows the account of the punitive expedition is outlined only.3
Ahmad-i-yadgar interpolates an account of Humayin also, which
is a frank plagiarism from the Yabagat-i-akbari. He tells too
a story purporting to explain why Babur “selected” Humayiin to
succeed him, one parallel with Nizamu’d-din Ahmad’s about
what led Khalifa to abandon his plan of setting the Mirza aside.
Its sole value lies in its testimony to a belief, held by its first
narrator whoever he was, that choice was exercised in the matter
by Babur. Reasons for thinking Nizaimu’d-din’s story, as it
stands, highly improbable, will be found later in this note.

* I am indebted to my husband for acquaintance with Nizamu’-d-din Ahmad’s
record about Babur and Kashmir.

? In view of the vicissitudes to which under Humayiin the royal library was
subjected, it would be difficult to assert that this source was not the missing con-
tinuation of Babur’s diary.

694 TRANSLATOR’S NOTE

Muhammad Qasim Hindi Shah Firishta’s Tarikh-t-firishta
contains an interesting account of Babur but contributes towards
filling the gap in the events of 936-937 AH. little that is not in the
earlier sources. In M. Jules Mohl’s opinion it was under revision
as late as 1623 AD. (1032-3 AH.).

a. Humayiin and Badakhshan.

An occurrence which had important results, was the arrival
of Humayiin in Agra, unsummoned by his Father, from the
outpost station of Badakhshan. It will have occurred early in
936 AH. (autumn 1529 AD.), because he was in Kabul in the first
ten days of the last month of 935 AH. (wide fost). Curiously
enough his half-sister Gul-badan does not mention his coming,
whether through avoidance of the topic or from inadvertence; the
omission may be due however to the loss ofa folio from the only
known MS. of her book (that now owned by the British Museum),
and this is the more likely that Abi’l-fazl writes, at some length,
about the arrival and its motive, what the Begim might have
provided, this especially by his attribution of filial affection as
Humayin’s reason for coming to Agra.

Haidar Mirza is the authority for the Akbar-nama account of
Humayin’s departure from Qila‘-i-zafar and its political and
military sequel. He explains the departure by saying that when
Babur had subdued Hindistan, his sons Humayiin and Kamran
were grown-up ; and that wishing to have one of them at hand in
case of his own death, he summoned Humayin, leaving Kamran
in Qandahar. No doubt these were the contemporary impressions
conveyed to Haidar, and strengthened by the accomplished fact
before he wrote some 12 years later ; nevertheless there are two
clear indications that there was no royal order for Humayin to
leave Qila‘-i-zafar, vzz. that no-one had been appointed to relieve
him even when he reached Agra, and that Abi’l-fazl mentions
no summons but attributes the Mirza’s departure from his post
to an overwhelming desire to see his Father. What appears ©
probable is that Mahim wrote to her son urging his coming to
Agra, and that this was represented as Babur’s wish. However
little weight may be due to the rumour, preserved in anecdotes
recorded long after 935 AH., that any-one, Babur or Khalifa,



--- Page 261 ---
936 To 937 AH.--1529 To 1530 AD. 695

inclined against Humayiin’s succession, that rumour she would
set herself to falsify by reconciliation.”

When the Mirza’s intention to leave Qila‘-i-zafar became
known there, the chiefs represented that they should not be able
to withstand the Aizbeg on their frontier without him (his troops
implied).? With this he agreed, said that still he must go, and
that he would send a Mirza in his place as soon as possible. He
then rode, in one day, to Kabul, an item of rapid travel preserved
by Abii’l-fazl.

Humayin’s departure caused such anxiety in Qila‘-i-zafar that
some (if not all) of the Badakhshi chiefs hurried off an invitation
to Said Khan Chaghatdi, the then ruler in Kashghar in whose
service Haidar Mirza was, to come at once and occupy the fort.
They said that Faqir-i-‘ali who had been left in charge, was not
strong enough to cope with the Aiizbeg, begged Sa‘id to come,
and strengthened their petition by reminding him of his
hereditary right to Badakhshan, derived from Shah Begim
Badakhshi. Their urgency convincing the Khan that risk
threatened the country, he started from Kashghar in Muharram
936 AH. (Sept.—Oct. 1529 AD.). On reaching Sdarigh-chiipan
which by the annexation of Aba-bakr Mirza Dighlat was now
his own most western territory 3 but which formerly was one of
the upper districts of Badakhshan, he waited while Haidar went
on towards Qila‘-i-zafar only to learn on his road, that Hind-al
(@z.10) had been sent from Kabul by Humayin and had
entered the fort 12 days before.

The Kashgharis were thus placed in the difficulty that the fort
was occupied by Babur’s representative, and that the snows would
prevent their return home across the mountains till winter was
past. Winter-quarters were needed and asked for by Haidar,
certain districts being specified in which to await the re-opening
of the Pamir routes. He failed in his request, “They did not
trust us,” he writes, “indeed suspected us of deceit.” His own
account of Sa‘id’s earlier invasion of Badakhshan (925 AH.—
1519 AD.) during Khan Mirza’s rule, serves to explain Badakhshi

* Humayiin’s last recorded act in Hindistdn was that of 933 AH. (f. 3296) when he
took unauthorized possession of treasure in Dihli.

distrust of Kashgharis. Failing in his negotiations, he scoured
and pillaged the country round the fort, and when a few days
later the Khan arrived, his men took what Haidar’s had left.
Said Khan is recorded to have besieged the fort for three
months, but nothing serious seems to have been attempted since
no mention of fighting is made, none of assault or sally, and
towards the end of the winter he was waited on by those who
had invited his presence, with apology for not having admitted
him into the fort, which they said they would have done but for
the arrival of Hind-al Mirza. To this the Khan replied that for
him to oppose Babur Padshah was impossible; he reminded the
chiefs that he was there by request, that it would be as hurtful for
the Padshah as for himself to have the Aiizbeg in Badakhshan
and, finally, he gave it as his opinion that, as matters stood, every
man should go home. His view of the general duty may include
that of Badakhshi auxiliaries such as Sultan Wais of Kil-ab
who had reinforced the garrison. So saying, he himself set out
for Kashghar, and at the beginning of Spring reached Yarkand.

6. Humiayin’s further action.

Humayiin will have reached Kabul before Zii’l-hijja 1oth
935 AH. (Aug. 26th 1529 AD.) because it is on record that he met
Kamran on the Kabul ‘Id-gah, and both will have been there to
keep the ‘Idu’l-kabir, the Great Festival of Gifts, which is held on
that day. Kamran had come from Qandahar, whether to keep the
Feast, or because he had heard of Humiayin’s intended movement
from Badakhshan, or because changes were foreseen and he
coveted Kabul, as the Babur-nama and later records allow to be
inferred. He asked Humayin, says Abi’l-fazl, why he was there
and was told of his brother’s impending journey to Agra under
overwhelming desire to see their Father.2 Presumably the two
Mirzas discussed the position in which Badakhshan had been
left; in the end Hind-al was sent to Qila‘-i-zafar, notwithstanding
that he was under orders for Hindustan.

Humayiin may have stayed some weeks in Kabul, how many
those familiar with the seasons and the routes between Yarkand

,' Abii'l-fazl’s record of Humiyin’s sayings and minor doings at this early date in
his career, can hardly be anything more accurate than family-tradition.

and Qila‘-i-zafar, might be able to surmise if the date of Hind-al’s
start northward for which Humayin is likely to have waited,
were found by dovetailing the Muharram of Sa‘td’s start, the
approximate length of his journey toSarigh-chiipan, and Haidar’s
reception of news that Hind-al had been 12 days in the fort.

Humiayiin’s arrival in Agra is said by Abi’l-fazl to have been
cheering to the royal family in their sadness for the death of
Alwar (end of 935 AH.) and to have given pleasure to his Father.
But the time is all too near the date of Babur’s letter (f.348)
to Humayin, that of a dissatisfied parent, to allow the supposition
that his desertion of his post would fail to displease.

That it was a desertion and not an act of obedience seems
clear from the circumstance that the post had yet to be filled.
Khalifa is said to have been asked to take it and to have
refused ;* Humayiin to have been sounded as to return and to
have expressed unwillingness. Babur then did what was an
honourable sequel to his acceptance in 926 AH. of the charge of
the fatherless child Sulaiman, by sending him, now about 16, to
take charge where his father Khan Mirza had ruled, and by still
keeping him under his own protection.

Sulaiman’s start from Agra will not have been delayed, and
(accepting Ahmad-i-yadgar’s record,) Babur himself will have
gone as far as Lahor either with him or shortly after him, an
expedition supporting Sulaiman, and menacing Sa‘id in his
winter leaguer round Qila‘-i-zafar. Meantime Humdayiin was
ordered to his fief of Sambhal.

After Sulaiman’s appointment Babur wrote to Sa‘id a fee
of which Haidar gives the gist :—It expresses surprise at Sa‘id’s
doings in Badakhshan, says that Hind-al has been recalled and
Sulaiman sent, that if Sa‘id regard hereditary right, he will

* The statement that Khalifa was asked to go so far from where he was of the first
importance as an administrator, leads to consideration of why it was done. So little
is known explicitly of Babur’s intentions about his territories after his death that it is
possible only to put that little together and read between itslines. It may be that he
was now planning an immediate retirement to Kabul and an apportionment during life
of his dominions, such as Abii-sa‘id had made of his own. Ifso, it would be desirable
to have Badakhshan held in strength such as Khalifa’s family could command, and
especially desirable because as Barlas Turks, that family would be one with Babur
in desire to regain Transoxiana. Such a political motive would worthily explain the
offer of the appointment.

leave “Sulaiman Shah Mirza”? in possession, who is as a son to
them both,? that this would be well, that otherwise he (Babur) :
will make over responsibility to the heir (Sulaiman) ;3 and, “The

rest you know.” 4

c. Babur visits Lahor.

If Ahmad-i-yadgar’s account of a journey made by Babur to
Lahor and the Panj-ab be accepted, the /acuna of 936 AH. is —
appropriately filled. He places the expedition in the 3rd year of —
Babur’s rule in Hindustan, which, counting from the first reading
of the £hutba for Babur in Dihli (f. 286), began on Rajab 15th
935 AH. (March 26th 1529 AD.). But as Babur’s diary-record for
935 AH. is complete down to end of the year, (minor /acune
excepted), the time of his leaving Agra for Lahor is relegated to
936 AH. He must have left early in the year, (1) to allow time,
before the occurrence of the known events preceding his own
death, for the long expedition Ahmad-i-yadgar calls one of
a year, and (2) because an early start after Humayiin’s arrival
and Sulaiman’s departure would suit the position of affairs and
the dates mentioned or implied by Haidar’s and by Ahmad-i-
yadgar’s narratives.

Two reasons of policy are discernible, in the known events of
the time, to recommend a journey in force towards the North-west ;
first, the sedition of ‘Abdu’l-‘aziz in Lahor (f. 381), and secondly,
the invasion of Badakhshan by Sa‘id Khan with its resulting
need of supporting Sulaiman by a menace of armed intervention.5

* The ‘‘Shah” of this style is derived from Sulaiman’s Badakhshi descent through
Shah Begim; the ‘‘ Mirza” from his Miran-shahi descent through his father Wais
Khan Mirza. The title Khin Mirza or Mirza Khan, presumably according to the
outlook of the speaker, was similarly derived from forbears, as would be also Shah
Begim’s ; (her personal name is not mentioned in the sources).

? Sa‘id, on the father’s, and Babur, on the mother’s side, were of the same
generation in descent from Yiinas Khan ; Sulaiman was ofa younger one, hence his
pseudo-filial relation to the men of the elder one.

3 Sa‘id was Shah Begim’s grandson through her son’Ahmad, Sulaiman her great-
grandson through her daughter Sultan-Nigar, but Sulaiman could claim also as the
heir of his father who was nominated to rule by Shah Begim ; moreover, he could
claim by right of conquest on the father’s side, through Abi-sa‘id the conqueror, his
son Mahmid long the ruler, and so through Mahmiid’s son Wais Khan Mirza.

4 The menace conveyed by these words would be made the more forceful by Babur’s
move to Lahor, narrated by Ahmad-i-yadgar. Some ill-result to Sa ‘id of independent
rule by Sulaiman seems foreshadowed ; was it that if Babur’s restraining hand were
withdrawn, the Badakhshis would try to regain their lost districts and would have help
in so-doing from Babur ? ’

5 It is open to conjecture that if affairs in Hindistan had allowed it, Babur would
now have returned to Kabul. Ahmad-i-yadgar makes the expedition to be one for



--- Page 265 ---
936 To 937 AH.—1529 10 1530 AD. 699

In Sihrind the Raja of Kahlir, a place which may be one of the
Simla hill-states, waited on Babur, made offering of 7 falcons and
3 mans* of gold, and was confirmed in his fief.?

In Lahor Kamran is said to have received his Father, in
a garden of his own creation, and to have introduced the local
chiefs as though he were the Governor of Lahor some writers
describe him as then being. The best sources, however, leave
him still posted in Qandahar. He had been appointed to
Multan (f.359) when ‘Askari was summoned to Agra (f. 339),
but whether he actually went there is not assured; some months
later (Zi'l-hijja 10th 935 AH.) he is described by Abi’l-fazl as
coming to Kabul from Qandahar. He took both Multan3 and
Lahor by force from his (half-)brother Humayiin in 935 AH.
(1531 AD.) the year after their Father's death. That he should
wait upon his Father in Lahor would be natural, Hind-al did so,
coming from Kabul. Hind-al will have come to Lahor after
making over charge of Qila‘-i-zafar to Sulaiman,and he went back
at the end of the cold season, going perhaps just before his Father
started from Lahor on his return journey, the gifts he received
before leaving being 2 elephants, 4 horses, belts and jewelled
daggers.+

Babur is said to have left Lahor on Rajab 4th (936 AH.)—
March 4th, 1530AD.). From Ahmad-i-yadgar’s outline of Babur’s
doings in Lahor, he, or his original, must be taken as ill-informed

pleasure only, and describes Babur as hunting and sight-seeing for a year in Lahor,
the Panj-ab and near Dihli. This appears a mere flourish of words, in view of the
purposes the expedition served, and of the difficulties which had arisen in Lahor itself
and with Sa‘id Khan. Part of the work effected may have been the despatch of an
expedition to Kashmir.

* This appears a large amount.

2 The precision with which the Raja’s gifts are stated, points to a closely-con-
temporary and written source. A second such indication occurs later where gifts
made to Hind-al are mentioned.

3 An account of the events in Multan after its occupation by Shah Hasan Arghiin
is found in the latter part of the Zasagat-¢-akbari and in Erskine’s H. of I. i, 393 e¢
seg.—It may be noted here that several instances of confusion amongst Babur’s sons
Occur in the extracts made by Sir EH. Elliot and Professor Dowson in their “story
of India from the less authoritative sources [e.g. v, 35 Kamran for Humayin, ‘Askari
said to be in Kabul (pp. 36 and 37) ; Hind-al for Humayiin e¢c.] and that these errors
have slipped into several of the District Gazetteers of the United Provinces.

4 As was said of the offering made by the Raja of Kahlir, the precision of statement
as to what was given to Hind-al, bespeaks a closely-contemporary written source.
So too does the mention (text, 2/ra) of the dey on which Babur began his return
journey from Lahor.

or indifferent about them. His interest becomes greater when he
writes of Samana.

ad. Punishment of the Mundahirs.

When Babur, on his return journey, reached Sihrind, he
received a complaint from the Qazi of Samana against one
Mohan Mundahtr (or Mundhar)* Rajpit who had attacked his
estates, burning and plundering, and killed his son. Here-upon
‘Ali-quli of Hamadan? was sent with 3000 horse to avenge the
Qazi’s wrongs, and reached Mohan’s village, in the Kaithal
pargana, early in the morning when the cold was such that the
archers “could not pull their bows.”3 A marriage had been
celebrated over-night ; the villagers, issuing from warm houses,
shot such flights of arrows that the royal troops could make no
stand ; many were killed and nothing was effected; they retired
into the jungle, lit fires, warmed themselves (?), renewed the
attack and were again repulsed. On hearing of their failure,
Babur sent off, perhaps again from Sihrind, Tarsam Bahadur
and Naurang Beg with 6000 horse and many elephants. This
force reached the village at night and when marriage festivities
were in progress. Towards morning it was formed into three
divisions,t one of which was ordered to go to the west of the
village and show itself. This having been done, the villagers
advanced towards it, in the pride of their recent success. The
royal troops, as ordered beforehand, turned their backs and fled,
the Mundahirs pursuing them some two miles. Meantime
Tarsam Bahadur had attacked and fired the village, killing many
of its inhabitants. The pursuers on the west saw the flames of
their burning homes, ran back and were intercepted on their way.
About 1000 men, women and children were made prisoner ; there

* Cf. G, of I. xvi, §5 ; Ibbetson’s Report on Karnal.

It is noticeable that no one of the three royal officers named as sent against

Mohan Mundahir, is recognizable as mentioned in the Babur-nama. They may all
have had local commands, and not have served further east. Perhaps this, their

first appearance, points to the origin of the information as independent of Babur, but ~

he might have been found to name them, if his diary were complete for 936AH.

3 The E. and D. translation writes twice as though the inability to ‘‘ pull” the
bows were due to feebleness in the men, but an appropriate reading would refer the
difficulty to the hardening of sinews in the composite Turkish bows, which prevented
the archers from bending the bows for stringing.

‘* One infers that fires were burned all night in the bivouac.

was also great slaughter, and a pillar of heads was raised. Mohan
was captured and later on was buried to the waist and shot to
death with arrows.t News ofthe affair was sent to the Padshah.?

As after being in Sihrind, Babur is said to have spent two
months hunting near Dihli, it may be that he followed up the
punitive expedition sent into the Kaithal pargana of the Karnal
District, by hunting in Nardak, a favourite ground of the
Timirids, which lies in that district.

Thus the gap of 936 AH. with also perhaps a month of 937 AH.
is filled by the “year’s” travel west of Dihli. The record is
a mere outline and in it are periods of months without mention
of where Babur was or what affairs of government were brought
before him. At some time, on his return journey presumably,
he will have despatched to Kashmir the expedition referred to in
the opening section of this appendix. Something further may
yet be gleaned from local chronicles, from unwritten tradition, or
from the witness of place-names commemorating his visit.

é. Babur’s self-surrender to save Humayin.

The few months, perhaps 4 to 5, between Babur’s return to
Agra from his expedition towards the North-west, and the time
of his death are filled by Gul-badan and Abii’l-fazl with matters
concerning family interests only.

The first such matter these authors mention is an illness of
Humayiin during which Babur devoted his own life to save his
son’s.3 Of this the particulars are, briefly :—That Humayin,
while still in Sambhal, had had a violent attack of fever; that
he was brought by water to Agra, his mother meeting him in

* At this point the A.S.B. copy (No. 137) of the 7arikh-1-salatin-t-afaghana has
a@ remark which may have been a marginal note originally, and which cannot be
supposed made by Ahmad-i-yadgar himself because this would allot him too long
a spell of life. It may show however that the interpolations about the two Timirids
were not inserted in his book by him. Its purport is that the Mundahir village
destroyed by Babur’s troops in 936AH.—I530AD. was still in ruins at the time it
was written 160 (lunar) years later (z.e. in 1096AH.—1684-85 AD.). The better Codex
(No. 3887) of the Imperial Library of Calcutta has the same passage.—Both that
temark and its context show acquaintance with Samana and Kaithal.—The writings
Now grouped under the title 7a7ikh-7-salatin-t-afaghana present difficulties both as
to date and contents (cf. Rieu’s Persian Catalogue s.n.).

Muttra; and that when the disease baffled medical skill, Babur
resolved to practisethe rite believed then and now in the East to be
valid, of intercession and devotion of a suppliant’s most valued
possession in exchange for a sick man’s life. Rejecting counsel
to offer the Koh-i-nir for pious uses, he resolved to supplicate for
the acceptance of his life. He made intercession through a saint
his daughter names, and moved thrice round Humayin’s bed,
praying, in effect, “O God! if a life may be exchanged for a life,
I, who am Babur, give my life and my being for Humayin.”
During the rite fever surged over him, and, convinced that his —
prayer and offering had prevailed, he cried out, “I have borne
it away! I have borne it away!”  Gul-badan says that he
himself fell ill on that very day, while Humayin poured water
on his head, came out and gave audience; and that they carried
her Father within on account of his illness, where he kept his
bed for 2 or 3 months.

There can be no doubt as to Babur’s faith in the rite he had
practised, or as to his belief that his offering of life was accepted ;
moreover actual facts would sustain his faith and belief. On-
lookers also must have believed his prayer and offering to have
prevailed, since Humayiin went back to Sambhal,? while Babur
fell ill at once and died in a few weeks.3

J. A plan to set Babur’s sons aside from the succession.

Reading the Akbar-nama alone, there would seem to be no
question about whether Babur ever intended to give Hindustan,
at any rate, to Humayiin, but, by piecing together various con-
tributory matters, an opposite opinion is reached, vzz. that not
Khalifa only whom Abi’l-fazl names perhaps on Nizamu’d-din
Ahmad’s warrant, but Babur also, with some considerable numbe
of chiefs, wished another ruler for Hindistan. The starting-
point of this opinion is a story in the Zabagat-t-akbari and

* A closer translation would be, ‘‘I have taken up the burden.” The verb i
bardashtan (cf. £.349, p.626 n. 1).

? See Erskine’s History of India ii, 9.

3 At this point attention is asked to the value of the Ahmad-i-yadgar interpolatio
which allows Baibur a year of active life before Humayiin’s illness and his own whic
followed. With no chronicle known of 936AH. Babur had been supposed ill al
through the year, a supposition which destroys the worth of his self-sacrifice. Moreove’

several inferences have been drawn from the supposed year of illness which ar!
disproved by the activities recorded in that interpolation.

with less detail, in the Akéar-nama, of which the gist is that
Khalifa planned to supersede Humayiin and his three brothers
in their Father’s succession.”

The story, in brief, is as follows:—At the time of Babur’s
death Nizamu’d-din Ahmad’s father Khwaja Muhammad Mugqim
Harawi was in the service of the Office of Works.2 Amir
Nizamu’d-din ‘Ali Khalifa, the Chief of the Administration, had
dread and suspicion about Humayiin and did not favour his
succession as Padshah. Nor did he favour that of Babur’s other
sons. He promised “Babur Padshah’s son-in-law (damad)”
Mahdi Khwaja who was a generous young man, very friendly to
himself,thathe would make him Padshah. This promise becoming
known, others made their sadam to the Khwaja who put on airs
and accepted the position. One day when Khalifa, accompanied
by Muqim, went to see Mahdi Khwaja in his tent, no-one else
being present, Babur, in the pangs of his disease, sent for him 3
when he had been seated a few minutesonly. When Khalifa had
gone out, Mahdi Khwaja remained standing in such a way that
Mugim could not follow but, the Khwaja unaware, waited
respectfully behind him. The Khwaja, who was noted for the
wildness of youth, said, stroking his beard, “Please God ! first,
I will flay thee!” turned round and saw Muqim, took him by
the ear, repeated a proverb of menace, “The red tongue gives
the green head to the wind,” and let him go. Muqim hurried
to Khalifa, repeated the Khwaja’s threat against him, and
remonstrated about the plan to set all Babur’s sons aside in favour
of a stranger-house.t Here-upon Khalifa sent for Humayin,5
and despatched an officer with orders to the Khwaja to retire to
his house, who found him about to dine and hurried him off
without ceremony. Khalifa also issued a proclamation for-
bidding intercourse with him, excluded him from Court, and
when Babur died, supported Humayin.

704 TRANSLATOR’S NOTE

As Nizamu’d-din Ahmad was not born till 20 years after
Babur died, the story will have been old before he could
appreciate it, and it was some 60 years old when it found way
into the 7abagat-z-akbari and, with less detail, into the Akdar-
-nama.

Taken as it stands, it is incredible, because it represents
Khalifa, and him alone, planning to subject the four sons of Babur
to the suzerainty of Mahdi Khwaja who was not a Timirid,
who, so far as well-known sources show, was not of a ruling
dynasty or personally illustrious," and who had been associated,
so lately as the autumn of 1529 AD., with his nephew Rahim-dad
in seditious action which had so angered Babur that, whatever
the punishment actually ordered, rumour had it both men were to
die? In two particulars the only Mahdi Khwaja then of Babur’s
following, does not suit the story ; he was not a young man in
1530 AD.,3 and was not a damad of Babur, if that word be taken
in its usual sense of son-in-law, but he was a yagua, husband of
a Padshah’s sister, in his case, of Khan-zada Begim.4 Some
writers style him Sayyid Mahdi Khwaja, a double title which
may indicate descent on both sides from religious houses ; one
is suggested to be that of Tirmiz by the circumstance that in his
and Khan-zada Begim’s mausoleum was buried a Tirmiz sayyid

* Tam indebted to my husband’s perusal of Sayyid Ahmad Khan’s Asar-7-sanddid
(Dihli ed. 1854 p. 37, and Lakhnau ed. 1895 pp. 40, 41) for information that, perhaps
in 935AH., Mahdi Khwaja set up a tall slab of white marble near Amir Khusrau’s
tomb in Dihli, which bears an inscription in praise of the poet, composed by that
Shihabu’d-din the Enigmatist who reached Agra with Khwand-amir in Muharram
935 AH. (f. 339). The inscription gives two chronograms of Khusrau’s death (725 AH.),
mentions that Mahdi Khwaja was the creator of the memorial, and gives its date in
the words, ‘‘ The beautiful effort of Mahdi Khwaja.”—The Dihli ed. of the Asar-
z-sanadid depicts the slab with its inscription ; the Lakhnau ed. depicts the tomb,
may show the slab 2 sz¢@, and contains interesting matter by Sayyid Ahmad Khan.
The slab is mentioned without particulars in Murray’s Wand-book to Bengal, p. 329.

3 In an anonymous Life of Shah Ismail Safawi, Mahdi Khwaja [who may be
a son of the Misa Khwaja mentioned by Babur on f, 216] is described as being, in what
will be 916-7 AH., Babur’s Diwdn-begi and as sent towards Bukhara with 10,000 men.
This was 29 years before the story calls him a young man. Even if the word jawan
(young man) be read, as T. yigit is frequently to be read, in the sense of ‘‘ efficient
fighting man”, Mahdi was over-age. Other details of the story, besides the word
Jawan, bespeak a younger man.

of later date, Shah Abi’l-ma‘@li. But though he were of Tirmiz, it
is doubtful if that religious house would be described by the word
khanwada which so frequently denotes a ruling dynasty.

His name may have found its way into Nizamu’d-din Ahmad’s
story as a gloss mistakenly amplifying the word damad, taken in
its less usual sense of brother-in-law. To Babur’s contemporaries
the expression “ Babur Padshah’s daméd” (son-in-law) would be
explicit, because for some 11 years before he lay on his death-
bed, he had one son-in-law only, vz. Muhammad-i-zaman Mirza
Bai-gara,! the husband of Ma‘siima Sultan Begim. If that Mirza’s
name were where Mahdi Khwaja’s is entered, the story of an
exclusion of Babur’s sons from rule might have a core of truth.

It is incredible however that Khalifa, with or without Babur’s
concurrence, made the plan attributed to him of placing any
man not a Timiirid in the position of Padshah over all Babur’s
territory. I suggest that the plan concerned Hindistan only
and was one considered in connection with Babur’s intended
return to Kabul, when he must have left that difficult country,
hardly yet a possession, in charge of some man giving promise
of power to hold it. Such a man Humayiin was not. My
suggestion rests on the following considerations :—

(1) Babur’s outlook was not that of those in Agra in 1587 AD.
who gave Abii’l-fazl his Baburiana material, because at that date
Dihli had become the pivot of Timirid power, so that not to
hold Hindustan would imply not to be Padshah. Babur’s outlook
on his smaller Hindiistan was different ; his position in it was
precarious, Kabul, not Dihli, was his chosen centre, and from
Kabul his eyes looked northwards as well as to the East. If he
had lost the Hindistan which was approximately the modern
United Provinces, he might still have held what lay west of it
to the Indus, as well as Qandahar.

(2) For several years before his death he had wished to return
to Kabul. Ample evidence of this wish is given by his diary, his
letters, and some poems in his second Diwdn (that found in the
RampirMS.). Ashe told hissons more than once, he kept Kabul

* Babur, shortly before his death, married Gul-rang to Aisan-timir and Gul-chihra
to Takhta-bigha Chaghatai. Cf. post, Section , Babur’s wives and children ; and

for himself! If, instead of dying in Agra, he had returned to
Kabul, had pushed his way on from Badakhshan, whether as far
as Samarkand or less, had given Humayin a seat in those parts,
—action foreshadowed by the records—a reasonable inter-
pretation of the story that Humayin and his brothers were not
to govern Hindistan, is that he had considered with Khalifa the
apportionment of his territories according to the example of his
ancestors Chingiz Khan, Timiir and Abi-sa‘id ; that by his plan of
apportionment Humayiin was not to have Hindiistan but some-
thing Tramontane; Kamran had already Qandahar; Sulaiman,
if Humayiin had moved beyond the out-post of Badakhshan,
would have replaced him there; and Hindiistan would have gone
to “ Babur Padshah’s damad”.

(3) Muhammad-i-zaman had much to recommend him for
Hindiistan :—Timirid-born, grandson and heir of Sl. Husain
Mirza, husband of Ma‘sima who was a Timirid by double
descent,? protected by Babur after the Bai-qara débacle in Herat,
alandless man leading such other exiles as Muhammad Sultan
Mirza,3 ‘Adil Sultan, and Qasim-i-husain Sultan, half-Timirids
all, who with their Khurasani following, had been Babur’s guests
in Kabul, had pressed on its poor resources, and thus had helped
in 932 AH. (1525 AD.) to drive him across the Indus. This Bai-
qara group needed a location ; Muhammad-i-zaman’s future had
to be cared for and with his, Ma‘siima’s.

(4) It is significant of intention to give Muhammad-i-zaman
ruling status that in April 1529 Ap. (Sha‘ban 935 AH.) Babur
bestowed on him royal insignia, including the umbrella-symbol
of sovereignty.4 This was done after the Mirza had raised

? She is the only adult daughter of a Timiirid mother named as being such by
Babur or Gul-badan, but various considerations incline to the opinion that Dil-dar
Begim also was a Timiirid, hence her three daughters, all named from the Rose, were
so too. Cf. references of penultimate note.

3 It attaches interest to the Mirza that he can be taken reasonably as once the owner
of the Elphinstone Codex (cf. JRAS. 1907, pp. 136 and 137).

‘ Death did not threaten when this gift was made; life in Kabul was planned
for.—Here attention is asked again to the value of Ahmad-i-yadgar’s Baburiana for
removing the impression set on many writers by the blank year 936AH. that it was
one of illness, instead of being one of travel, hunting and sight-seeing. The details
of the activities of that year have the further value that they enhance the worth of

Babur’s sacrifice of life. —Haidar Mirza also fixes the date of the beginning of illness
as 937 AH.

objections, unspecified now inthe Bdbur-nama againstBihar ; they
were overcome, the insignia were given and, though for military
reasons he was withheld from taking up that appointment, the
recognition of his royal rank had been made. His next appoint-
ment was to Jiinpiir, ‘the capital of the fallen Sharqi dynasty.
No other chief is mentioned by Babur as receiving the insignia
of royalty.

(4) It appears to have been within a Padshah’s competence to
select his successor; and it may be inferred that choice was
made between Humayin and another from the wording of more
than one writer that Khalifa “supported” Humayin, and from
the word “selected” used in Ahmad-i-yadgar’s anecdote.?_ Much
more would there be freedom of choice in a division of territory
such as there is a good deal to suggest was the basis of Nizamu’d-
din Ahmad’s story. Whatever the extent of power proposed for
the damad, whether, as it is difficult to believe, the Padshah’s
whole supremacy, or whether the limited sovereignty of Hindi-
stan, it must have been known to Babur as well as to Khalifa.
Whatever their earlier plan however, it was changed by the
sequel of Humiayin’s illness which led to his becoming Padshah.
The damad was dropped, on grounds it is safe to believe more
impressive than his threat to flay Khalifa or than the remonstrance
of that high official’s subordinate Muqim of Herat.

Humayin’s arrival and continued stay in Hindiistan modified
earlier dispositions which included his remaining in Badakhshan.
His actions may explain why Babur, when in 936 AH. he went
as far as Lahor, did not goon to Kabul. Nothing in the sources
excludes the surmise that Mahim knew of the bestowal of royal
insignia on the Bai-qara Mirza, that she summoned her son to
Agra and there kept him, that she would do this the more
resolutely if the damad of the plan she must have heard of, were
that Bai-qara, and that but for Humayin’s presence in Agra and
its attendant difficulties, Babur would have gone to Kabul, leaving
his damad in charge of Hindustan.

Babur, however, turned back from Lahor for Agra, and there

nama well, or he would not have described Babur as a wine-drinker after 933 AH.
The anecdote is parallel with Nizamu’d-din Ahmad’s, the one explaining why the
Mirza was selected, the other why the damdd was dropped.

he made the self-surrender which, resulting in Huméayin’s
“selection” as Padshah, became a turning point in history.

Humiyiin’s recovery and Babur’s immediate illness will have
made the son’s life seem Divinely preserved, the father’s as a debt
to be paid. Babur’s impressive personal experience will have
dignified Humayin as one whom God willed should live. Such
distinction would dictate the bestowal on him of all that fatherly
generosity had yet togive. The imminence of death defeating
all plans made for life) Humayitin was nominated to supreme
power as Padshah.

g. Babur’s death.

Amongst other family matters mentioned by Gul-badan as
occurring shortly before her Father’s death, was his arrangement
of marriages for Gul-rang with Aisan-timir and for Gul-chihra
with Takhta-bigha Chaghatai. She also writes of his anxiety
to see Hind-al who had been sent for from Kabul but did not
arrive till the day after the death.

When no remedies availed, Humayitin was summoned from
Sambhal. He reached Agra four days before the death ; on the
morrow Babur gathered his chiefs together for the last of many
times, addressed them, nominated Humayin his successor and
bespoke their allegiance for him. Abii’l-fazl thus summarizes his
words, “ Lofty counsels and weighty mandates were imparted.
Advice was given (to Humayiin) to be munificent and just, to
acquire God’s favour, to cherish and protect subjects, to accept
apologies from such as had failed in duty, and to pardon trans-
gressors. And, he (Babur) exclaimed, the cream of my testa-
mentary dispositions is this, ‘Do naught against your brothers,
even though they may deserve it. In truth,” continues the
historian, “it was through obedience to this mandate that his
Majesty Jannat-ashiyani suffered so many injuries from his
brothers without avenging himself.” Gul-badan’s account of her
Father’s last address is simple:—“He spoke in this wise, ‘For
years it has been in my heart to make over the throne to
Humayin and to retire to the Gold-scattering Garden. By the
Divine grace I have obtained in health of body everything but
the fulfilment of this wish. Now that illness has laid me low,



--- Page 277 ---
936 To 937 AH.—1529 To 1530 AD. 709

I charge you all to acknowledge Humayin in my stead. Fail
notin loyalty towards him. Be of one heart and mind towards
him. JI hope to God that he, for his part, will bear himself well
towards men. Moreover, Humayiin, I commit you and your
brothers and all my kinsfolk and your people and my people
to God’s keeping, and entrust them all to you.’”

It was on Monday Jumada I. 5th 937 AH. (Dec. 26th 1530AD.)
that Babur made answer to his summons with the Adsum of the
Musalman, “ Lord! I am here for Thee.”

“Black fell the day for children and kinsfolk and all,” writes
his daughter ;

** Alas! that time and the changeful heaven should exist without thee ;

Alas ! and Alas ! that time should remain and thou shouldst be gone ;”
mourns Khwaja Kalan in the funeral ode from which Badayini
quoted these lines.* -

The body was laid in the Garden-of-rest (Aram-bagh) which
is opposite to where the Taj-i-mahall now stands. Khwaja
Muhammad ‘Ali ‘asas? was made the guardian of the tomb,
and many well-voiced readers and reciters were appointed to
conduct the five daily Prayers and to offer supplication for the
soul of the dead. The revenues of Sikri and 5/aks from Biana
were set aside for the endowment of the tomb, and Mahim
Begim, during the two and a half years of her remaining life,
sent twice daily from her own estate, an allowance of food
towards the support of its attendants.

In accordance with the directions of his will, Babur’s body was
to be conveyed to Kabul and there to be laid in the garden of his
choice, in a grave open to the oe with no building over it, no
need of a door-keeper.

Precisely when it was removed from Agra we have not found
stated. It is known from Gul-badan that Kamran visited his
Father’s tomb in Agra in 1539AD. (946AH.) after the battle of
Chausa ; and it is known from Jauhar that the body had been
brought to Kabul before 1544AD. (952AH.), at which date
Humayin, in Kabul, spoke with displeasure of Kamran’s in-
civility to “ Bega Begim ”, the “ Bibi” who had conveyed their

Father’s body to that place.t* That the widow who performed
this duty was the Afghan Lady, Bibi Mubarika? is made
probable by Gul-badan’s details of the movements of the royal
ladies. Babur’s family left Agra under Hind-al’s escort, after the
defeat at Chausa (June 7th, 1539 AD.); whoever took charge of
the body on its journey to Kabul must have returned at some
later date to fetch it. It would be in harmony with Sher Shah’s
generous character if he safe-guarded her in her task.

The terraced garden Babur chose for his burial-place lies on
the slope of the hill Shah-i-Kabul, the Sher-darwaza of European
writers.3 It has been described as perhaps the most beautiful
of the Kabul gardens, and as looking towards an unsurpassable
view over the Char-dih plain towards the snows of Paghman
and the barren, rocky hills which have been the hunting-grounds
of rulers in Kabul. Several of Babur’s descendants coming to
Kabul from Agra have visited and embellished his burial-garden.
Shah-i-jahan built the beautiful mosque which stands near the
grave ; Jahangir seems to have been, if not the author, at least
the prompter of the well-cut inscription adorning the upright
slab of white marble of Maidan, which now stands at the grave-
head. The tomb-stone itself is a low grave-covering, not less
simple than those of relations and kin whose remains have been
placed near Babur’s. In the thirties of the last century [the
later Sir] Alexander Burnes visited and admirably described
the garden and the tomb. With him was Munshi Mohan Lal who
added to his own account of the beauties of the spot, copies of
the inscriptions on the monumental slab and on the portal of the
Mosque.4 As is shown by the descriptions these two visitors
give, and by Daniel’s drawings of the garden and the tomb,
there were in their time two upright slabs, one behind the other,
near the head of the grave. Mr. H. H. Hayden who visited the
garden in the first decade of the present century, shows in his
photograph of the grave, one upright stone only, the place of

The purport of the verses inscribed on the standing-slab is
as follows :—

A ruler from whose brow shone the Light of God was that?
Back-bone of the Faith (gahiru’d-din) Muhammad Babur
Padshah. Together with majesty, dominion, fortune, rectitude,
the open-hand and the firm Faith, he had share in prosperity,
abundance and the triumph of victorious arms. He won the
material world and became a moving light; for his every
conquest he looked, as for Light, towards the world of souls.

the date, I gave him for answer, “Paradise is forever Babur
Padshah’s abode.”

Gul-badan is the authority for complete lists of them and their
children.

shaht was betrothed, when Babur was czr. 5 years old, in 894.AH.
(1488-89 aD.), bore Fakhru’n-nisa’ in 906 AH. [who died in about
one month], left Babur before 909 AH. (1503 AD.).

2. Zainab Sl. Begim, daughter of Sl. Mahmiid Mirza J7Ziran-
shahi, was married in 91OAH. (1504-5 AD.), died childless two or
three years later.

3. Mahim Begim, whose parentage is not found stated, was
married in 912AH. (1506AD.), bore Bar-biid, Mihr-jin, Aisan-
daulat, Fariiq [who all died in infancy], and Humayin.

4. Ma‘siima S]. Begim, daughter of Sl. Ahmad Mirza Miran-
Shahi, was married in 913 AH. (1507 AD.), bore Ma‘sima and died
at her birth, presumably early in the /acuna of 914-925 AH.
(1508-19 AD.).

writers of their time, can be seen in my Biographical Appendix to the Begim’s

married in the same period as Gul-rukh, bore Gul-rang, Gul-
chihra, Hind-al, Gul-badan and Alwar, [who died in childhood].

7. The Afghan Lady(Afghani Aghacha), Bibi Mubarika Visuf-
sai, was married in 925 AH. (1519 AD.), and died childless.

The two Circassian slaves Gul-nar Aghacha and Nar-gul
Aghacha of whom Tahmasp made gift to Babur in 933AH.
(f.305), became recognized ladies of the royal household. They
are mentioned several times by Gul-badan as taking part in
festivities and in family conferences under Humayiin. Gul-nar
is said by Abi’l-fazl to have been one of Gul-badan’s pilgrim
band in 983 AH. (1575 AD.).

The above list contains the names of three wives whose
parentage is not given or is vaguely given by the well-known
sources,—namely, Mahim, Gul-rukh and Dil-dar. What would
sufficiently explain the absence of mention by Babur of the
parentage of Gul-rukh and Dil-dar is that his record of the years
within which the two Begims were married is not now with the
Babur-nama. Presumably it has been lost, whether in diary or
narrative form, in the /ecuna of 914-25 AH. (1508-19 AD.). Gul-
rukh appears to have belonged to the family of Begchik Mughils
described by Haidar Mirza"; her brothers are styled Mirza; she
was of good but not royal birth. Dil-dar’s case is less simple.
Nothing in her daughter Gul-badan’s book suggests that she and
her children were other than of the highest rank ; numerous
details and shades of expression show their ease of equality with
royal personages. It is consistent with Gul-badan’s method of
enumerating her father’s wives that she should not state her own
mother’s descent; she states it of none of her “mothers”. There
is this interest in trying to trace Dil-dar’s parentage, that she
may have been the third daughter of Sl. Mahmiid Mirza and
Pasha Begim, and a daughter of hers may have been the mother of

* Tarikh-t-rashidi trs. Ney Elias and Ross p. 308.

936 To 937 AH.—1529 To 1530 AD. 713

Salima Sultan Begim who was given in marriage by Humayin
to Bairam Khan, later was married by Akbar, and was a woman
of charm and literary accomplishments. Later historians, Abi’l-
faz] amongst their number, say that Salima’s mother was a
daughter of Babur’s wife Salha Sultan Begim, and vary that
daughter’s name as Gul-rang-rukh-barg or -‘izar (the last form
being an equivalent of chzhra, face). Asthere cannot have been
a wife with her daughter growing up in Babur’s household, who
does not appear in some way in Gul-badan’s chronicle, and as
Salima’s descent from Babur need not be questioned, the knot is
most readily loosened by surmising that “Salha” is the real name
of Gul-badan’s “Dildar”. Instances of double names are frequent,
eg. Mahim, Mah-chicham, Qara-giiz, Aq, (My Moon, My Moon
sister, Black-eyed, Fair). ‘“Heart-holding” (Dil-dar) sounds like
a home-name of affection. It is the Ma‘astr-i-rahimi which gives
Salha as the name of Babur’s wife, Pasha’s third daughter. Its
author may be wrong, writing so late as he did(1025AH.—I616AD.),
or may have been unaware that Salha was (if she were) known as
Dil-dar. It would not war against seeming facts to take Pasha’s
third daughter to be Babur’s wife Dil-dar, and Dil-dar’s daughter
Gul-chihra to be Salima’s mother. Gul-chihra was born in about
I516AD., married to Tiikhta-bagha in 1530 AD., widowed in cr.
1533 AD., might have remarried with Niru’d-din Chaganiani
(Sayyid Amir), and in 945 AH. might have borne him Salima; she
Was married in 1547 AD. (954AH.) to ‘Abbas Sultan Adzbeg.t
Two matters, neither having much weight, make against taking
Dil-dar to be a Miran-shahi; the first being that the anonymous
annotator who added to the archetype of Kehr’s Codex what is
entered in Appendix L.-Ox Mahim’s adoption of Hind-dl, styles
her Dil-dar Aghicha ; he, however, may have known no more
than others knew of her descent ; the second, that Mahim forcibly
took Dil-dar’s child Hind-al to rear; she was the older wife and
the mother of the heir, but could she have taken the upper hand
over a Miran-shahi? A circumstance complicating the question
of Salima’s maternal descent is, that historians searching the
Babur-naéma or its Persian translation the Wag7‘at-c-baburi for
information about the three daughters of Mahmiid Miran-shahi
t Bio. App. 5.7. Gul-chihra.


--- Page 282 ---
714 TRANSLATOR’S NOTE

and Pasha Baharli Turkman, would find an incomplete record,
one in which the husbands of the first and second daughters are
mentioned and nothing is said about the third who was Babur’s
wife and the grandmother of Salima. Babur himself appears to
have left the record as it is, meaning to fill it in later; presumably
he waited for the names of the elder two sisters to complete his
details of the three. In the Haidarabad Codex, which there is
good ground for supposing a copy of his original manuscript,
about three lines are left blank (f. 27) as if awaiting information;
in most manuscripts, however, this indication of intention is
destroyed by running the defective passage on to join the next
sentence. Some chance remark of a less well-known writer,
may clear up the obscurity and show that Salha was Dil-dar.

Mahim’s case seems one having a different cause for silence
about her parentage. When she was married in Herat, shortly
after the death of SI. Husain Mirza, Babur had neither wife nor
child. What Abi’l-fazl tells about her is vague ; her father’s name
is not told; she is said to have belonged to a noble Khurasan
family, to have been related (sdsbat-c-khwesh) to Sl. Husain
Mirza and to have traced her descent to Shaikh Ahmad of Jam.
If her birth had been high, even though not royal, it is strange
that it is not stated by Babur when he records the birth of her
son Humayin, incidentally by Gul-badan, or more precisely by
Abi’l-fazl. Her brothers belonged to Khost, and to judge from a
considerable number of small records, seem to have been quiet,
unwarlike Khwajas. Her marriage took place in a year of which
a full record survives ; it is one in the composed narrative, not
in the diary. In the following year, this also being one included
in the composed narrative, Babur writes of his meeting with
Ma‘sima Miran-shahi in Herat, of their mutual attraction, and
of their marriage. If the marriage with Humayin’s mother had
been an equal alliance, it would agree with Babur’s custom to
mention its occurrence, and to give particulars about Mahim’s
descent." ;

* The story of the later uprisings against Mahim’s son Humayin by his brothers,
by Muhammad-i-zamin Bdi-gara and others of the same royal blood, and this in
spite of Humayiin’s being his father’s nominated successor, stirs surmise as to whether
the rebels were not tempted by more than his defects of character to disregard his
claim to supremacy; perhaps pride of higher maternal descent, this particularly
amongst the Bai-qara group, may have deepened a disregard created by antagonisms
of temperament.

1. Mr. William Erskine's estimate of Babur.

“Zahiru’d-din Muhammad Babur was undoubtedly one of the
most illustrious men of his age, and one of the most eminent
and accomplished princes that ever adorned an Asiatic throne.
He is represented as having been above the middle size, of great
vigour of body, fond of all field and warlike sports, an excellent
swordsman, and a skilful archer. As a proof of his bodily
strength, it is mentioned, that he used to leap from one pinnacle
to another of the pinnacled ramparts used in the East, in his
double-soled boots; and that he even frequently took a man
under each arm and went leaping along the rampart from one of
the pointed pinnacles to another. Having been early trained
to the conduct of business, and tutored in the school of adversity,
the powers of his mind received full development. He ascended
the throne at the age of twelve, and before he had attained his
twentieth year, had shared every variety of fortune ; he had not
only been the ruler of subject provinces but had been in thraldom
to his own ambitious nobles, and obliged to conceal every senti-
ment of his heart; he had been alternately hailed and obeyed as
a conqueror and deliverer by rich and extensive kingdoms, and
forced to lurk in the deserts and mountains of Farghana as
a houseless wanderer. Down to the last dregs of life, we perceive
in him strong feelings of affection for his early friends and early
enjoyments. * * * He had been taught betimes, by the voice
of events that cannot lie, that he was a man dependent on the
kindness and fidelity of other men; and, in his dangers and
escapes with his followers, had learned that he was only one of
an association. * * * The native benevolence and gaiety of his
disposition seems ever to overflow on all around him; * * * ofhis
companions in arms he speaks with the frank gaiety of a soldier.
*** Ambitious he was and fond of conquest and glory in all
its shapes; the enterprise in which he was for a season engaged,
seems to have absorbed his whole soul, and all his faculties were
exerted to bring it to a fortunate issue. His elastic mind was
not broken by discomfiture, and few who have achieved such
glorious conquests, have suffered more numerous or more decisive
defeats. His personal courage was conspicuous during his whole
life. Upon the whole, if we review with impartiality the history

716 TRANSLATOR’S NOTE

of Asia, we find few princes entitled to rank higher than
in genius and accomplishments. * * * In activity of mi
the gay equanimity and unbroken spirit with which he

extremes of good and bad fortune, in the possession of the
and social virtues, in his love of letters and his success in
cultivation of them, we shall probably find no other Asiati
prince who can justly be placed beside him.”

A.—THE SITE AND DISAPPEARANCE OF
OLD AKHSI.

SOME modern writers, amongst whom are Dr. Schuyler,
General Nalivkine and Mr. Pumpelly, have inferred from the
Babur-nama account of Akhsi, (in its translations?) that the
landslip through which Babur’s father died and the disappear-
ance of old Akhsi were brought about by erosion. Seen by the
light of modern information, this erosion theory does not seem
to cover the whole ground and some other cause seems
necessary in explanation of both events.

For convenience of reference, the Babur-nima passages re-
quired, are quoted here, with their translations.

(6) Erskine (p. 5, translating from the Persian) : ‘ The river Saihin
flows under the walls of the castle. The castle is situated on a high
precipice, and the steep ravines around serve instead of amoat. When
U. Sh. M. made it his capital he,in one or two instances, scarped the
ravines outside the fort.’

(c) De Courteille (i, 8, translating from Ilminsky’s imprint, p. 6) :

d’un ravin, dont les profondeurs lui tiennent lieu d’un fossé. ‘U. Sh.

kabitar-khana bila atichib shungar buldi;—‘ It has been mentioned
that the walled-town of Akhsi is situated above ravine(s). The royal
dwellings are along a ravine. The Mirza, having flown with his
pigeons and their house from the ravine, became a falcon (#.e. died).’

A few particulars about Akhsi will shew that, in the transla-
tions just quoted, certain small changes of wording are dictated
by what, amongst other writers, Kostenko and von Schwarz
have written about the oases of Turkistan.

The name Akhsi, as used by Ibn Haukal, Yaqit and Babur,
describes an oasis township, i.e. a walled-town with its adjacent
cultivated lands. In Yaqiit’s time Akhsi had a second circum-
vallation, presumably less for defence than for the protection of ©
crops against wild animals. The oasis was created by the
Kasan-water,! upon the riverain loess of the right and higher
bank of the Saihiin (Sir), on level ground west of the junction
of the Narin and the Qard-darya, west too of spurs from the
northern hills which now abut upon the river. Yaqut locates
it in the rath century, at one farsdkh (circa 4 m.) north of
the river.2 Depending as it did solely on the Kasan-water,
nothing dictated its location close to the Sir, along which there
is now, and there seems to have been in the 12th century, a
strip of waste land. Babur says of Akhsi what Kostenko says
(i, 321) of modern Tashkint, that it stood above ravines (jarlar).
These were natural or artificial channels of the Kasan-water.?

To turn now to the translations ;—Mr. Erskine imaged Akhsi
as a castle, high on a precipice in process of erosion by the Sir.
But Babur’s word, girghdn means the walled-town; his for a
castle is ark, citadel; and his jar, a cleft, is not rendered by
‘precipice.’ Again ;—it is no more necessary to understand that

. 1 Until the Yangi-driq was taken off the Sir, late in the last century, for
Namangan, the oasis land of Farghana was fertilized, not from the river but
by its intercepted tributaries.

* Ujfalvy’s translation of Yaqiit (ii, 179) reads one faysakh from the
mountains instead of ‘ north of the river.’

! Kostenko describes a division of Tashkint, one in which is Ravine-lane
(Gar-kucha), as divided by a deep ravine ; of another he says that it is cut by
deep ravines (Babur’s 'umiq jarlar).



--- Page 287 ---
A.—THE SITE AND DISAPPEARANCE OF OLD AKHSI iii

the Sir flowed close to the walls than it is to understand, when
one says the Thames flows past below Richmond, that it
washes the houses on the hill.

The key to the difficulties in the Turki passage is provided
by a special use of the word jar for not only natural ravines
but artificial water-cuts for irrigation. This use of it makes
clear that what ‘Umar Shaikh did at Akhsi was not to make
escarpments but to cut new water-channels. Presumably he
joined those ‘further out’ on the deltaic fan, on the east and
west of the town, so as to secure a continuous defensive cleft
round the town! or it may be, in order to bring it more water.

Concerning the historic pigeon-house (f. 6b), it can be said
safely that it did not fall into the Sir; it fell from a jar, and in
this part of its course, the river flows in a broad bed, with a
low left bank. Moreover the Mirza’s residence was in the
walled-town (f. 1100) and there his son stayed g years after the
accident. The slip did not affect the safety of the residence
therefore ; it may have been local to the birds’ house. It will
have been due to some ordinary circumstance since no cause
for it is mentioned by Babur, Haidar or Abi’l-fazl. If it had
marked the crisis of the Sir’s approach, Akhsi could hardly
have been described, 25 years later, as a strong fort.

Something is known of Akhsi, in the roth, the 12th, the
15th and the xgth centuries, which testifies to szecular
decadence. Ibn Haukal and Ydqiit give the township an ex-
tent of 3 farsakh (12 miles), which may mean from one side to
an opposite one. Ydaqut’s description of it mentions four
gates, each opening into well-watered lands extending a whole
farsakh, in other words it had a ring of garden-suburb four
miles wide.

Two meanings have been given to Babur’s words indicat-
ing the status of the oasis in the 15th century. They are,

1 Babur writes as though Akhsi had one Gate only (f. 1126). It is unlikely
that the town had come down to having a single exit ; the Gate by which he
got out of Akhsi was the one of military importance ‘because served by a

draw-bridge, presumably over the ravine-moat, and perhaps not close to
that bridge.

mahallati qirghan-din bir shar yurdqrag tishib tir. They
have been understood as saying that the suburbs were two
miles from their uvbs. This may be right but I hesitate to
accept it without pointing out that the words may mean, ‘Its
suburbs extend two miles farther than the walled-town.’
Whichever verbal reading is correct, reveals a decayed oasis.

In the 1rgth century, Nalivkine and Ujfalvy describe the
place then bearing the name Akhsi, as a small village, a
mere winter-station, at some distance from the river’s bank,
that bank then protected from denudation by a sand-bank.

Three distinctly-marked stages of decadence in the oasis
township are thus indicated by Yaqut, Babur and the two
modern travellers.

It is necessary to say something further about the position of
the suburbs in the 15th century. Babur quotes as especially
suitable to Akhsi, the proverbial questions, ‘Where is the
village ?’+ (qy. Akhsi-kint.) ‘Where are the trees?’ and these
might be asked by some-one in the suburbs unable to see Akhsi
or vice versd. But granting that there were no suburbs within
two miles of the town, why had the whole inner circle, two
miles of Yaqit’s four, gone out of cultivation? Erosion would
have affected only land between the river and the town.

Again ;—if the Sir only were working in the 15th century
to destroy a town standing on the Kasan-water, how is it that
this stream does not yet reach the Sir?

Various ingatherings of information create the impression
that failure of Kasan-water has been the dominant factor in
the loss of the Akhsi township. Such failure might be due to
the general desiccation of Central Asia and also to increase of
cultivation in the Kasan-valley itself. There may have been
erosion, and social and military change may have had its part,
but for the loss of the oasis lands and for, as a sequel, the de-
cay of the town, desiccation seems a sufficient cause.

1 For mention of upper villages see f. 110 and note 1.



--- Page 289 ---
A.—THE SITE AND DISAPPEARANCE OF OLD AKHSI v

The Kasan-water still supports an oasis on its riverain slope,
the large Atzbeg town of Tupa-qtrghan (Town-of-the-hill),
from the modern castle of which a superb view is had up the
Kasan-valley, now thickly studded with villages.?

B.—THE BIRDS, QIL QUYIRUGH AND
BAGHRI QARA.

DESCRIBING a small bird (gish-qina), abundant in the Qarshi
district (f. 490), Babur names it the gil-qiyiriigh, horse-tail, and
says it resembles the baghr1 qara.

Later on he writes (f. 280) that the baghri gard of India is
smaller and more slender than ‘those’ i.e. of Transoxiana
(f. 49b, n. 1), the blackness of its breast less deep, and its cry
less piercing.

We have had difficulty in identifying the birds but at length
conclude that the baghrt gard of Transoxiana is Pterocles
arenarius, Pallas’s black-bellied sand-grouse and that the Indian
one is a smaller sand-grouse, perhaps a Syrrhaptes. As the qil
quyivugh resembles the other two, it may be a yet pe
Syrrhaptes.

Muh. Salih, writing of sport Shaibaq Khan had in Qarshi
(Shaibani-nama, Vambéry, p. 192) mentions the ‘ Little bird
(murghak) of Qarshi,’ as on all sides making lament. The
Sang-lakh ? gives its Persian name as khar-pala, ass-hair, says it

flies in large flocks and resembles the baéghri gard. Of the
latter he writes as abundant in the open country and as
making noise (baghir).

The Sang-lakh (f. 119) gives the earliest and most informing
account we have found of the baghri gard. Its says the bird is
larger than a pigeon, marked with various colours, yellow
especially, black-breasted and a dweller in the stony and water-
less desert. These details are followed by a quotation from
‘Ali-sher Nawd’i, in which he likens his own heart to that of
the bird of the desert, presumably referring to the gloom of the
bird’s plumage. Three synonyms are then given; Ar. gitd, one
due to its cry (Meninsky); Pers. sang-shikan, stone-eating,
(Steingass, sang-khwara, stone-eating); and Turki baghir-tilag
which refers, I think, to its cry.

Morier (Haji Baba) in his Second journey through Persia
(Lond. 1818, p. 181), mentions that a bird he calls the black-
breasted partridge, (i.e. Francolinus vulgaris) is known in
Turkish as bokara kava and in Persian as siyah-sina, both names,
(he says), meaning black-breast; that it has a horse-shoe of
black feathers round the forepart of the trunk, more strongly
marked in the female than in the male; that they fly in flocks
of which he saw immense numbers near Tabriz (p. 283), have
a soft note, inhabit the plains, and, once settled, do not run.
Cock and hen alike have a small spur,—a characteristic, it may
be said, identifying rather with Francolinus vulgaris than with
Pterocles arenarius. Against this identification, however, is
Mr. Blandford’s statement that siya@h-sina (Morier’s bokara kara)
is Pterocles arenarius (Report of the Persian Boundary Com-
mission, ii, 271).

In Afghanistan and Bikanir, the sand-grouse is called tatirak
and boora kurra (Jerdon, ii, 498). Scully explains baghitdq as
Pterocles arenarius. ‘

Perhaps I may mention something making me doubt whether
it is correct to translate baghri gard by black-liver and gorge-noir
or other names in which the same meaning is expressed. To
translate thus, is to understand a Turki noun and adjective in


--- Page 291 ---
B.—THE BIRDS QIZ QUYJRUGH AND BAGHRI QARA vii

Persian construction, and to make exception to the rule, amply
exemplified in lists of birds, that Turki names of birds are
commonly in Turki construction, e.g. gard bash (black-head),
aig-bash (white-head), sdrigh-suinduk (yellow-headed wagtail).
Baghiy may refer to the cry of the bird. We learn from
Mr. Ogilvie Grant that the Mongol name for the sand-grouse
njupterjin, is derived from its cry in flight, truck, truck, and its
Arabic name qifa@ is said by Meninsky to be derived from its
cry kaetha, kactha. Though the dissimilarity of the two cries is
against taking the mjapterjin and the qifa to be of one class of
sand-grouse, the significance of the derivation of the names
remains, and shows that there are examples in support of
thinking that when a sand-grouse is known as bdghri qard, it
may be so known because of its cry (baghir).

The word garda finds suggestive interpretation in a B. N.
phrase (f. 72b) Tanvbal-ning qara-si, Tambal’s blackness, 7.¢. the
dark mass of his moving men, seen at a distance. It is used
also for an indefinite number, e.g. ‘family, servants, retainers,
followers, gard,’ and I think it may imply a massed flock.

Babur’s words (f. 280) baghri-ning qara-st ham kam dir, [its
belly (lit. liver) also is less black], do not necessarily contradict
the view that the word baghri in the bird’s name means crying.
The root baégh has many and pliable derivatives; I suspect
both Babur (here) and Muh. Salih (1. c.) of ringing changes
on words.

We are indebted for kind reply to our questions to Mr.
Douglas Carruthers, Mr. Ogilvie Grant and to our friend,
Mr. R. S. Whiteway.

C.—ON THE GOSH4-GIR.

I AM indebted to my husband’s examination of two Persian
MSS. on archery for an explanation of the word gosha-gir, in
its technical sense in archery. The works consulted are the
Cyclopedia of Archery (Kulliyatw’y-vami 1. O. 2771) and the
Archer’s Guide (Hidaéyatw’r-rami I. O. 2768).
It should be premised that in archery, the word gosha de-
scribes, in the arrow, the notch by which it grips and can be
carried on the string, and, in the bow, both the tip (horn) and
the notch near the tip in which the string catches. It is ex-
plained by Vullers as cornu et crena arctis cui immititur nervus.
Two passages in the Cyclopedia of Archery (f. 9 and f. 360)
shew gosha as the bow-tip. One says that to bend the bow,
two men must grasp the two gosha; the other reports a tradition
that the Archangel Gabriel brought a bow having its two gosha
(tips) made of ruby. The same book directs that the gosha be
made of seasoned ivory, the Archer’s Guide prescribing seasoned
mulberry wood.
The C. of A. (f. 125) says that a bowman should never be
without two things, his arrows and his gosha-gir. The gosha-gir
may be called an item of the repairing kit; it is an implement
(f. 53) for making good a warped bow-tip and for holding th
string into a displaced notch. It is known also as the chapra.
brooch or buckle, and the kardang; and is said to bear thes
names because it fastens in the string. Its shape is that of th
upper part of the Ar. letter jm, two converging lines of whic
the lower curves slightly outward. It serves to make good
warped bow, without the use of fire and it should be kept upo
the bow-tip till this has reverted to its original state. Unt
the warp has been straightened by the gosha-gir, the bow mu
be kept from the action of fire because it, (composite of sine
and glutinous substance,) is of the nature of wax.
The same implement can be used to straighten the middle
the bow, the kamdn khadna. It is then called kar-dang. Itc

C.—ON THE GOSHA-GIR ix

be used there on condition that there are not two daur (curves)
in the bow. If there are two the bow cannot be repaired with-
out fire. The halal dauy is said to be characteristic of the
Turkish bow. Thereare three daur. Iam indebted to Mr. Inigo
Simon for the suggestions that daur in this connection means
warp and that the three twists (dawr) may be those of one horn
(gosha), of the whole bow warped in one curve, and of the two
horns warped in opposite directions.

Of repair to the kamdan-khana it is said further that if no kar-
dang be available, its work can be done by means of a stick and
string, and if the damage be slight only, the bow and the string
can be tightly tied together till the bow comes straight. ‘And
the cure is with God!’

Both manuscripts named contain much technical informa-
tion. Some parts of this are included in my husband’s article,
Oriental Crossbows (A.Q.R. Ig1I, p. 1). Sir Ralph Payne-Gall-
wey’s interesting book on the Cross-bow allows insight into
the fine handicraft of Turkish bow-making.

D.—ON THE RESCUE PASSAGE.

I HAVE omitted from my translation an account of Babur’s
rescue from expected death, although it is with the Haidarabad
Codex, because closer acquaintance with its details has led both
my husband and myself to judge it spurious. We had wel-
comed it because, being with the true Babur-nama text, it
accredited the same account found in the Kehr-Ilminsky text,
and also because, however inefficiently, it did something
towards filling the gap found elsewhere within 908 AH.

It is in the Haidarabad MS. (f. 118d), in Kehr’s MS. (p. 385),
in Ilminsky’s imprint (p. 144), in Les Mémoires de Babour (i, 255)

and with the St. P, University Codex, which is a copy of
Kehr’s,

ve APPENDICES

On the other hand, it is not with the Elphinstone Codex
(f. 894); that it was not with the archetype of that codex the
scribe’s note shews (f. 90); it is with neither of the Waqi‘at-i-
baburvi (Pers. translations) nor with Leyden and Erskine’s
Memoirs (p. 122).2

Before giving our grounds tor rejecting what has been offered
to fill the gap of go8 aH. a few words must be said about the
lacuna itself. Nothing indicates that Babur left it and, since
both in the Elphinstone Codex and its archetype, the sentence
preceding it lacks the terminal verb, it seems due merely to
loss of pages. That the loss, if any, was of early date is clear,—
the Elph. MS. itself being copied not later than 1567 aD. (J RAS.
1907, p. 137).

Two known circumstances, both of earlier date than that of
the Elphinstone Codex, might have led to the loss,—the first is
the storm which in 935 AH. scattered Babur’s papers (f. 3760),
the second, the vicissitudes to which Humayin’s library was
exposed in his exile.2 Of the two the first seems the more
probable cause.

The rupture of a story at a point so critical as that of Babur’s
danger in Karnan would tempt to its completion; so too would
wish to make good the composed part of the Babur-nama.
Humiayiin annotated the archetype of the Elphinstone Codex
a good deal but he cannot have written the Rescue passage if
only because he was in a position to avoid some of its inac-
curacies.

CONTEXT AND TRANSLATION OF THE RESCUE
PASSAGE.

To facilitate reference, I quote the last words preceding the
gap purported to be filled by the Rescue passage, from severa
texts ;—

1 The Padshah-nama whose author, ‘Abdu’l-hamid, the biographer of
Shah-jahan, died in 1065 an. (1655 AD.) mentions the existence of lacune in
a copy of the Babur-nama, in the Imperial Library and allowed by his wording
to be Babur’s autograph MS. (i, 42 and ii, 703).

I brought it to my mind that if a person be alive 100 years

or a thousand years, at last he has no help other than
to die.)

The Rescue passage is introduced by a Persian couplet,
identified by my husband as from Nigami’s Khusrau u Shirin,

was two days that we had eaten no food ; the evening prayer had come when
we found a sheep, went on, dismounted, killed, and roasted. Of that same
roast we ate as much asafeast. After that we rode on, hurried forward, made
a five days’ journey in a day and two nights, came and entered Andijan. I
saluted my uncle the Elder Khan (and) my uncle the Younger Khan, and
made recital of past days. With the Khans I spent four months. My
servants, who had gone looking in every place, gathered themselves together ;
there were more than 300 persons. It came to my mind (kim), ‘ How long
must I wander, a vagabond (sar-gardan),1 in this Farghana country? I will
make search (¢alab) on every side (dib).’ Having said, I rode out in the
month of Muharram to seek Khurdsan, and I went out from the country of
Farghana.?

REASONS AGAINST THE REJECTION OF THE
RESCUE PASSAGE.

Two circumstances have weight against rejecting the passage,
its presence with the Haidarabad Codex and its acceptance by
Dr. Ilminsky and M. de Courteille.

That it is with the Codex is a matter needing consideration
and this the more that it is the only extra matter there found.
Not being with the Persian translations, it cannot be of early
date. It seems likely to owe its place of honour to distinguished
authorship and may well be one of the four portions (juzwe)
mentioned by Jahangir in the Tuzik-i-jahangiri,? as added by
himself to his ancestor’s book. If so, it may be mentioned, it
will have been with Babur’s autograph MS. [now not to be
found], from which the Haidarabad Codex shews signs of being
a direct copy.

[The incongruity of the Rescue passage with the true text has

been indicated by foot-notes to the translation of it already
given. What condemns it on historic and other grounds will
follow. ]

On linguistic grounds it is a strong argument in its favour
that Dr. Ilminsky and M. de Courteille should have accepted it
but the argument loses weight when some of the circumstances
of their work are taken into account.

In the first place, it is not strictly accurate to regard
Dr. Ilminsky as accepting it unquestioned, because it is
covered by his depreciatory remarks, made in his preface, on
Kehr’s text. He, like M. de Courteille, worked with a single
Turki MS. and neither of the two ever saw a complete true
text. When their source (the Kehr-Ilminsky) was able to be
collated with the Elph. and Hai. MSS. much and singular
divergence was discovered.

I venture to suggest what appears to me to explain M. de
Courteille’s acceptance of the Rescue passage. Down to its
insertion, the Kehr-Ilminsky text is so continuously and so
curiously corrupt that it seems necessary to regard it as being
a re-translation into Turki from one of the Persian translations
of the Babur-ndma. There being these textual defects in it, it
would create on the mind of a reader initiated through it, only,
in the book, an incorrect impression of Babur’s style and
vocabulary, and such a reader would feel no transition when
passing on from it to the Rescue passage.

In opposition to this explanation, it might be said that a
wrong standard set up by the corrupt text, would or could be
changed by the excellence of later parts of the Kehr-Ilminsky
one. In words, this is sound, no doubt, and such reflex crit-—
icism is now easy, but more than the one defective MS. was
wanted even to suggest the need of such reflex criticism. The
Babur-naéma is lengthy, ponderous to poise and grasp, and



--- Page 299 ---
D.—ON THE RESCUE PASSAGE xv

work on it is still tentative, even with the literary gains since
the Seventies.

Few of the grounds which weigh with us for the rejection of
the Rescue passage were known to Dr. Ilminsky or M. de
Courteille ;—the two good Codices bring each its own and
varied help; Teufel’s critique on the ‘ Fragments,’ though made
without acquaintance with those adjuncts as they stand in Kehr’s
own volume, is of much collateral value; several useful oriental
histories seem not to have been available for M. de Courteille’s
use. I may add, for my own part, that I have the great
advantage of my husband’s companionship and the guidance
of his wide acquaintance with related oriental books. In truth,
looking at the drawbacks now removed, an earlier acceptance
of the passage appears as natural as does today’s rejection.

GROUNDS FOR REJECTING THE RESCUE
PASSAGE.

The grounds for rejecting the passage need here little more
than recapitulation from my husband’s article in the JASB.
IQIO, p. 221, and are as follows ;—

i. The passage is in neither of the Waq1‘at-1-baburi.

ii. The dreams detailed are too 4 propos and marvellous. for
credence.

iii. Khwaja Yahya is not known to have had a son, named
Ya‘qub.

iv. The Babur-ndma does not contain the names assigned to
the rescuers.

vy. The Khans were not in Andijan and Babur did not go
there.

vi. He did not set out for Khurasan after spending 4 months
with The Khans but after Ahmad’s death (end of gog AH.),
while Mahmud was still in Eastern Turkistan and after about
a year’s stay in Sukh.


--- Page 300 ---
xvi APPENDICES

vii. The followers who gathered to him were not ‘more than
300’ but between 2 and 300.

vili. The ‘3 days,’ and the ‘day and two nights,’ and the
‘5 days’ journey was one of some 70 miles, and one recorded
as made in far less time.

ix. The passage is singularly inadequate to fill a gap of 14 to
16 months, during which events of the first importance occurred
to Babur and to the Chaghatai dynasty.

x. Khwaja Ahrar7s promises did nothing to fulfil Babur’s
wishes for go8 aH. while those of Ya‘qub for immediate
victory were closely followed by defeat and exile. Babur knew
the facts; the passage cannot be his. It looks as though the
writer saw Babur in Karnan across Timirid success in
Hindistan.

xi. The style and wording of the passage are not in harmony
with those of the true text.

Other reasons for rejection are marked change in choice of
the details chosen for commemoration, ¢.g. when Babur men-
tions prayer, he does so simply; when he tells a dream, it seems
areal one. The passage leaves the impression that the writer
did not think in Turki, composed in it with difficulty, and
looked at life from another view-point than Babur’s.

On these various grounds, we have come to the conclusion
that it is no part of the Babur-ndma.

[APPENDICES TO THE KABUL
SECTION. ]

E.—NAGARAHAR AND NING-NAHAR.

THOSE who consult books and maps about the riverain tract
between the Safed-koh (Spin-ghur) and (Anglicé) the Kabul-
river find its name in several forms, the most common being
Nangrahar and Nangnahar (with variant vowels). It would be
useful to establish a European book-name for the district. As
European opinion differs about the origin and meaning of the
names now in use, and as a good deal of interesting circumstance
gathers round the small problem ofa correct form (there may be
two), I offer about the matter what has come into the restricted
field of my own work, premising that I do this merely as one
who drops a casual pebble on the cairn of observation already
long rising for scholarly examination.

a. The origin and meaning of the names.

I have met with three opinions about the origin and meaning
of the names found now and earlier. To each one of them
obvious objection can be made. They are :-—

1, That all forms now in use are corruptions of the Sanscrit
word Nagarahara, the name of the Town-of-towns which in
the di-aé of the Baran-si' and Siarkh-rid left the ruins Masson
describes in Wilson’s Arzana Antiqua. But if this is so, why
is the Town-of-towns multiplied into the nine of Na-nagrahar
(Nangrahar) ??

2. That the names found represent Sanscrit zawa vthara,
nine monasteries, an opinion the Gazetteer of India of 1907 has

* Another but less obvious objection will be mentioned later.


--- Page 302 ---
xviii APPENDICES

adopted from Bellew. But why precisely nine monasteries ?
Nine appears an understatement.

3. That Nang (Ning or Nung) -nahar verbally means nine
streams, (Babur’s Tiigiiz-riid,) an interpretation of long
standing (Section 6 zzyra). But whence ang, ning, nung,
for nine? Such forms are not in Persian, Turki or Pushtu
dictionaries, and, as Sir G. A. Grierson assures me, do not
come into the Linguistic Survey.

6. On nang, ning, nung for nine.

Spite of their absence from the natural homes of words, how-
ever, the above sounds have been heard and recorded as symbols
of the number nine by careful men through a long space of time.

The following instances of the use of “Nangnahar” show this,
and also show that behind the variant forms there may be not
a single word but two of distinct origin and sense.

1. In Chinese annals two names appear as those of the
district and town (I am not able to allocate their application
with certainty). The first is Na-kie-lo-ho-lo, the second
Nang-g-lo-ho-lo and these, I understand to represent Nagara-
hara and Nang-nahar, due allowance being made for Chinese
idiosyncrasy.*

2. Some 900 years later (1527-30 AD.) Babur also gives
two names, Nagarahar (as the book-name of his ¢#man) and
Ning-nahar.2_ He says the first is found in several histories
(B.N. f. 1318) ; the second will have been what he heard and
also presumably what appeared in revenue accounts ; of it he
says, “it is nine torrents” (¢égiz-rud).

3. Some 300 years after Babur, Elphinstone gives two

t Julien notes ( Voyages des pélerins Bouddhistes, ii, 96), ‘‘ Dans les annales des
Song on trouve Nang-go-lo-ho, qui répond exactement 4 lorthographe indienne
Nangarahara, que fournit l’inscription découvert par le capitaine Kittoe” (JASB.
1848). The reference is to the Ghoswara inscription, of which Professor Kielhorn
has also written (Jzdian Antiguary, 1888), but with departure from Nangarahara to
Nagarahara. rE

2 The scribe of the Haidarabad Codex appears to have been somewhat uncertain
as to the spelling of the name. What is found in histories is plain, N:g:r: har.
The other name varies ; on first appearance (fol. 1314) and also on fols. 144 and 1546,
there is a vagrant dot below the word, which if it were above would make Ning-nahar.
In all other cases the word reads N:g:nahar. Nahar is a constant component, as is —
also the letter g (or £). {



--- Page 303 ---
E.—NAGARAHAR AND NING-NAHAR xix

names for the district, neither of them being Babur’s book-
name, “ Nangrahaur*t or Nungnahaur, from the nine streams
which issue from the Safed-koh, xwnzg in Pushtoo signifying
nine, and nahaura, a stream” (Caubul, i, 160).

4. In 1881 Colonel H. S. Tanner had heard, in Nir-valley
on the north side of the Kabul-water, that the name of the
opposite district was Ning-nahar and its meaning Nine-streams.
He did not get a list of the nine and all he heard named do
not flow from Safed-koh.

5. In 1884 Colonel H. G. McGregor gives two names with
their explanation, “ Ningrahar and Nungnihar ; the former is
a corruption of the latter word ? which in the Afghan language

signifies nine rivers or rivulets.” He names nine, but of them
six only issue from Safed-koh.

6. I have come across the following instances in which the
number nine is represented by other words than a (a7 or 2) ;
vez. the xenhan of the Chitrali Kafir and the zoun of the Panj-
abi, recorded by Leech,—the xyon of the Khowari and the
huncha of the Boorishki, recorded by Colonel Biddulph.

The above instances allow opinion that in the region concerned
and through a long period of time, nine has been expressed by
nang (ning or nung) and other nasal or high palatal sounds, side
by side with a (zz or nu). The whole matter may be one of
nasal utterance,3 but since a large number of tribesmen express
nine by a word containing a nasal sound, should that word not
find place in lists of recognized symbols of sounds?

c. Are there two names of distinct origin ?

1. Certainly it makes a well-connected story of decay in the
Sanscrit word Nagarahara to suppose that tribesmen, prone
by their organism to nasal utterance, pronounced that word

* Some writers express the view that the medial x in this word indicates descent
from Nagarahara, and that the medial of Elphinstone’s second form is a corruption
of it. Though this might be, it is true also that in local speech 7 and ~ often inter-
change, e.g. Chighar- and Chighan-sarai, Sthar and Sihan (in Nir-valley).

? This asserts 72 to be the correct consonant, and connects with the interchange of
n and r already noted.

3 Since writing the above I have seen Laidlaw’s almost identical suggestion of a
nasal interpolated in Nagarahara (JASB. 1848, art. on Kittoe). The change is of
course found elsewhere ; is not Tank for Taq an instance ?


--- Page 304 ---
XX APPENDICES

Nangrahar, and by force of their numbers made this corruption
current,—that this was recognized as the name of the town while
the Town-of-towns was great or in men’s memory, and that when
through the decay of the town its name became a meaningless
husk, the wrong meaning of the Nine-streams should enter into
possession.

But as another and better one can be put together, this fair-
seeming story may be baseless. Its substitute has the advantage
of explaining the double sequence of names shown in Section 4.

The second story makes all the variant names represent one
or other of two distinct originals. It leaves Nagrahar to represent
Nagarahara, the dead town ; it makes the nine torrents of Safed-
koh the primeval sponsors of Ning-nahar, the name of the riverain
tract. Both names, it makes contemporary in the relatively brief
interlude of the life of the town. For the fertilizing streams will
have been the dominant factors of settlement and of revenue
from the earliest times of population and government. They
arrest the eye where they and their ribbons of cultivation space
the riverain waste; they are obvious units for grouping into
a sub-government. Their name has a counterpart in adjacent
Panj-ab ; the two may have been given by one dominant power,
how long ago, in what tongue matters not. The riverain tract,
by virtue of its place on a highway of transit, must have been
inhabited long before the town Nagarahara was built, and must
have been known by a name. What better one than Nine-
streams can be thought of ?

2. Bellew is quoted by the Gazetteer of India (ed. 1907) as
saying, in his argument in favour of zawd vthara, that no nine
streams are found to stand sponsor, but modern maps shew nine
outflows from Safed-koh to the Kabul-river between the Sirkh-
riid and Daka, while if affluents to the former stream be reckoned,
more than nine issue from the range.*

Against Bellew’s view that there are not nine streams, is the

long persistence of the number nine in the popular name
(Sect. 4).

1 These affluents I omit from main consideration as sponsors because they are less
obvious units of taxable land than the direct affluents of the Kabul-river, but they
remain a reserve force of argument and may or may not have counted in Babur’s nine.



--- Page 305 ---
E.—NAGARAHAR AND NING-NAHAR xxi

It is also against his view that he supposes there were nine
monasteries, because each of the nine must have had its fertilizing
water.

Babur says there were nine ; there must have been nine of
significance; he knew his ¢#az not only by frequent transit but
by his revenue accounts. A supporting point in those accounts
is likely to have been that the individual names of the villages on
the nine streams would appear, with each its payment of revenue.

3. In this also is some weight of circumstance against taking
Nagarahara to be the parent of Ning-nahar :—An earlier name
of the town is said to be Udyanapira, Garden town.'_ Of this
Babur’s Adinapir is held to be a corruption ; the same meaning
of garden has survived on approximately the same ground in
Bala-bagh and Rozabad.

Nagarahara is seen, therefore, to be a parenthetical name
between others which are all derived from gardens. It may
shew the promotion of a “Garden-town” to a “ Chief-town”.
If it did this, there was relapse of name when the Chief-town
lost status. Was it ever applied beyond the delta? If it were,
would it, when dead in the delta, persist along the riverain tract ?
If it were not, cadit questio; the suggestion of two names
distinct in origin, is upheld.

Certainly the riverain tract would fall naturally under the
government of any town flourishing in the delta, the richest and
most populous part of the region. But for this very reason it
must have had a name older than parenthetical Nagarahdara.
That inevitable name would be appropriately Ning-nahar (or
Na-nahar) Nine-streams ; and for a period Nagarahara would be
the Chief-town of the district of Na-nahar (Nine-streams).?

d. Babur’s statements about the name.
What the cautious Babur says of his ta#man of Ning-nahar
has weight :—

1. That some histories write it Nagarahar (Haidarabad
Codex, f. 131 4);

* Cunningham, i, 42. My topic does not reach across the Kabul-river to the
greater Udyanapiira of Beal’s Buddhist Records (p. 119) nor raise the question of the
extent of that place.

? The strong form Ning-nahar is due to euphonic impulse.


--- Page 306 ---
xxii APPENDICES

2. That Ning-nahar is nine torrents, z.e. mountain strea
tuqus-rud ;
3. That (the) nine torrents issue from Safed-koh (f. 132 8).

Of his first statement can be said, that he will have seen th
book-name in histories he read, but will have heard Ning-nahar,
probably also have seen it in current letters and accounts.

Of his second,—that it bears and may be meant to bear tw
senses, (a) that the ¢éman consisted of nine torrents,—thei
lands implied ; just as he says “ Asfara is four da/iks” (sub-
divisions f. 36)—(4) that ¢aguz rid translates ning-nahar.

Of his third,—that in English its sense varies as it is rea
with or without the definite article Turki rarely writes, but th
either sense helps out his first and second, to mean that verbally
and by its constituent units Ning-nahar is nine-torrents; a
verbally and by its constituents Panj-ab is five-waters.

e. Last words.

Detailed work on the Kabul section of the Babur-nama hi
stamped two impressions so deeply on me, that they clai
mention, not as novel or as special to myself, but as set b
the work.

The first is of extreme risk in swift decision on any problem
of words arising in North Afghanistan, because of its local
concourse of tongues, the varied utterance of its unlettered tribe:
resident or nomad, and the frequent translation of proper nami
in obedience to their verbal meanings. Names lie there too i
strata, relics of successive occupation—Greek, Turki, Hind
Pushti and tribes galore.

The second is that the region is an exceptionally fruitful fiel
for first-hand observation of speech, the movent ocean of t
uttered word, free of the desiccated symbolism of alphabet
and books.

F.—ON THE NAME DARA-I-NUR.

SOME European writers have understood the name Dara-i-nir
to mean Valley of light, but natural features and also the artificial
one mentioned by Colonel H. G. Tanner (z#fra), make it better
to read the component #7, not as Persian zr, light, but. as
Pushtii m7, rock. Hence it translates as Valley of Rocks, or
Rock-valley. The region in which the valley lies is rocky and
boulder-strewn ; its own waters flow to the Kabul-river east of
the water of Chitral. It shews other names composed with zr,
in which zz suits if it means rock, but is inexplicable if it means
light, e.g. Nir-lam (Nir-fort), the master-fort in the mouth of
Nir-valley, standing high on a rock between two streams, as
Babur and Tanner have both described it from eye-witness,—
Nir-gal (village), a little to the north-west of the valley,—
Ailigh-nir (great rock), at a crossing mentioned by Babur,
higher up the Baran-water,—and Koh-i-nir (Rocky-mountains),


--- Page 308 ---

which there is ground for taking as the correct form of the
familiar “Kunar” of some European writers (Raverty’s JVodes,
p- 106). The dominant feature in these places dictates reading
nur as rock; so too the work done in Nir-valley with boulders,
of which Colonel H. G. Tanner’s interesting account is subjoined
(P.R.G.S. 1881, p. 284).

“Some 10 miles from the source of the main stream of the
Nur-valley the Dameneh stream enters, but the waters of the two
never meet ; they flow side by side about three-quarters ofa mile
apart for about 12 miles and empty themselves into the Kunar
river by different mouths, each torrent hugging closely the foot
of the hills at its own side of the valley. Now, except in countries
where terracing has been practised continuously for thousands of
years, such unnatural topography as exists in the valley of Nur
is next to impossible. The forces which were sufficient to scoop
out the valley in the first instance, would have kept a water-way
at the lowest part, into which would have poured the drainage of
the surrounding mountains; but in the Nur-valley long-continued
terracing has gradually raised the centre of the valley high above
the edges. The population has increased to its maximum limit
and every available inch of ground is required for cultivation ;
the people, by means of terrace-walls built of ponderous boulders
in the bed of the original single stream, have little by little pushed
the waters out of their true course, until they run, where now
found, in deep rocky cuttings at the foot of the hills on either
side” (p. 280).

“T should like to go on and say a good deal more about
boulders ; and while I am about it I may as well mention one
that lies back from a hamlet in Shulut, which is so big that
a house is built in a fault or crack running across its face.
Another pebble lies athwart the village and covers the whole of
the houses from that side.”

G.—ON THE NAMES OF TWO DARA-I-NUR WINES xxv

G.—ON THE NAMES OF TWO DARA-I-NUR
WINES.

From the two names, Arat-tashi and Sihan (Suhar) -tashi,
which Babur gives as those of two wines of the Dara-i-nir, it
can be inferred that he read z#r to mean rock. For if in them
Turki ¢ash, rock, be replaced by Pushtii xiv, rock, two place-
names emerge, Arat (-niri) and Sihan (-niri), known in the
Nir-valley.

These may be villages where the wines were grown, but it
would be quite exceptional for Babur to say that wines are called

from their villages, or indeed by any name. He says here not
where they grow but what they are called.

I surmise that he is repeating a joke, perhaps his own, perhaps
a standing local one, made on the quality of the wines. For
whether with ¢@sh or with dr (rock), the names can be translated
as Rock-saw and Rock-file, and may refer to the rough and acid
quality of the wines, rasping and setting the teeth on edge as
does iron on stone.

The villages themselves may owe their names to a serrated
edge or splintered pinnacle of weathered granite, in which local
people, known as good craftsmen, have seen resemblance to tools
of their trade. :

H—ON THE COUNTERMARK BIH BUD
ON COINS.

AS coins of Sl. Husain Mirza Bai-gara and other rulers do
actually bear the words Bzh bid, Babur’s statement that the


--- Page 310 ---
XXVi APPENDICES

name of Bihbid Beg was on the Mirza’s coins acquires a
numismatic interest which may make serviceable the followi
particulars concerning the passage and the beg.

a. The Turki passage (Elph. MS. f. 1356; Haidarabad Codex
f. 1736; Ilminsky p. 217).

For ease of reference the Turki, Persian and English versio
are subjoined :—

(1) Yana Bihbid me aidi. Biurtinlar chuhra-jirga-si-da
khidmat gilir aidi. Mirza-ning gasagliglarida khidmati bagib
Bihbid Beg-ka bi ‘inayatni giltbh aidi kim tamgha u sikka-
aning ati aidi.

(2) The Persian translation of ‘Abdu’r-rahim (Muh. Shirazi’s
lith. ed. p. 110) :—

Digar Bihbiid Beg bid. Auwalha dar jsirga-t-chuhraha
khidmat mtkard. Chin dar qgazagiha Mirzara khidmat kar
bid u anra mulahaza namida, ainra ‘inayat karda bid kah da
tamghanat stkka? nam-t-au bid.

(3) A literal English translation of the Turki :— 3

Another was Bihbid Beg. He served formerly in the chuhra-
jirga-si (corps of braves). Looking to his service in the Mirza’s
guerilla-times, the favour had been done to Bihbiid Beg that his
name was on the stamp and coin.3

b. Of Bihbiid Beg.

We have found little so far to add to what Babur tells
Bihbid Beg and what he tells we have not found elsewhe
The likely sources of his information are Daulat Shah an
Khwand-amir who have written at length of Husain Baz-gara.
Considerable search in the books of both men has failed to
discover mention of signal service or public honour connect
with the beg. Babur may have heard what he tells in Hara
in 912 AH. (1506 AD.) when he would see Husain’s coins

* Some discussion about these coins has already appeared in JRAS. 1913 and 1914
from Dr. Codrington, Mr. M. Longworth Dames and my husband.

? This variant from the Turki may be significant. Should samghdnat(-2-)stkka be
read and does this describe countermarking ?

3 It will be observed that Babur does not explicitly say that Husain put the beg’s
name on the coin.


--- Page 311 ---
H.—ON THE COUNTERMARK BIH BUD ON COINS xxvii

presumably ; but later opportunity to see them must have been
frequent during his campaigns and visits north of Hindi-kush,
notably in Balkh.

The sole mention we have found of Bihbid Beg in the
Flabibu's-styar is that he was one of Husain’s commanders at
the battle of Chikman-sarai which was fought with Sl. Mahmiid
Mirza Miranshahi in Muharram 876 AH. (June-July 1471 AD.).
His place in the list shews him to have had importance.
“Amir Nizamu’d-din ‘Ali-sher’s brother Darwesh-i-‘ali_ the
librarian (g.v. Hai. Codex Index), and Amir Bihbiad, and Muh.
‘Ali ataka, and Bakhshika, and Shah Wali Qépchdg, and Dost-i-
muhammad chuhra, and Amir Qul-i-‘ali, and” (another).

The total of our information about the man is therefore :—

(1) That when Husain? from 861 to 873 AH. (1457 to
1469 AD.) was fighting his way up to the throne of Harat,
Bihbid served him well in the corps of braves, (as many others
will have done).

(2) That he was a beg and one of Husain’s commanders in
876 AH. (1471 AD.).

(3) That Babur includes him amongst Husain’s begs and
says of him what has been quoted, doing this circa 934 AH.
(1528 AD.), some 56 years after Khwand-amir’s mention of him
s.a, 876 AH. (1471 AD.).

6. Of the term chuhra-jirga-si used by Babur.

Of this term Babur supplies an explicit explanation which
I have not found in European writings. His own book amply
exemplifies his explanation, as do also Khwand-amir’s and
Haidar’s.

He gives the explanation (f. 154) when describing a retainer
of his father’s who afterwards became one of his own begs. It is
as follows :—

““Ali-darwesh of Khurasan served in the Khurasan chuhra-
Jirga-si, one of two special corps (khasa ¢abin) of serviceable
braves (yarar yigitlar) formed by Sl. Abi-sa‘id Mirza when

* Husain born 842 AH. (1438 AD.) ; d. 911 AH. (1506 AD.).

XXVili APPENDICES

he first began to arrange the government of Khuradsan and
Samarkand and, presumably, called by him the Khurasan co’
and the Samarkand corps.”

This shews the circle to have consisted of fighting-men, such
serviceable braves as are frequently mentioned by Babur; and
his words “yarar yigit” make it safe to say that if instead of
using a Persian phrase, he had used a Turki one, yégi¢, brave
would have replaced chuhra, “young soldier” (Erskine). A con-
siderable number of men on active service are styled chuhra,
one at least is styled yizgit, in the same way as others are
styled deg.*

Three military circles are mentioned in the Babur-nama,
consisting respectively of braves, household begs (under Babur’s
own command), and great begs. Some men are mentioned who
never rose from the rank of brave (yzgit), some who became
household-begs, some who went through the three grades.

Of the corps of braves Babur conveys the information that
Abi-sa‘id founded it at a date which will have lain between
1451 and 1457 AD.; that ‘Umar Shaikh’s man ‘Ali-darwesh
belonged to it; and that Husain’s man Bihbid did so also.
Both men, ‘Ali-darwesh and Bihbid, when in its circle, would
appropriately be styled chwhra as men of the beg-circle were
styled beg; the Dost-i-muhammad chuhra who was a com-
mander, (he will have had a brave’s command,) at Chikman-sarai
(see list supra) will also have been of this circle. Instances of the
use by Babur of the name khasa-tabin and its equivalent baz
tikini are shewn on f. 209 and f. 2104. A considerable number
of Babur’s fighting men, the braves he so frequently mentions as
sent on service, are styled chuhra and inferentially belong to
the same circle.?

* Cf. f. 76 note to braves (yigitiar). There may be instances, in the earlier
Farghana section where I have translated chuhra wrongly by page. My attention
had not then been fixed on the passage about the coins, nor had I the same
familiarity with the Kabul section. For a household page to be clearly recognizable
as such from the context, is rare—other uses of the word are translated as their
context dictates.

? They can be traced through my Index and in some cases their careers followed.
Since I translated chuhra-yjirga-si on f. 156 by cadet-corps, I have found in the Kabul
section instances of long service in the corps which make the word cadet, as it is used
in English, too young a name.

ad. Of Bth bid on Husain Bai-gara’s coins.

So far it does not seem safe to accept Babur’s statement
literally. He may tell a half-truth and obscure the rest by his
brevity.

Nothing in the sources shows ground for signal and public
honour to Bihbiid Beg, but a good deal would allow surmise
that jesting allusion to his name might decide for Bzk did as
a coin mark when choice had to be made of one, in the flush of
success, in an assembly of the begs, and, amongst those begs,
lovers of word-play and enigma.

The personal name is found written Bihbiid, as one word and
with medial Z; the mark is Bzh dad with the terminal % in the
Bih. There have been discussions moreover as to whether to
read on the coins zh bid, it was good, or Bzk buvad, \et it be,
or become, good (valid for currency ?).

The question presents itself; would the beg’s name have
appeared on the coins, if it had not coincided in form with a
suitable coin-mark ?

Against literal acceptance of Babur’s statement there is also
doubt of a thing at once so dex trovato and so unsupported by
evidence.

Another doubt arises from finding Bzhk dad on coins of other
rulers, one of Iskandar Khan’s being of a later date,’ others, of
Timir, Shahrukh and Abi-sa‘id, with nothing to shew who ©
counterstruck it on them.

On some of Husain’s coins the sentence 27h did appears as
part of the legend and not as a counterstrike. This is a good
basis for finding a half-truth in Babur’s statement. It does not
allow of a whole-truth in his statement because, as it is written,
it is a coin-mark, not a name.

An interesting matter as bearing on Husain’s use of Bzh bad
is that in 865 AH. (1461 AD.) he had an incomparable horse
named Bihbid, one he gave in return for a falcon on making
peace with Mustapha Khan.”

* This Mr. M. Longworth Dames pointed out in JRAS. 1913.

Husain’s coins given in this appendix I am indebted to Dr. Codrington and

e. Of Babur's vassal-coinage.

The following historical details narrow the field of numismatic
observation on coins believed struck by Babur as a vassal of
Isma‘ll Safawz. They are offered because not readily accessible.

The length of Babur’s second term of rule in Transoxiana
was not the three solar years of the B.M. Coin Catalogues but
did not exceed eight months. He entered Samarkand in the
middle of Rajab 917 AH. (c. Oct. Ist, 1511 AD.). He returned
to it defeated and fled at once, after the battle of Kil-i-malik
which was fought in Safar 918 AH. (mid-April to mid-May
1512 AD.). Previous to the entry he was in the field, without
a fixed base; after his flight he was landless till at the end
both of 920 AH. and of 1514 AD. he had returned to Kabul.

He would not find a full Treasury in Samarkand because the
Aiizbegs evacuated the fort at their own time; eight months
would not give him large tribute in kind. He failed in Trans-
oxiana because he was the ally of a Shi‘a ; would coins bearing
the Shi‘a legend have passed current from a Samarkand mint?
These various circumstances suggest that he could not have
struck many coins of any kind in Samarkand.

The coins classed in the B.M. Catalogues as of Babur’s
vassalage, offer a point of difficulty to readers of his own
writings, inasmuch as neither the “Sultan Muhammad” of
No. 652 (gold), nor the “ Sultan Babur Bahadur” of the silver
coins enables confident acceptance of them as names he himself
would use.

I.—ON THE WEEPING-WILLOWS OF f. 1900.

THE passage omitted from f. 190d, which seems to describe some
thing decorative done with weeping willows, (4ed-¢-mawallah)
has been difficult to all translators. This may be due to in-
accurate pointing in Babur’s original MS. or may be what a
traveller seeing other willows at another feast could explain.



--- Page 315 ---
I.—ON THE WEEPING WILLOWS OF f. 1905 XXX?

The first Persian translation omits the passage (I.O. 215
f. 1546) ; the second varies from the Turki, notably by changing
sach and saj to shakh throughout (1.0. 217 f. 1500). The English
and French translations differ much (lemozrs p. 206, Mémozres
i, 414), the latter taking the szawallah to be mila, a hut, against
which much is clear in the various MSS.

Three Turki sources * agree in reading as follows :—

Mawallahlar-ni (or muwallah Uai. MS.) kiltirdilar. Bilman
sachlari-ning ya ‘amli sachlari-ning aralarigha k:msan-ni
(Iiminsky, kaman) shakh-ning (Hai. MS. sakh) aitzinlighi bila
ainjiga ainjiga kisib, quiab turlar.

The English and French translations differ from the Turki
and from one another :—

(Memoirs, p. 206) They brought in branching willow-trees.
I do not know if they were in the natural state of the tree, or if
the branches were formed artificially, but they had small twigs
cut the length of the ears of a bow and inserted between them.

(Mémoires i, 434) On faconna des huttes (soulch). Ils les
établissent en taillant des baguettes minces, de la longeur du
bout recourbé de I’arc, qu’on place entre des branches naturelles
ou fagonnées artificiellement, je l’ignore.

The construction of the sentence appears to be thus :—/awal-
lahlar-ni kiltirdilar, they brought weeping-willows ; & : msan-ni
guiubtirlar, they had put k:msdn-ni; ainjiga ainjiga kisib,
cut very fine (or slender); shakh (or sakh)-ning aiizinlighi, of the
length of a shakh, bow, or sakh . . .; bilman sachlari-ning ya‘amli
Sachlari-ning aralirigha, to (or at) the spaces of the sachlar
whether their (z.e. the willows’) own or artificial sdchlar.

These translations clearly indicate felt difficulty. Mr. Erskine
does not seem to have understood that the trees were Salix
babylonica. The crux of the passage is the word & : msan-ni,
which tells what was placed in the spaces. It has been read as
kaman, bow, by all but the scribes of the two good Turki MSS.
and asin a phrase horn of a bow. This however is not allowed
by the Turki, for the reason that % : msan-ni is not in the genitive
but in the accusative case. (I may say that Babur does not use
ni for ning ; he keeps strictly to the prime uses of each enclitic,

* Elphinstone MS. f. 1505 ; Haidarabad MS. f. 1906; Ilminsky, imprint p. 241.


--- Page 316 ---
Xxxil APPENDICES

ni accusative, zing genitive.) Moreover, if & :msdn-ni be taken
as a genitive, the verbs g#z#b-turlar and kistb have no object, no
other accusative appearing in the sentence than & : msan-ni.

A weighty reason against changing sach into shakh is that
Dr. Ilminsky has not done so. He must have attached meaning
to sa@ch since he uses it throughout the passage. He was nearer
the region wherein the original willows were seen at a feast.
Unfortunately nothing shows how he interpreted the word.

Sachmag is a tassel; is it also a catkin and were there
decorations, kzmsan-ni (things kimsa, or flowers Ar. #im, or
something shining, £zmcha, gold brocade) hung in between the
catkins ?

Ilminsky writes 2’lah (with hamza) and this de Courteille
translates by hut. The Hai. MS. writes muwallah (marking
the gamma).

In favour of reading mawallah (mulah) as a tree and that tree
Salix babylonica the weeping-willow, there are annotations in the
Second Persian translation and, perhaps following it, in the
Elphinstone MS. of xam-z-dirakht, name of a tree, didan-t-bed,
sight of the willow, ded-2-mawallah, mournful-willow. Standing
alone mawallah means weeping-willow, in this use answering to
majnin the name Panj-abis give the tree, from Leila’s lover the
distracted ze. Majniin (Brandis).

The whole question may be solved by a chance remark from
a traveller witnessing similar festive decoration at another feast
in that conservative region.

J.—ON BABURS EXCAVATED CHAMBER
AT QANDAHAR (f. 208d).
SINCE making my note (f. 2084) on the wording of the passage

in which Babur mentions excavation done by him at Qandahar,
I have learned that he must be speaking of the vaulted chamber



--- Page 317 ---
J._BABUR’S EXCAVATED CHAMBER AT QANDAHAR xxxiii

containing the celebrated inscriptions about which much has
been written."

The primary inscription, the one commemorating Babur's
final possession of Qandahar, gives the chamber the character of
a Temple of Victory and speaks of it as Rawdg-t-jahan namai,
World-shewing-portal,? doubtless because of its conspicuous
position and its extensive view, probably also in allusion to its
declaration of victory. Mir Ma‘siim writes of it as a Pesh-taq,
frontal arch, which, coupled with Mohan Lall’s word arch (aq)
suggests that the chamber was entered through an arch pierced
in a parallelogram smoothed on the rock and having resemblance
to the fesh-tag of buildings, a suggestion seeming the more
probable that some inscriptions are on the “wings” of the arch.
But by neither of the above-mentioned names do Mohan Lall
and later travellers call the chamber or write of the place ; all
describe it by its approach of forty steps, Chihil-zina.3

The excavation has been chipped out of the white-veined
limestone of the bare ridge on and below which stood Old
Qandahar.3 It does not appear from the descriptions to have
been on the summit of the ridge; Bellew says that the forty
steps start half-way up the height. I have found no estimate
of the height of the ridge, or statement that the steps end at the
chamber. The ridge however seems to have been of noticeably
dominating height. It rises steeply to the north and there ends
in the naze of which Babur writes. The foot of the steps is
guarded by two towers. Mohan Lall, unaccustomed to mountains,
found their ascent steep and dizzy. The excavated chamber of
the inscriptions, which Bellew describes as “bow-shaped and
dome-roofed ”, he estimated as 12 feet at the highest point,

* Muh. Ma‘sim Bhakkart’s Tarikh-z-sind 1600, Malet’s Trs. 1855, p. 89; Mohan
Lall’s Journal 1834, p. 279 and Travels 1846, p. 311; Bellew’s Polztical Mission to
Afghanistan 1857, p. 232 ; Journal Asiatique 1890, Darmesteter’s La grande inscrip-
tion de Qandahar; JRAS. 1898, Beames’ Geography of the Qandahar inscription.
Murray’s Hand-book of the Panjab etc. 1883 has an account which as to the Inscrip-
tions shares in the inaccuracies of its sources (Bellew & Lumsden).

? The plan of Qandahar given in the official account of the Second Afghan War,
makes Chihil-zina appear on the wrong side of the ridge, n.w. instead of n.e.

3 destroyed in 1714 aD. It lay 3m. west of the present Qandahar (not its
immediate successor). It must be observed that Darmesteter’s insufficient help in
plans and maps led him to identify Chihil-zina with Chihil-dukhtaran (Forty-
daughters).

XXxiv APPENDICES

12 feet deep and 8 feet wide. Two sculptured beasts guard the
entrance; Bellew calls them leopards but tigers would better
symbolize the watch and ward of the Tiger Babur. In truth
the whole work, weary steps of approach, tiger guardians, com-
memorative chamber, laboriously incised words, are admirably
symbolic of his long-sustained resolve and action, taken always
with Hindustan as the goal.

There are several inscriptions of varying date, within and
without the chamber. Mohan Lall saw and copied them ;
Darmesteter worked on a copy; the two English observers
Lumsden and Bellew made no attempt at correct interpretation.
In the versions all give there are inaccuracies, arising from
obvious causes, especially from want of historical data. The last
word has not been said ; revision awaits photography and the
leisured expert. A part of the needed revision has been done
by Beames, who deals with the geography of what Mir Ma‘sim
himself added under Akbar after he had gone as Governor to
Qandahar in 1007 AH. (1598 AD.). This commemorates not
Babur’s but Akbar’s century of cities.

It is the primary inscription only which concerns this Appendix.
This is one in relief in the dome of the chamber, recording in
florid Persian that Abi’l-ghazi Babur took possession of Qandahar
on Shawwal 13th 928 AH. (Sep. Ist 1522 AD.), that in the same
year he commanded the construction of this Rawdag-2-jahan-
nama, and that the work had been completed by his son Kamran
at the time he made over charge of Qandahar to his brothe
‘Askari in 9 .. (mutilated). After this the gravure changes in
character.

In the above, Babur’s title Abi’l-ghazi fixes the date of the
inscription as later than the battle of Kanwaha (f. 3240), because
it was assumed in consequence of this victory over a Hindi, in
March 1527 (Jumada II 933 AH.).

The mutilated date 9.. is given by Mohan Lall as 952 AH.
but this does not suit several circumstances, eg. it puts com
pletion too far beyond the time mentioned as consumed by th
work, nine years,—and it was not that at which Kamran mad
over charge to ‘Askari, but followed the expulsion of both full-
brothers from Qandahar by their half-brother Humayin.



--- Page 319 ---
J.—BABUR’S EXCAVATED CHAMBER AT QANDAHAR  xxxv

The mutilated date 9.. is given by Darmesteter as 933 AH.
but this again does not fit the historical circumstance that
Kamran was in Qandahar after that date and till 937 AH. This
date (937 AH.) we suggest as fitting to replace the lost figures,
(1) because in that year and after his father’s death, Kamran
gave the town to ‘Askari and went himself to Hindiistan, and
(2) because work begun in 928 AH. and recorded as occupying
70-80 men for nine years would be complete in 937 AH... The
inscription would be one of the last items of the work.

The following matters are added here because indirectly con-
nected with what has been said and because not readily accessible.

a. Birth of Kamran.

Kamran’s birth falling in a year of one of the Babur-nama
gaps, is nowhere mentioned. It can be closely inferred as 914
Or 915 AH. from the circumstances that he was younger than
Humayin born late in 913 AH., that it is not mentioned in the
fragment of the annals of 914 AH., and that he was one of the
children enumerated by Gul-badan as going with her father to
Samarkand in 916 AH. (Probably the children did not start
with their father in the depth of winter across the mountains.)
Possibly the joyful name Kamran is linked to the happy issue
of the Mughil rebellion of 914 AH. Kamran would thus be
about 18 when left in charge of Kabul and Qandahar by Babur
in 932 AH. before the start for the fifth expedition to Hindistan.

A letter from Babur to Kamran in Qandahar is with Kehr’s
Latin version of the Babur-nama, in Latin and entered on the

despatch of Ibrahim Lédz’s son to Kamran’s charge, to date
somewhere close to Jan. 3rd 1527 (Rabi‘u’l-awwal 29th 933 AH.)

K.—AN AFGHAN LEGEND.

My husband’s article in the Asiatic Quarterly Review of
April 1901 begins with an account of the two MSS. from which
it is drawn, vzz. I.O. 581 in Pushti, I.O. 582 in Persian. Both
are mainly occupied with an account of the Yisuf-zai. The
second opens by telling of the power of the tribe in Afghanistan
and of the kindness of Malik Shah Sulaiman, one of their chiefs,
to Ailigh Beg Mirza K@éulz, (Babur’s paternal uncle,) when he
was young and in trouble, presumably as a boy ruler.

It relates that one day a wise man of the tribe, Shaikh
‘Usman saw Sulaiman sitting with the young Mirza on his knee
and warned him that the boy had the eyes of Yazid and would
destroy him and his family as Yazid had destroyed that of the
Prophet. Sulaiman paid him no attention and gave the Mirza
his daughter in marriage. Subsequently the Mirza having
invited the Yisuf-zai to Kabul, treacherously killed Sulaiman
and 700 of his followers. They were killed at the place called
Siyah-sang near Kabul ; it is still known, writes the chronicler
in about 1770 AD. (1184 AH.), as the Grave of the Martyrs.
Their tombs are revered and that of Shaikh ‘Usman in
particular.

Shah Sulaiman was the eldest of the seven sons of Malik
Taju’d-din ; the second was Sultan Shah, the father of Malik
Ahmad. Before Sulaiman was killed he made three requests



--- Page 321 ---
K.—AN AFGHAN LEGEND Xxxvii

of Auligh Beg; one of them was that his nephew Ahmad’s
life might be spared. This was granted.

Ailigh Beg died (after ruling from 865 to 907 AH.), and
Babur defeated his son-in-law and successor M. Muqim (Arghin,
gio AH.). Meantime the Yisuf-zai had migrated to Pashawar
but later on took Sawad from Sl. Wais (Hai. Codex ff. 219,
2206, 221).

When Babur came to rule in Kabul, he at first professed
friendship for the Yisuf-zai but became prejudiced against
them through their enemies the Dilazik* who gave force to
their charges by a promised subsidy of 70,000 shahrukhi.
Babur therefore determined, says the Yisuf-zai chronicler, to
kill Malik ? Ahmad and so wrote him a friendly invitation to
Kabul. Ahmad agreed to go, and set out with four brothers
who were famous musicians. Meanwhile the Dilazak had
persuaded Babur to put Ahmad to death at once, for they said
Ahmad was so clever and eloquent that if allowed to speak, he
would induce the Padshah to pardon him.

On Ahmad’s arrival in Kabul, he is said to have learned that
Babur’s real object was his death. His companions wanted to
tie their turbans together and let him down over the wall of the
fort, but he rejected their proposal as too dangerous for him and
them, and resolved to await his fate. He told his companions
however, except one of the musicians, to go into hiding in
the town.

Next morning there was a great assembly and Babur sat on
the dais-throne. Ahmad made his reverence on entering but
Babur’s only acknowledgment was to make bow and arrow
ready to shoot him. When Ahmad saw that Babur’s intention
was to shoot him down without allowing him to speak, he
unbuttoned his jerkin and stood still before the Padshah.
Babur, astonished, relaxed the tension of his bow and asked
Ahmad what he meant. Ahmad’s only reply was to tell the
Padshah not to question him but to do what he intended.
Babur again asked his meaning and again got the same reply.

* Hai. Codex, Index svzz.
2 It is needless to say that a good deal in this story may be merely fear and
supposition accepted as occurrence.

XXXVIil APPENDICES

Babur put the same question a third time, adding that he could
not dispose of the matter without knowing more. Then Ahmad
opened the mouth of praise, expatiated on Babur’s excellencies
and said that in this great assemblage many of his subjects
were looking on to see the shooting ; that his jerkin being very
thick, the arrow might not pierce it; the shot might fail and
the spectators blame the Padshah for missing his mark ; for
these reasons he had thought it best to bare his breast. Babur
was so pleased by this reply that he resolved to pardon Ahmad
at once, and laid down his bow.

Said he to Ahmad, “What sort of man is Buhlil Zaz?”
“ A giver of horses,” said Ahmad.

“ And of what sort his son Sikandar?” “A giver of robes.”

“And of what sort is Babur?” “He,” said Ahmad, “is
a giver of heads.”

“Then,” rejoined Babur, “I give you yours.”

The Padshah now became quite friendly with Ahmad, came
down from his throne, took him by the hand and led him into
another room where they drank together. Three times did
Babur have his cup filled, and after drinking a portion, give the
rest to Ahmad. At length the wine mounted to Babur’s head ;
he grew merry and began to dance. Meantime Ahmad’s
musician played and Ahmad who knew Persian well, poured
out an eloquent harangue. When Babur had danced for some
time, he held out his hands to Ahmad for a reward (dakhshish),
saying, “I am your performer.” Three times did he open his
hands, and thrice did Ahmad, with a profound reverence, drop
a gold coin into them. Babur took the coins, each time placing
his hand on his head. He then took off his robe and gave it to
Ahmad; Ahmad took off his own coat, gave it to Adu the
musician, and put on what the Padshah had given.

Ahmad returned safe to his tribe. He declined a second
invitation to Kabul, and sent in his stead his brother Shah
Mansitr. Mansi received speedy dismissal as Babur was dis-—
pleased at Ahmad’s not coming. On his return to his tribe
Mansiir advised them to retire to the mountains and make
a strong sangur. This they did; as foretold, Babur came into
their country with a large army. He devastated their lands

i

K.—AN AFGHAN LEGEND XXXIX

but could make no impression on their fort. In order the
better to judge of its character, he, as was his wont, disguised
himself as a Qalandar, and went with friends one dark night to
the Mahia hill where the stronghold was, a day’s journey
from the Padshah’s camp at Diarin.

It was the ‘Id-i-qurban and there was a great assembly and
feasting at Shah Mansir’s house, at the back of the Mahira-
mountain, still known as Shah Mansir’s throne. Babur went
in his disguise to the back of the house and stood among the
crowd in the courtyard. He asked servants as they went to
and fro about Shah Mansir’s family and whether he had
a daughter. They gave him straightforward answers.

At the time Musammat Bibi Mubaraka, Shah Mansur’s
daughter was sitting with other women ina tent. Her eye fell
on the qalandars and she sent a servant to Babur with some
cooked meat folded between two loaves. Babur asked who had
sent it; the servant said it was Shah Mansir’s daughter Bibi
Mubaraka. “Where is she?” “That is she, sitting in front
of you in the tent.” Babur Padshah became entranced with
her beauty and asked the woman-servant, what was her dis-
position and her age and whether she was betrothed. The
servant replied by extolling her mistress, saying that her virtue
equalled her beauty, that she was pious and brimful of rectitude
and placidity ; also that she was not betrothed. Babur then
left with his friends, and behind the house hid between two
stones the food that had been sent to him.

He returned to camp in perplexity as to what to do; he saw
he could not take the fort ; he was ashamed to return to Kabul
with nothing effected ; moreover he was in the fetters of love.
He therefore wrote in friendly fashion to Malik Ahmad and
asked for the daughter of Shah Mansir, son of Shah Sulaiman.
Great objection was made and earlier misfortunes accruing to
Yiisuf-zai chiefs who had given daughters to Ailigh Beg and
SI. Wais (Khan Mirza?) were quoted. They even said they
had no daughter to give. Babur replied with a “ beautiful”
royal letter, told of his visit disguised to Shah Mansiir’s house,
of his seeing Bibi Mubaraka and as token of the truth of his
story, asked them to search for the food he had hidden. They


--- Page 324 ---
xl APPENDICES

searched and found. Ahmad and Mansir were still averse, but
the tribesmen urged that as before they had always made
sacrifice for the tribe so should they do now, for by giving the
daughter in marriage, they would save the tribe from Babur’s
anger. The Maliks then said that it should be done “for the
good of the tribe”.

When their consent was made known to Babur, the drums of
joy were beaten and preparations were made for the marriage ;
presents were sent to the bride, a sword of his also, and the two
Maliks started out to escort her. They are said to have come
from Thana by M‘amiira (?), crossed the river at Chakdara,
taken a narrow road between two hills and past Talash-village
to the back of Tiri(?) where the Padshah’s escort met them.
The Maliks returned, spent one night at Chakdara and next
morning reached their homes at the Mahiira saxgur.

Meanwhile Runa the nurse who had control of Malik Mansir’s
household, with two other nurses and many male and female
servants, went on with Bibi Mubaraka to the royal camp. The
bride was set down with all honour at a large tent in the middle
of the camp.

That night and on the following day the wives of the officers
came to visit her but she paid them no attention. So, they
said to one another as they were returning to their tents, “ Her
beauty is beyond question, but she has shewn us no kindness,
and has not spoken to us ; we do not know what mystery there
is about her.”

Now Bibi Mubaraka had charged her servants to let her know
when the Padshah was approaching in order that she might
receive him according to Malik Ahmad’s instructions. They
said to her, “ That was the pomp just now of the Padshah’s going
to prayers at the general mosque.” That same day after the
Mid-day Prayer, the Padshah went towards her tent. Her
servants informed her, she immediately left her divan and
advancing, lighted up the carpet by her presence, and stood
respectfully with folded hands. When the Padshah entered, she
bowed herself before him. But her face remained entirely
covered. At length the Padshah seated himself on the divan
and said to her, “Come Afghaniya, be seated.” Again she



--- Page 325 ---
K.—AN AFGHAN LEGEND sli

bowed before him, and stood as before. A second time he said,
“ Afghaniya, be seated.” Again she prostrated herself before
him and came a little nearer, but still stood. Then the Padshah
pulled the veil from her face and beheld incomparable beauty.
He was entranced, he said again, “O, Afghaniya, sit down.”
Then she bowed herself again, and said, “I have a petition to
make. If an order be given, I will make it.” The Padshah
said kindly, “Speak.” Whereupon she with both hands took
up her dress and said, “ Think that the whole Yisuf-zai tribe is
enfolded in my skirt, and pardon their offences for my sake.”
Said the Padshah, “I forgive the Yiisuf-zai all their offences in
thy presence, and cast them all into thy skirt. Hereafter I shall
have no ill-feeling to the Yisuf-zai.”. Again she bowed before
him ; the Padshah took her hand and led her to the divan.

When the Afternoon Prayer time came and the Padshah rose
from the divan to go to prayers, Bibi Mubaraka jumped up and
fetched him his shoes.t He put them on and said very pleasantly,
“T am extremely pleased with you and your tribe and I have
_ pardoned them all for your sake.” Then he said with a smile,
“We know it was Malik Ahmad taught you all these ways.”
He then went to prayers and the Bibi remained to say hers in
the tent.

After some days the camp moved from Diariin and proceeded
by Bajaur and Tanki to Kabul.” .. .

Bibi Mubaraka, the Blessed Lady, is often mentioned by
Gul-badan ; she had no children; and lived an honoured life,
as her chronicler says, until the beginning of Akbar’s reign,
_ when she died. Her brother Mir Jamal rose to honour under
Babur, Humayiin and Akbar.

L.—ON MAHIM’S ADOPTION OF HIND-AL.

THE passage quoted below about Mahim’s adoption of the
unborn Hind-al we have found so far only in Kehr’s transcript
of the Babur-nama (ze. the St.Petersburg Foreign Office Codex).
Ilminsky reproduced it (Kasan imprint p. 281) and de Courteille
translated it (ii, 45), both with endeavour at emendation. It is
interpolated in Kehr’s MS. at the wrong place, thus indicating
that it was once marginal or apart from the text.

I incline to suppose the whole a note made by Humayin,
although part of it might be an explanation made by Babur, at
a later date, of an over-brief passage in his diary. Of such
passages there are several instances. What is strongly against
its being Babur’s where otherwise it might be his, is that Mahim,
as he always calls her simply, is there written of as Hazrat
Walida, Royal Mother and with the honorific plural. That
plural Babur uses for his own mother (dead 14 years before
925 AH.) and never for Mahim. The note is as follows :—

“The explanation is this :—As up to that time those of one
birth (¢éiggan, womb) with him (Humayin), that is to say a son
Bar-bil, who was younger than he but older than the rest, and
three daughters, Mihr-jan and two others, died in childhood, he
had a great wish for one of the same birth with him.’ I had
said ‘What it would have been if there had been one of the
same birth with him!’ (Humayiin). Said the Royal Mother,
‘If Dil-dar Aghacha bear a son, how is it if I take him and rear
him?’ ‘It is very good’ said I.”

So far doubtfully mzght be Babur’s but it may be Humayiin’s
written as a note for Babur. What follows appears to be by
some-one who knew the details of Mahim’s household talk and
was in Kabul when Dil-dar’s child was taken from her.

“Seemingly women have the custom of taking omens in the
following way :—When they have said, ‘Is it to be a boy? is it

« 2.¢. Humiayiin wished for a full-brother or sister, another child in the house with

him. The above names of his brother and sister are given elsewhere only by Gul-
badan (f. 64).

to be a girl ?’ they write ‘Ali or Hasan on one of two pieces of
paper and Fatima on the other, put each paper into a ball of
clay and throw both into a bowl of water. Whichever opens
first is taken as an omen; if the man’s, they say a man-child
will be born ; if the woman’s, a girl will be born. They took
the omen ; it came out a man.”

“On this glad tidings we at once sent letters off.t A few
days later God’s mercy bestowed a son. Three days before the
news? and three days after the birth, they 3 took the child from
its mother, (she) willy-nilly, brought it to our house 4 and took
it in their charge. When we sent the news of the birth, Bhira
was being taken. They named him Hind-al for a good omen
and benediction.” 5

The whole may be Humayiin’s, and prompted by a wish to
“remove an obscurity his father had left and by sentiment stirred
through reminiscence of a cherished childhood.

Whether Humayin wrote the whole or not, how is it that the
passage appears only in the Russian group of Baburiana ?

An apparent answer to this lies in the following little mosaic
of circumstances :—The St. Petersburg group of Baburiana ® is
linked to Kamran’s own copy of the Babur-nama by having
with it a letter of Babur to Kamran and also what may be a note
indicating its passage into Humayiin’s hands (JRAS 1908
p.830). If it did so pass, a note by Humayiin may have become
associated with it, in one of several obvious ways. This would
be at a date earlier than that of the Elphinstone MS. and would
explain why it is found in Russia and not in Indian MSS.”

t The ‘‘ we” might be Mahim and Humayin, to Babur in camp.

SECTION. ]

M.—ON THE TERM BAHRI QUTAS.

THAT the term dahri giitds is interpreted by Meninski, Erskine,
and de Courteille in senses so widely differing as eguus mart-
timus, mountain-cow, and de@uf vert de mer is due, no doubt, to
| their writing when the gids, the yak, was less well known than
it now is.
| The word gitds represents both the yak itself and its neck-
_ tassel and tail. Hence Meninski explains it by nodus fim-
| briatus ex cauda seu crinibus equi maritimi. His “sea-horse”
| appears to render éahri gitas, and is explicable by the circum-
stance that the same purposes are served by horse-tails and by
yak-tails and tassels, namely, with both, standards are fashioned,
horse-equipage is ornamented or perhaps furnished with fly-
flappers, and the ordinary hand-fly-flappers are made, ze. the
_ chowries of Anglo-India.
Erskine’s “mountain-cow” (AZemozrs p.317) may well be due
to his wwushi’s giving the yak an alternative name, vez. Kosh-
; gau (Vigne) or Khash-gau (Ney Elias), which appears to mean
mountain-cow (cattle, oxen).!
De Courteille’s Dictionary p.422, explains gatas (giitas) as bauf
marin (bahri giitas) and his Mémotres ii, 191, renders Babutr’s
| bahri qiitas by beuf vert de mer (f.276, p.490 and n.8).
The term Jahri qiitas could be interpreted with more confidence
if one knew where the seemingly Arabic-Turki compound
Originated.2_ Babur uses it in Hindistan where the neck-tassel

 Vigne’s Travelsin Kashmir ii, 277-8; Tarikh-i-rashidi trs., p.302 and n. and
p. 466 and note.

2 It is not likely to be one heard current in Hindiistan, any more than is Babur’s
Ar. 64-galamin as a name of a bird (Index s.7.) ; both seem to be ‘‘ book-words”
and may be traced or known as he uses them in some ancient dictionary or book of
travels originating outside Hindistan. :

and the tail of the domestic yak are articles of commerce, and
where, as also probably in Kabul, he will have known of the
same class of yak as a saddle-animal and as a beast of burden into
Kashmir and other border-lands of sufficient altitude to allow
its survival. A part of its wide Central Asian habitat abutting
on Kashmir is Little Tibet, through which flows the upper Indus
and in which tame yak are largely bred, Skardo being a place
specially mentioned by travellers as having them plentifully.
This suggests that the term dahri giitas is due to the great
river (dar) and that those of which Babur wrote in Hindustan
were from Little Tibet and its great river. But dakri may
apply to another region where also the domestic yak abounds,
that of the great lakes, inland seas such as Pangong, whence the
yak comes and goes between eg. Yarkand and the Hindistan
border.

The second suggestion, vzz. that “ dahkri gitas” refers to the
habitat of the domestic yak in lake and marsh lands of high
altitude (the wild yak also but, as Tibetan, it is less likely to be
concerned here) has support in Dozy’s account of the dahrz
falcon, a bird mentioned also by Abu’l-fazl amongst sporting
birds (Ayin-z-akbari, Blochmann’s trs. p.295) :—“ Bahri, espéce
de faucon le meilleur pour les otseaux de marais. Ce renseign-
ment explique peut-étre Vorigine du mot. Marguerite en donne
la méme etymologie que Tashmend et le Pére Guagix. Selon luz
ce faucon auratt été appelé ainsi parce qwil vient de autre coté
de la mer, mais peut-étre dériva-t-il de bahri dans le sens de
marais, flaque, étang.”

Dr. E. Denison Ross’ Polyglot List of Birds (Memoirs of the
Asiatic Society of Bengal ii, 289) gives to the Qara Qirghawal
(Black pheasant) the synonym “ Sea-pheasant”, this being the
literal translation of its Chinese name, and quotes from the ©
Manchi-Chinese “Mirror” the remark that this is a black ~
pheasant but called “sea-pheasant ” to distinguish it from other 4
black ones.

It may be observed that Babur writes of the yak once only
and then of the dehri gitas so that there is no warrant from him
for taking the term to apply to the wild yak. His cousin and



--- Page 331 ---
M.—ON THE TERM BAAR QUTAS. xlvii

contemporary Haidar Mirza, however, mentions the wild yak
twice and simply as the wild gédas.

The following are random gleanings about “dahri” and
the yak :—

(1) An instance of the use of the Persian equivalent dary@i
of dahri, sea-borne or over-sea, is found in the Akbar-naima (Bib.
Ind. ed. ii, 216) where the African elephant is described as /i7/-
z-darya i.

(2) In Egypt the word Jdahri has acquired the sense of
northern, presumably referring to what lies or is borne across its
northern sea, the Mediterranean.

(3) Vigne (Travels in Kashmir ii, 277-8) warns against
confounding the gich-gar te. the gigantic mouffion, Pallas’
_ Ovis ammon, with the Kosh-gau, the cow of the Kaucasus, z.e. the
yak. He says, “Kaucasus (/odze Hindi-kush) was originally
from Kosh, and Kosh is applied occasionally as a prefix, eg.
Kosh-gau, the yak or ox of the mountain or Kaucasus.” He
wrote from Skardo in Little Tibet and on the upper Indus.
He gives the name of the female yak as yak-smo and of the
half-breeds with common cows as 6zch, which class he says is
common and of “all colours”.

(4) Mr. Ney Elias’ notes (Tarikh-¢-rashidi trs. pp.302 and
466) on the gifas are of great interest. He gives the following
synonymous names for the wild yak, Bos Poéphagus, Khash-gau,
the Tibetan yak or Dong.

(5) Hume and Henderson (Lahor to Varkand p.59) write of
the numerous black yak-hair tents seen round the Pangong Lake,
of fine saddle yaks, and of the tame ones as being some white or
brown but mostly black.

(6) Olufsen’s Through the Unknown Pamirs (p.118) speaks
of the large numbers of Bos grunniens (yak) domesticated by
the Kirghiz in the Pamirs.

paraphrasing the Babur-nama f.2816,

N.—NOTES ON A FEW BIRDS.

IN attempting to identify some of the birds of Babur’s lists
difficulty arises from the variety of names provided by the
different tongues of the region concerned, and also in some
cases by the application of one name to differing birds. The
following random gleanings enlarge and, in part, revise some
earlier notes and translations of Mr. Erskine’s and my own.
They are offered as material for the use of those better acquainted
with bird-lore and with Himalayan dialects.

a. Concerning the likha, lija, licha, kija (£.135 and f.2780).

The nearest word I have found to /#ékha and its similars is
likkh, a florican (Jerdon, ii, 615), but the florican has not the
chameleon colours of the /#kha (var.). As Babur when writing
in Hindistan, uses such “book-words” as Ar. bahri (gitas) and
Ar. bii-galamiin (chameleon), it would not be strange if his name
for the “/ukha” bird represented Ar. awa, very beautiful, or
connected with Ar. /o#, shining splendour.

The form £#ja is found in Ilminsky’s imprint p. 361 (AZémozres
ii, 198, koudjeh).

What is confusing to translators is that (as it now seems t
me) Babur appears to use the name kadg-z-dari in both passage
(f.135 and f.2784) to represent two birds ; (1) he compares th
likha as to size with the kabg-z-dari of the Kabul region, an
(2) for size and colour with that of Hindistan. But the bird o
the Western Himalayas known by the name kadbg-¢-dari is t
Himalayan snow-cock, Tetraogallus himalayensis, Turki, ala
and in the Kabul region, chitirtika (f.249, Jerdon, ii, 549-50) ;
while the kabg-z-dari (syn. chikor) of Hindiistan, whether
hill or plain, is one or more of much smaller birds.

The snow-cock being 28 inches in length, the /#Aha bird must
be of this size. Such birds as to size and plumage of changin
colour are the Lophophori and Trapagons, varieties of which are
found in places suiting Babur’s account of the “ikha.



--- Page 333 ---
N.—NOTES ON A FEW BIRDS. xlix

It may be noted that the Himalayan snow-cock is still called
kabg-t-davit in Afghanistan (Jerdon, ii, 550) and in Kashmir
(Vigne’s Travels in Kashmir ii, 18). As its range is up to
18,000 feet, its Persian name describes it correctly whether read
as “of the mountains” (darz), or as “royal” (dari) through its
splendour.

I add here the following notes of Mr. Erskine’s, which I have
not quoted already where they occur (cf. f.135 and f. 2780) :—
On f.135, “lokheh” is said to mean hzll-chikor.
On f.2784, to “tijeh”, “ The Persian has likheh.”

F to “kepkie durri”, “The kepki deri, or durri is
much larger than the common epk of Persia
and is peculiar to Khorasan. It is said to be
a beautiful bird. The common eps of Persia
and Khorasan is the A7//-chtkor of India.”

Fy to “higher up”, “The “yeh may be the chzkor
of the plains which Hunter calls bartavelle or
Greek partridge.”

The following corrections are needed about my own notes :—
(1) on f.135 (p.213) n.7 is wrongly referred ; it belongs to the
first word, vz. kabg-2-dari, of p.214; (2) on f.279 (p.496) n.2
should refer to the second kabg-2-dari.

b. Birds called minal (var. monal and moonaul).

Yule writing in Hobson Jobson (p.580). of the “szoonaul” which
he identifies as Lophophorus Impeyanus, queries whether, on
grounds he gives, the word s#oonaul is connected etymologically
with Sanscrit #zu22z, an “eremite”. In continuation of his topic,
I give here the names of other birds called sz#na/, which I have
noticed in various ornithological works while turning their pages
for other information.

Besides L. Jimpeyanus and Trapagon Certornis satyra which
Yule mentions as called “soonaul”, there are L. refulgens,
minal and Ghiir (mountain)-minal, Trapagon Certornis satyra,
called minal in Nipal; 7. C. melanocephalus, called sing

(horned)-smdnal in the N.W. Himalayas; 7. Azmdalayensis, the
jer- or cher-miinal of the same region, known also as chizkor ;
and Lerwa nevicola, the snow-partridge known in Garhwal as
Quotr- or Qir-miinal. Do all these birds behave in such a way
as to suggest that mdzna/ may imply the individual isolation
related by Jerdon of L. Jimpeyanus, “ In the autumnal and winter
months numbers are generally collected in the same quarter of
the forest, though often so widely scattered that each bird
appears to be alone?” My own search amongst vocabularies of
hill-dialects for the meaning of the word has been unsuccessful,
spite of the long range smdandls in the Himalayas.

c. Concerning the word chitirttka, chourtka.

Jerdon’s entry (ii, 549, 554) of the name chourtka as a
synonym of Tetraogallus himalayensts enables me to filla gap
I have left on f.249 (p.491 and n.6),! with the name Himalayan
snow-cock, and to allow Babur’s statement to be that he, in
January 1520 AD. when coming down from the Bad-z-pich pass,
saw many snow-cocks. The JMemozrs (p.282) has “chzkors”,
which in India is a synonym for kabg-z-dari; the Mémoires
(ii, 122) has sauterelles, but this meaning of chitirtika does not
suit wintry January. That month would suit for the descent
from higher altitudes of snow-cocks. Griffith, a botanist who
travelled in Afghanistan cr. 1838AD., saw myriads of cécad@e
between Qilat-i-ghilzai and Ghazni, but the month was July.

ad. On the qiitan (£.142, p.224; Memotrs, p.153 ; Mémoires ii, 313).

Mr. Erskine for gi#tan enters khawasil [gold-finch] which he
will have seen interlined in the Elphinstone Codex (f.1094) in
explanation of gétan.

Shaikh Effendi (Kunos’ ed., p.139) explains gi#fan to be the
gold-finch, Stezglitz.

Ilminsky’s gitan (p.175) is translated by M. de Courteille as
pélicane and certainly some copies of the 2nd Persian translatio
[Muh. Shirazz’s p.90] have hawésii, pelican.

herons and egrets of Babur’s trio; it also would appear a more
likely bird to be caught “ with the cord”.

That Babur’s g#fan (hawasil) migrated in great numbers is
however against supposing it to be Pelicanus onocrotatus which
is seen in India during the winter, because it appears there in
moderate numbers only, and Blanford with other ornithologists
states that no western pelican migrates largely into India.

Perhaps the gi#fan was Linnzeus’ Pelicanus carbo of which
one synonym is Carbo comoranus, the cormorant, a bird seen in
India in large numbers of both the large and small varieties.
As cormorants are not known to breed in that country, they
will have migrated in the masses Babur mentions.

A translation matter falls to mention here :—After saying
that the agar (grey heron), gargara (egret), and gitan
(cormorant) are taken with the cord, Babur says that this
method of bird-catching is unique (6% nih gish titmag ghair
mugarrar dir) and describes it. The Persian text omits to

translate the ¢i#tmag (by P. giriftan); hence Erskine (ems.

p-153) writes, “The last mentioned fowl” (ze. the gétan) “is
rare,” notwithstanding Babur’s statement that all three of the
birds he names are caught in masses. De Courteille (p.313)
writes, as though only of the gidtdn, “ ces derniers toutefois ne se
prennent qu accidentelment,” perhaps led to do so by knowledge
of the circumstance that Pelzcanus onocrotatus is rare in India.

O.—NOTES BY HUMAYUN ON SOME
HINDUSTAN FRUITS.

THE following notes, which may be accepted as made by
Humayin and in the margin of the archetype of the Elphinstone
Codex, are composed in Turki which differs in diction from his
father’s but is far closer to that classic model than is that of the
producer [Jahangir?] of the “Fragments” (Index s.x.). Various
circumstances make the notes difficult to decipher verbatim and,
unfortunately, when writing in Jan. 1917, 1 am unable to collate

with its original in the Advocates Library, the copy I made of
them in I9I0.

a. On the kadhil jack-fruit, Artocarpus tntegrifolia (£.2836, p.506;
Elphinstone MS. f.2350).?

The contents of the note are that the strange-looking pumpkin
(gar, which is also Ibn Batuta’s word for the fruit), yields
excellent white juice, that the best fruit grows from the roots of
the tree,? that many such grow in Bengal, and that in Bengal
and Dihli there grows a kadhil-tree covered with hairs (Arto-
carpus hirsuta ?).

b. On the amrit-phal, mandarin-orange, Citrus auvantium (£.287,
p-512; Elphinstone Codex, f.2384, 1.12).

The interest of this note lies in its reference to Babur.

A Persian version of it is entered, without indication of what
it is or of who was its translator, in one of the volumes of
Mr. Erskine’s manuscript remains, now in the British Museum
(Add. 26,605, p.88). Presumably it was made by his Turkish
munshi for his note in the Memoirs (p. 329).

Various difficulties oppose the translation of the Turki note;
it is written into the text of the Elphinstone Codex in two
instalments, neither of them in place, the first being interpolated
in the account of the amz/-did fruit, the second in that of the
Jasin flower ; and there are verbal difficulties also. The Persian
translation is not literal and in some particulars Mr. Erskine’s
rendering of this differs from what the Turki appears to state.

The note is, tentatively, as follows :3—“ His honoured Majesty
Firdaus-makan4—may God make his proof clear !—did not

* By over-sight mention of this note was omitted from my article on the Elphinstone
Codex (JRAS. 1907, p. 131).

2 Speede’s /rdian Hand-book (i,212) published in 1841AD. thus writes, ‘It is
a curious circumstance that the finest and most esteemed fruit are produced from the
roots below the surface of the ground, and are betrayed by the cracking of the earth
above them, and the effluvia issuing from the fissure ; a high price is given by rich
natives for fruit so produced.”

3 In the margin of the Elphinstone Codex opposite the beginning of the note are
the words, ‘‘ This is a marginal note of Humayiin Padshah’s.”

4 Every Emperor of Hindistan has an epithet given him after his death to
distinguish him, and prevent the necessity of repeating his name too familiarly.
Thus /irdaus-makan (dweller-in-paradise) is Babur’s ; Huméayiin’s is /asnat-ashz-
yani, he whose nest is in Heaven; Muhammad Shah’s Firdaus-aramgah, he whose
place of rest is Paradise ; e¢c. (Erskine).

favour the amrzt-phal;* as he considered it insipid,? he likened
it to the mild-flavoured 3 orange and did not make choice of it.
So much was the mild-flavoured orange despised that if any
person had disgusted (him) by insipid flattery (?) he used to
say, ‘ He is like orange-juice.’” 4

“The amrit-phal is one of the very good fruits. Though its
juice is not relishing (? chzchiig), it is extremely pleasant-drinking.
Later on, in my own time, its real merit became known, Its
tartness may be that of the orange (#d@ranj) and emu.” 5

The above passage is followed, in the text of the Elphinstone
Codex, by Babur’s account of the jasiéiz flower, and into this
a further instalment of Humayin’s notes is interpolated, having
opposite its first line the marginal remark, “This extra note,
seemingly made by Humayiin Padshah, the scribe has mistakenly
written into the text.” Whether its first sentence refer to the
amrit-phal or to the amzl-bid must be left for decision to those
well acquainted with the orange-tribe. It is obscure in my copy
and abbreviated in its Persian translation ; summarized it may
state that when the fruit is unripe, its acidity is harmful to the
digestion, but that it is very good when ripe—The note then
continues as below :—

c. The kamila, H. kaunla, the orange®

“There are in Bengal two other fruits of the acid kind.
Though the amrit-phal be not agreeable, they have resemblance
to it (?).”

* Here Mr. Erskine notes, ‘‘ Literally, sectar-fruzt, probably the mandarin orange,
by the natives called sa@ringi. The name awirat, or pear, in India is applied to the
guava or Psidium pyriferum—(Spondias mangifera, Hort. Ben.—D. Wallich).” . . .
Mr. E. notes also that the note on the amrzt-phal ‘‘is not found in either of the
Persian translations”.

2 chichitman, Pers. trs. shirini bi maza, perhaps flat, sweet without relish. Babur
does not use the word, nor have I traced it in a dictionary.

3 chichiik, savoury, nice-tasting, not acid (Shaw).

4 chiichith naranj Gndag(?) mat‘un aidi kim har kim-ni shirin-karlighi bi maza
gilkandi, naranj-si’i dik tur dirlar aidi.

5 The /emzu may be Citrus limona, which has abundant juice of a mild acid flavour.

© The 4aémila and samfara are the real oranges (Aaunla and sangtara), which are
now (czv. 1816AD.) commonall over India. Dr. Hunter conjectures that the sangtara
may take its name from Cintra, in Portugal. This early mention of it hy Babur and
Humiayin may be considered as subversive of that supposition. (This description of
the samfara, vague as it is, applies closer to the Cztrus decumana or pampelmus, than
to any other.—D. Wallich. )—Erskine.

“One is the kamzla which may be as large as an orange
(na@ranj); some took it to be a large narangi (orange) but it is
much pleasanter eating than the x@rangi and is understood not
to have the skin of that (fruit).”

a. The samtara*

The other is the sasmzara which is larger than the orange
(naranj ) but is not tart ; unlike the amrzt-phal it is not of poor
flavour (kam maza) or little relish (chachik). In short a better
fruit is not seen. It is good to see, good to eat, good to digest.
One does not forget it. If it be there, no other fruit is chosen.
Its peel may be taken off by the hand. However much of the
fruit be eaten, the heart craves for it again. Its juice does not
soil the hand at all. Its skin separates easily from its flesh.
It may be taken during and after food. In Bengal the samtara
is rare (ghar) (or excellent, ‘az7z). It is understood to grow
in one village Sanargam (Sonargaon) and even there in a special
quarter. There seems to be no fruit so entirely good as the
samtara amongst fruits of its class or, rather, amongst fruits of
all kinds.”

more stately than that of the date.”

P.—REMARKS ON BABUR’S REVENUE
LIST (fol. 292).

a. Concerning the date of the List. >

The Revenue List is the last item of Babur’s account of Hindi-
stan and, with that account, is found s.a. 932 AH., manifestly

' Humiyiin writes of this fruit as though it were not the sawg-¢ara described by his
father on f. 287 (p. 511 and note).


--- Page 339 ---
P.—REMARKS ON BABUR’S REVENUE LIST. lv

too early, (1) because it includes districts and their revenues
which did not come under Babur’s authority until subdued in
his Eastern campaigns of 934 and 935AH., (2) because Babur’s
statement is that the “countries” of the List “are zow in my
possession ” (27 doco p.520).

The List appears to be one of revenues realized in 936 or
937 AH. and not one of assessment or estimated revenue,
(1) because Babur’s wording states as a fact that the revenue
was 52kriirs ; (2) because the Persian heading of the (Persian)
List is translatable as “ Revenue (jama‘)* of Hindiistan from
what has so far come under the victorious standards ”.

b. The entry of the List into European Literature.

Readers of the L. and E. ALemoirs of Babur are aware that
it does not contain the Revenue List (p.334). The omission is
due to the absence of the List from the Elphinstone Codex and
from the ‘Abdu’r-rahim Persian translation. Since the Memozrs
of Babur was published in 1826AD., the List has come from the
Babur-nama into European literature by three channels.

Of the three the one used earliest is Shaikh Zain’s Tabagat-z-
baburi which is a Persian paraphrase of part of Babur’s Hindistan
section. This work provided Mr. Erskine with what he placed
in his H7zstory of India (London 1854, i, 540, Appendix D), but
his manuscript, now B.M. Add. 26,202, is not the best copy
of Shaikh Zain’s book, being of far less importance than B.M.
Or. 1999, [as to which more will be said.] ?

The second channel is Dr. Ilminsky’s imprint of the Turki
text (Kasan 1857, p.379), which is translated by the A7énzozres
de Baber (Paris 1871, ii, 230).

The third channel is the Haidarabad Codex, in the English
translation of which [zz /oco] the List is on p.521.

Shaikh Zain may have used Babur’s autograph manuscript
for his paraphrase and with it the Revenue List. His own
autograph manuscript was copied in 998AH. (1589-90AD.) by

? M. de Courteille translated fama‘ in a general sense by /ofalité instead of in its
Indian technical one of revenue (as here) or of assessment. Hence Professor Dowson’s

“totality” (iv, 262 n.).

2 The B.M. has a third copy, Or. 5879, which my husband estimates as of little
importance.

\vi APPENDICES.

Khwand-amirs grandson ‘Abdu’l-lah who may be the scribe
“ Mir ‘Abdu’l-lah ” of the Ayin-2-akbari (Blochmann’s trs. p. 109).
‘Abdu'l-lah’s transcript (from which a portion is now absent,)
after having been in Sir Henry Elliot’s possession, has become
B.M. Or. 1999. It is noticed briefly by Professor Dowson (Zc.
iv, 288), but he cannot have observed that the “old, worm-eaten ”
little volume contains Babur’s Revenue List, since he does not
refer to it.

c. Agreement and variation in copies of the List.

The figures in the two copies (Or. 1999 and Add. 26,202) of
the Zabagat-¢-baburi are in close agreement. They differ, how-
ever, from those in the Haidarabad Codex, not only in a negli-
gible unit and a ten of ¢azkas but in having 20,000 more Zankas
from Oudhand Baraich and 30 /aks of tankas more from Trans-
sutle}j.

The figures in the two copies of the Babur-nadma, vis. the
Haidarabad Codex and the Kehr-Ilminsky imprint are not in
agreement throughout, but are identical in opposition to the
variants (20,000 ¢. and 30 7.) mentioned above. As the two are
independent, being collateral descendants of Babur’s original
papers, the authority of the Haidarabad Codex in the matter
of the List is still further enhanced.

ad. Varia.

(1) The place-names of the List are all traceable, whatever
their varied forms. About the entry L:kni [or L:knir] and B:ks:r
{or M:ks:r] a difficulty has been created by its variation in
manuscripts, not only in the List but where the first name occurs
s.a@. 934 and 935AH. In the Haidarabad List and in that of
Or. 1999 L:kniir is clearly written and may represent (approxi-
mately) modern Shahabad in Rampir. Erskine and de
Courteille, however, have taken it to be Lakhnau in Oudh.
[The distinction of Lakhnaur from Lakhnau in the historical —
narrative is discussed in Appendix T.]

(2) It may be noted, as of interest, that the name Sarwar is
an abbreviation of Sarjiipar which means “other side of Sarji'”
(Sari, Goghra ; E. and D.’s H. of I. i, 56, n.4).

(3) Riip-narain (Deo or Dev) is mentioned in Ajodhya
Prasad’s short history of Tirhut and Darbhanga, the Gu/zar-
t-Bihar (Calcutta 1869, Cap. v, 88) as the 9th of the Brahman
rulers of Tirhut and as having reigned for 25 years, from 917 to
942 Fasli(?). If the years were Hijri, 917-42AH. would be
1511-1535.7

(4) Concerning the zazka the following modern description
is quoted from Mr. R. Shaw’s High Tartary (London 1871,
p.464) “The tanga” (or ¢tanka) “is a nominal coin, being
composed of 25 little copper cash, with holes pierced in them
and called dahcheen. These are strung together and the quantity
of them required to make up the value of one of these silver
ingots” (“Zooroos or yamboo, value nearly £17”) “weighs
a considerable amount. I once sent to get change for a ooroos,
and my servants were obliged to charter a donkey to bring it
home.”

(5) The following interesting feature of Shaikh Zain’s
Tabagat-t-baburi has been mentioned to me by my husband :—
Its author occasionally reproduces Babur’s Turki words instead of
paraphrasing them in Persian, and does this for the noticeable
passage in which Babur records his dissatisfied view of Hindiistan
(f.2904, zz loco p.518), prefacing his quotation with the remark
that it is best and will be nearest to accuracy not to attempt
translation but to reproduce the Padshah’s own words. The
main interest of the matter lies in the motive for reproducing the
tpsissimaverba, \Was that motive deferential? Did the revelation
of feeling and opinion made in the quoted passage clothe it with
privacy so that Shaikh Zain reserved its perusal from the larger
public of Hindiistin who might read Persian but not Turki?
Some such motive would explain the insertion untranslated of
Babur’s letters to Humayiin and to Khwaja Kalan which are left
in Turki by ‘Abdu’r-rahim Mirza.?

t Sir G. A. Grierson, writing in the Zudian Antiquary (July 1885, p. 187), makes

Q.—CONCERNING THE “RAMPUR DIWAN”.

PENDING the wide research work necessary to interpret Babur
Hindiistan poems which the Rampir manuscript preserves, th
following comments, some tentative and open to correction,
may carry further in making the poems publicly known, what
Dr. E. Denison Ross has effected by publishing his Facsimil
of the manuscript.7 It is legitimate to associate comment on
the poems with the Babur-nama because many of them are in
it with their context of narrative ; most, if not all, connect with
it; some without it, would be dull and vapid.

a, An authorized English title.

The contents of the Rampir MS. are precisely what Babur
describes sending to four persons some three weeks after the date
attached to the manuscript,? vz. “the Translation and what-
not of poems made on coming to Hindistan”;3 and a similar
description may be meant in the curiously phrased first clause
of the colophon, but without mention of the Translation (of the
Watidiyyah-risala).4 Hence, if the poems, including the Trans-
lation, became known as the Hindistan Poems or Poems made in
Findistan, such title would be justified by their author’s words.
Babur does not call the Hindistan poems a dizvan even when,
as in the above quotation, he speaks of them apart from hi
versified translation of the Tract. In what has come down t
us of his autobiography, he applies the name Diwan to poems 0
his own once only, this in 925 AH. (f.2374) when he record
sending “my diwan” to Pulad Sl. Adzbeg.

* Cf. Index 21 loco for references to Babur’s metrical work, and for the Facsimile,
JASB. 1910, Extra Number.

? Monday, Rabi‘ II. 15th 935 AH.—Dec. 27th 1528ap. At this date Babur ha:
just returned from Dhiilpir to Agra (f 354, p. 635, where in note I for Thursday read
Monday).

3 Owing to a scribe’s ‘‘ skip” from one yibdrildi (was sent) to another at the en
of the next sentence, the passage is not inthe Hai. MS. It is not well given in my
translation (f. 3574, p. 642); what stands above is a closer rendering of the full Turki,
Humiyiingha tarjuma (uw?) ni-kim Hindistangha kilkani aitgan ash’arni yibarildt
(Ilminsky p. 462, 1. 4 fr. ft., where however there appears a slight clerical error).

4 Hesitation about accepting the colophon as unquestionably applying to the whole

contents of the manuscript is due to its position of close association with one section
only of the three in the manuscript (cf. Aos¢ p. Ix).


--- Page 343 ---
O.—CONCERNING THE “RAMPUR DIWAN ”. lix

6. The contents of the Rampir MS.

There are three separate items of composition in the manu-
script, marked as distinct from one another by having each its
ornamented frontispiece, each its scribe’s sign (sz) of Finis,
each its division from its neighbour by a space without entry.
The first and second sections bear also the official sign [sa4/] that
the copy has been inspected and found correct.

(1) The first section consists of Babur’s metrical translation
of Khwaja ‘Ubaidu'l-lah Ahrari’s Parental Tract (Walidiyyah-
risala), his prologue in which are his reasons for versifying the
Tract and his epilogue which gives thanks for accomplishing the
task. It ends with the date 935 (Hai. MS. f.346). Below this
are mim and sahh, the latter twice ; they are in the scribe’s hand-
writing, and thus make against supposing that Babur wrote down
this copy of the Tract or its archetype from which the official
Sahh will have been copied. Moreover, spite of bearing two
vouchers of being a correct copy, the Translation is emended, in
a larger script which may be that of the writer of the marginal
quatrain on the last page of the [Rampir] MS. and there attested
by Shah-i-jahan as Babur’s autograph entry. His also may have
been the now expunged writing on the half-page left empty of
text at theend of the Tract. Expunged though it be, fragments
of words are visible.*

_ (2) The second section has in its frontispiece an inscription

illegible (to me) in the Facsimile. It opens with a masnawi of
41 couplets which is followed by a gfazel and numerous poems
in several measures, down to a triad of rhymed couplets (watla‘?),
the whole answering to descriptions of a Diwan without formal
arrangement. After the last couplet are mim and sahh in the
scribe’s hand-writing, and a blank quarter-page. Mistakes in
this section have been left uncorrected, which supports the view
that its sa%z avouches the accuracy of its archetype and not
its own.?

* Plate XI, and p. 15 (mid-page) of the Facsimile booklet.—The Facsimile does
not show the whole of the marginal quatrain, obviously because for the last page of
the manuscript a larger photographic plate was needed than for the rest. With
Dr. Ross’ concurrence a photograph in which the defect is made good, accompanies
this Appendix.

? The second section ends on Plate XVII, and p. 21 of the Facsimile booklet.


--- Page 344 ---
Ix APPENDICES.

(3) The third section shows no inscription on its frontispiece.
It opens with the masnawiz of eight couplets, found also in the
Babur-nadma (f.312), one of earlier date than many of the poems
in the second section. It is followed by three rada‘% which
complete the collection of poems made in Hindistan. A prose
passage comes next, describing the composition and trans-
position-in-metre ofa couplet of 16 feet, with examples in three
measures, the last of which ends in 1.4 of the photograph.
While fixing the date of this metrical game, Babur incidentally
allows that of his Treatise on Prosody to be inferred from the
following allusive words:—“When going to Sambhal (f. 3304) in
the year (933 AH.) after the conquest of Hindiistan (932 AH.), two
years after writing the ‘Avdz, I composed a couplet of 16 feet.”
—From this the date of the Treatise is seen to be 931 AH., some
two years later than that of the J7ubin. The above metrical
exercise was done about the same time as another concerning
which a Treatise was written, vzz. that mentioned on f.330d,
when a couplet was transposed into 504 measures (Section 7,
p. Ixv).—The Facsimile, it will be noticed, shows something
unusual in the last line of the prose passage on Plate XVIII B,
where the scattering of the words suggests that the scribe was
trying to copy page fer page.

The colophon (which begins on 1.5 of the photograph) is
curiously worded, as though the frequent fate of last pages had
befallen its archetype, that of being mutilated and difficult for
a scribe to make good; it suggests too that the archetyp
was verse.’ Its first clause, even if read as Hind-stan janzbi
‘asimat qilghani (i.e. not gilghali, as it can be read), has a
indirectness unlike Babur’s corresponding “after coming t
Hindistan ” (f. 3574), and is not definite; (2) J% airdi (thes
were) is not the complement suiting a# dirir (those are)
(3) Babur does not use the form d#rir in prose; (4) the undu
space after dirair suggests connection with verse; (5) there is
no final verb such as prose needs. The meaning, however
may be as follows:—The poems made after resolving on (the

t Needless to say that whatever the history of the manuscript, its value as preservin
poems of which no other copy is known publicly, is untouched. This value woul
be great without the marginal entries on the last page; it finds confirmation in thi
identity of many of the shorter poems with counterparts in the Babur-nama.

Hindiistan parts (7azbz?) were these I have written down (¢ahrir
gildim), and past events are those I have narrated (¢agrir) in the
way that (wi-chak kim) (has been) written in these folios (azraq)
and recorded in those sections (ajza’)—From this it would
appear that sections of the Badur-ndma (f. 3760, p. 678) accom-
panied the Hindiistan poems to the recipient of the message
conveyed by the colophon.

Close under the colophon stands Yarara-hu Babur and the date
Monday, Rabi‘ II. 15th 935 (Monday, December 27th 1528 aD.),
the whole presumably brought over from the archetype. To the
question whether a signature in the above form would be copied
by a scribe, the Elphinstone Codex gives an affirmative answer
by providing several examples of notes, made by Humayin in

its archetype, so-signed and brought over either into its margin

or interpolated in its text. Some others of Humayiin’s notes
are not so-signed, the scribe merely saying they are Humayin
Padshah’s.—It makes against taking the above entry of Babur’s
name to be an autograph signature, (1) that it is enclosed in an
ornamented border, as indeed is the case wherever it occurs
throughout the manuscript; (2) that it is followed by the
scribe’s mim. [See end of following section.]

¢. The marginal entries shown in the photograph.
The marginal note written length-wise by the side of the text

“is signed by Shah-i-jahan and attests that the ruda‘t and the
signature to which it makes reference are in Babur’s autograph
hand-writing. His note translates as follows :—This quatrain
and blessed name are in the actual hand-writing of that Majesty
(Gn hazrat) Firdaus-makani Babur Padshah Ghazi—May God
make his proof clear !—Signed (arara-hu), Shah-i-jahan son
of Jahangir Padshah son of Akbar Padshah son of Humayiin
Padshah son of Babur Padshah.?

* Another autograph of Shah-i-jahan’s is included in the translation volume (p. xiii)
of Gul-badan Begam’s Hemdyin-ndma. It surprises one who works habitually on
historical writings more nearly contemporary with Babur, in which he is spoken of
as Firdaus-makani or as Giti-sttani Firdaus-makdani and not by the name used during
his life, to find Shah-i-jahan giving him the two styles (cf. /ahangir’s Memoirs trs.
ii, 5). Those familiar with the writings of Shah-i-jahan’s biographers will know
whether this is usual at that date. There would seem no doubt as to the identity of
an Hazrat.—The words az hazrat by which Shah-i-jahan refers to Babur are used
also in the epitaph placed by Jahangir at Babur’s tomb (Trs. Note p. 710-711).

The second marginal entry is the curiously placed 7uba‘z, which
is now the only one on the page, and now has no signature
attaching to it. It has the character of a personal message to
the recipient of one of more books having identical contents.
That these two entries are there while the text seems so clearly
to be written by a scribe, is open to the explanation that when
(as said about the colophon, p.1x) the rectangle of text was made
good froma mutilated archetype, the original margin was placed
round the r¢facimento ? This superposition would explain the
entries and seal-like circles, discernible against a strong light, on
the reverse of the margin only, through the r2facimento page.
The upper edge of the rectangle shows sign that the margin has
been adjusted to it [so far as one can judge from a photograph].
Nothing on the face of the margin hints that the text itself is
autograph ; the words of the colophon, ¢ahrir gildim (ze. [have
written down) cannot hold good against the cumulative testimony
that a scribe copied the whole manuscript.—The position of the
last syllable [zz] of the ruéa‘t shows that the signature below
the colophon was on the margin before the diagonal couplet of
the ruba‘% was written,—therefore when the margin was fitted,
as it looks to have been fitted, to the vzfacimento. If this be the
order of the two entries [ze the small-hand signature and the
diagonal couplet], Shah-i-jahan’s “blessed name” may repre-
sent the small-hand signature which certainly shows minute
differences from the writing of the text of the MS. in the name
Babur (¢.v. passim in the Rampir MS.).

d. The Baburi-khatt (Babir's script).

So early as 9IOAH. the year of his conquest of Kabul, Babu
devised what was probably a variety of zakhsh, and called it th
Baburi-khatt (f.1446), a name used later by Haidar Mirza
Nizamu’d-din Ahmad and ‘Abdu’l-qadir Badayiini. He write
of it again (f. 179) s.a. 911 AH. when describing an interview hai
in 912 AH. with one of the Harat Qazis, at which the script wa
discussed, its specialities (sfradat) exhibited to, and read by th
Qazi who there and then wrote in it* In what remains to u

™ The Qazi’s rapid acquirement of the mzfradat of the script allows the inferenc

of the Babur-nama it is not mentioned again till 935 AH. (fol. 3570)
but at some intermediate date Babur made in it a copy of the
Qoran which he sent to Makkat In 935 AH. (f. 3570) it is
mentioned in significant association with the despatch to each
of four persons of a copy of the Translation (of the Waldiyyah-
riséla) and the Hindiistan poems, the significance of the associa-
tion being that the simultaneous despatch with these copies
of specimens of the Saburi-khatt points to its use in the manu-
scripts, and at least in Hind-al’s case, to help given for reading
novel forms in their text. The above are the only instances
now found in the Sabur-nama of mention of the script.

The little we have met with—we have made no search—about
the character of the script comes from the Adishga, s.n. sighnagq,
_ in the following entry :—

Sighnag ber nit‘ah khatt der Chaghataida khatt Baburi u ghairi
hibi ki Babur Mirza ash‘ar nda kiliir batt

Khiblar khatti nasib'ng biilmasa Babur ni tang ?
Baburi khattt aimas dur khatt sighnagi mii diir ??

The old Osmanli-Turkish prose part of this appears to mean :—
“Sighnag is a sort of hand-writing, in Chaghatai the Baburi-
khatt and others resembling it, as appears in Babur Mirza’s
poems. Couplet ” :—

Without knowing the context of the couplet I make no
attempt to translate it because its words kAatt or khat and

by the light of more recent information about the Baburi-khatt leads me to think-this
is wrong because ‘‘alphabet” includes every letter.—On f. 3574 three items of the
Baburi-khatt are specified as despatched with the Hindistin poems, vz. mufradat,
gita‘lar and sar-i-khatt. Of these the first went to Hind-al, the third to Kamran,
and no recipient is named for the second ; all translators have sent the g7fa‘/ar to
Hind-al but I now think this wrong and that a name has been omitted, probably
Tlumayin’s.

* f, 1444, p. 228,n.3. Another interesting matter missing from the Babur-nama by
the gap between 914 and 925 AH. is the despatch of an embassy to Czar Vassili III. in
Moscow, mentioned in Schuyler’s Turkistan ii, 394, Appendix IV, Grigorief’s Russian
Policy in Central Asia. The mission went after ‘‘ Sultan Babur” had established
himself in Kabul; as Babur does not write of it before his narrative breaks off
abruptly in 914 AH. it will have gone after that date. .

2 T quote from the Véliaminof-Zernov edition (p. 287) from which de Courteille’s
plan of work involved extract only; he translates the couplet, giving to khatt the
double-meanings of script and down of youth (Dictionnaire Turque s.n. sighnagi).
The Sanglakh (p. 252) s.n. sighnag has the following as Babur’s :—

Chit balai khatti nasil’ ng bilmasa Babur ni tang?
Bare khatt almansir khatt sighnagi mi dur ?


--- Page 350 ---
Ixiv APPENDICES.

sighnag \end themselves to the kind of pun (zham) “which
consists in the employment of a word or phrase having more
than one appropriate meaning, whereby the reader is often left
in doubt as to the real significance of the passage.” The rest of
the xuba@‘Z may be given [together with the six other quotations
of Babur’s verse now known only through the Adizshga], in early
Tazktratu ’sh-shu‘ara of date earlier than 967 AH.

The root of the word sighnag will be sig, pressed together,
crowded, included, e¢c. ; taking with this notion of compression,
the explanations fezxe Schrift of Shaikh Effendi (Kunos) and
Vambéry’s pétite écriture, the Sighnaqi and Baburi Scripts are
allowed to have been what that of the Rampir MS. is, a small,
compact, elegant hand-writing—A town in the Caucasus
named Sighnakh, “sztuce &@ peu prés & 800 métres daltitude,
commenca par étre une forteresse et un lieu de refuge, car telle
est la signification de son nom tartare.”* Sighnagi is given by
de Courteille (Dict. p. 368) as meaning a place of refuge or
shelter.

The Baburi-khatt will be only one of the several hands Babur
is reputed to have practised ; its description matches it with
other niceties he took pleasure in, fine distinctions of eye and
ear in measure and music.

é. Is the Rampir MS. an example of the Baburi-khatt ?

Though only those well-acquainted with Oriental manuscripts
dating before 910 AH. (1504 AD.) can judge whether noveltie
appear in the script of the Rampir MS. and this particularly
in its head-lines, there are certain grounds for thinking that
though the manuscript be not Babur’s autograph, it may be in
his script and the work of a specially trained scribe.

I set these grounds down because although the signs of a
scribe’s work on the manuscript seem clear, it is “locally” held to
be Babur’s autograph. Has a tradition of its being in the Baburi-
khatt glided into its being in the Ahatt-2-Babur? Several circum-
stances suggest that it may be written in the Baburi-khatt :—
(1) the script is specially associated with the four transcripts

Q.—CONCERNING THE “RAMPUR DIWAN”, Ixv

of the Hindiistan poems (f. 3574), for though many letters
must have gone to his sons, some indeed are mentioned in the
Babur-nama, it is only with the poems that specimens of it are
recorded as sent ; (2) another matter shows his personal interest
in the arrangement of manuscripts, namely, that as he himself
about a month after the four books had gone off, made a new
ruler, particularly on account of the head-lines of the Translation,
it may be inferred that he had made or had adopted the one
he superseded, and that his plan of arranging the poems was the
model for copyists; the Rampiir MS. bearing, in the Translation
section, corrections which may be his own, bears also a date
earlier than that at which the four gifts started ; it has its head-
lines ill-arranged and has throughout 13 lines to the page ; his
- new ruler had 11; (3) perhaps the words ¢ahrir gildim used in
the colophon of the Rampir MS. should be read with their full
connotation of careful and elegant writing, or, put modestly, as
saying, “I wrote down in my best manner,” which for poems is
likely to be in the Baburi-khatt.*

Perhaps an example of Babur’s script exists in the colophon,
if not in the whole of. the AZudimz manuscript once owned by
Berézine, by him used for his Chréstomathie Turque, and described
by him as “unique”. If this be the actual manuscript Babur
sent into Ma wara’u’n-nahr (presumably to Khwaja Ahrari’s
family), its colophon which is a personal message addressed to
the recipients, is likely to be autograph.

J. Metrical amusements.

(1) Of two instances of metrical amusements belonging to the
end of 933 AH. and seeming to have been the distractions of
illness, one is a simple transposition “in the fashion of the
circles” (dawd’zr) into three measures (Rampir MS. Facsimile,
Plate XVIII and p. 22) ; the other is difficult because of the high
number of 504 into which Babur says (f. 3304) he cut up the
following couplet :—

Giz u gash u soz u tilint mit di ?
Qad u khadd u saj u bilint mi di ?

* On this same ¢ahrir gildim may perhaps rest the opinion that the Rampir MS. is
autograph.


--- Page 352 ---
Ixvi APPENDICES.

All manuscripts agree in having 504, and Babur wrote a tract
(vésa@la) upon the transpositions.! None of the modern treatises
on Oriental Prosody allow a number so high to be practicable,
but Maulana Saifi of Bukhara, of Babur’s own time (f. 1800)
makes 504 seem even moderate, since after giving much detail
about »udaZ measures, he observes, “Some say there are 10,000”
(Ariiz-t-Saifi, Ranking’s trs. p. 122). Presumably similar possi-
bilities were open for the couplet in question. It looks like one
made for the game, asks two foolish questions and gives no
reply, lends itself to poetic license, and, if permutation of words
have part in such a game, allows much without change of sense.
Was Babur’s cessation of effort at 504 capricious or enforced by
the exhaustion of possible changes? Is the arithmetical state-
ment 9X8 X 7=504 the formula of the practicable permu-
tations ?

(2) To improvise verse having a given rhyme and topic must
have demanded quick wits and much practice. Babur gives at
least one example of it (f. 252) but Jahangir gives a fuller and
more interesting one, not only because a 7#ba’z of Babur’s was the
model but from the circumstances of the game :?—It was in
1024 AH. (1615 AD.) that a letter reached him from Ma wara’u’n-
nahr written by Khwaja Hashim Magsh-bandi [who by the story
is shown to have been of Ahrari’s line], and recounting the
long devotion of his family to Jahangir’s ancestors. He sent
gifts and enclosed in his letter a copy of one of Babur’s quatrai
which he said Hazrat Firdaus-makani had written for Hazr:
Khwajagi (Ahrari’s eldest son; f. 360, p.62 n.2). Jahangi
quotes a final hemistich only, “Khwdajagtra mandadim, Khwa
Jjagiva banda im,’ and thereafter made an impromptu verse upo
the one sent to him.

A curious thing is that the line he quotes is not part of th
quatrain he answered, but belongs to another not appropriate fo
a message between darwesh and padshah, though likely to hav
been sent by Babur to Khwajagi. I will quote both becau

t I have found no further mention of the tract ; it may be noted however that where
Babur calls his 7reatise on Prosody (written in 931 AH.) the ‘Ariz, Abi’l-fazl writ
of a Mufassal, a suitable name for 504 details of transposition.

the matter will come up again for who works on the Hindistan
poems.*

(1) The quatrain from the Hinxdiistan Poems is :—

Dar haw@i nafs gumrah ‘umr zat kardaim [kandaim ?] ;
Pesh ahl-t-allah az afal-t-khid sharmanda im,
Vak nasr ba mukhlasan-t-khasta-dil farma ki ma
Khwajagiva mandaim u Khwajagira bandaim.
(2) That from the Akéar-nama is -—
Darweshanra agarcha nah as khweshanim,
Lek az dil u jan mu‘taqid eshanim ;
Dir ast magi% shahi az darweshi,
Shahim wali banda-t-darweshanim.

The greater suitability of the second is seen from Jahangir’s
answering impromptu for which by sense and rhyme it sets the
model ; the meaning, however, of the fourth line in each may be
identical, namely, “I remain the ruler but am the servant of the
darwesh.’ Jahangir’s impromptu is as follows :—

Ai anki mara mihr-t-ti besh az besh ast,
Az daulat yad-t-biidat ai darwesh ast,
Chandanki’s muzhdahat dilam shad shavad
Shadim az anki latif az hadd besh ast.

He then called on those who had a turn for verse to “speak
one” z.e. to improvise on his own; it was done as follows :—

‘

Darim agarcha shaghal-i-shahi dar pesh,

Har lahga kunim yad-t-darweshan besh ;
Gar shad shavad’z ma dil-t-yak darwesh,
Anra shumarim hasil-t-shahi khwesh.

THE courtesy of the Government of India enables me to re-
produce from the Archeological Survey Reports of 1871, Sir
Alexander Cunningham’s plans of Chandiri and Gialiar, which

S.—CONCERNING THE BABUR-NAMA
DATING OF 935 an.

THE dating of the diary of 935 AH. (f.339 e¢ seq.) is several time
in opposition to what may be distinguished as the “ book-rule”
that the 12 lunar months of the Hijra year alternate in length
between 30 and 29 days (intercalary years excepted), and tha
Muharram starts the alternation with 30 days. An early boo
stating the rule is Gladwin’s Bengal Revenue Accounts ; a recent
one, Ranking’s ed. of Platts’ Perstan Grammar.

As to what day of the week was the initial day of some of th
months in 935AH. Babur’s days differ from Wiistenfeld’s wh
gives the full list of twelve, and from Cunningham’s single one 0
Muharram Ist.

It seems worth while to draw attention to the flexibility,
within limits, of Babur’s dating, [not with the object of adversely
criticizing a rigid and convenient rule for common use, but as
supplementary to that rule from a somewhat special source]
because he was careful and observant, his dating was con-
temporary, his record, as being de die 7a diem, provides a check
of consecutive narrative on his dates, which, moreover, are all held
together by the external fixtures of Feasts and by the marked
recurrence of Fridays observed. Few such writings as the Babur-
nama diaries appear to be available for showing variation within
a year’s limit.

In 935AH. Babur enters few full dates, ze. days of the wee
and month. Often he gives only the day of the week, the safest,
however, in a diary. He is precise in saying at what time o
the night or the day an action was done; this is useful not only
as helping to get over difficulties caused by minor losses 0
text, but in the more general matter of the transference o
a Hijra night-and-day which begins after sunset, to its Julian
equivalent, of a day-and-night which begins at 12am. Thi
sometimes difficult transference affords a probable explanation
of a good number of the discrepant dates found in Oriental—
Occidental books.

Two matters of difference between the Babur-nama dating
and that of some European calendars are as follows :—


--- Page 357 ---
S.—CONCERNING THE BABUR-NAMA DATING OF 9354.H. _Ixxi

a. Discrepancy as to the day of the week on which Muh. 935 Au.
began.

This discrepancy is not a trivial matter when a year’s diary
is concerned. The record of Muh. Ist and 2nd is missing from
the Babur-nama; Friday the 3rd day of Muharram is the first
day specified ; the Ist was a Wednesday therefore. Erskine
accepted this day ; Cunningham and Wiistenfeld give Tuesday.
On three grounds Wednesday seems right—at any rate at that
period and place :—(1) The second Friday in Muharram was
‘Ashiir, the roth (f.240); (2) Wednesday is in serial order if
reckoning be made from the last surviving date of 934.AH. with
due allowance of an intercalary day to Zi’l-hijja (Gladwin),
ze. from Thursday Rajab 12th (April 2nd 1528 ap. f. 339, p.602);
(3) Wednesday is supported by the daily record of far into the
year.

6. Variation in the length of the months of 935 AH.

There is singular variation between the Babur-nama and
Wistenfeld’s Zad/es, both as to the day of the week on which
months began, and as to the length of some months. This
variation is shown in the following table, where asterisks mark
agreement as to the days of the week, and the capital letters,
quoted from W.’s Zadles, denote A, Sunday; B, Tuesday, etc.
(the bracketed names being of my entry).

{xxii APPENDICES.

The table shows that notwithstanding the discrepancy dis-
cussed in section a, of Babur’s making 935 AH. begin on a
Wednesday, and Wiistenfeld on a Tuesday, the two authoritie
agree as to the initial week-day of four months out of twelv
vig. Safar, Sha‘ban, Shawwal and Zil-hijja.

Again :—In eight of the months the Babur-ndma reverses
the “book-rule” of alternative Muharram 30days, Safar 29 days
et seg. by giving Muharram 29, Safar 30. (This is seen readily
by following the initial days of the week.) Again :—these eight
months are in pairs having respectively 29 and 30 days, and thi
year’s total is 364.—Four months follow the fixed rule, ze. as
though the year had begun Muh. 30 days, Safar 29 days—
namely, the two months of Rabi‘ and the two of Jumada.—
Ramzan to which under “book-rule” 30 days are due, had
29 days, because, as Babur records, the Moon was seen on the
29th.—In the other three instances of the reversed 30 and 29
one thing is common, vz. Muharram, Rajab, Zi’l-qa‘da (as als
Zi'l-hijja) are “honoured” months.—It would be interesting i
some expert in this Musalman matter would give the reason
dictating the changes from rule noted above as occurring i
935 AH.

c. Varia.

(1) On f.367 Saturday is entered as the Ist day of Sha‘ban
and Wednesday as the 4th, but on f.3684 stands Wednesday 5
as suits the serial dating. If the mistake be not a mere slip,
may be due to confusion of hours, the ceremony chronicle
being accomplished on the eve of the 5th, Anglicé, after sunse
on the 4th.

(2) A fragment only survives of the record of Zw’l-hijj
935AH. It contains a date, Thursday 7th, and mentions a Feas
which will be that of the ‘/dw’l-kabir on the 10th (Sunday).
Working on from this to the first-mentioned day of 936AH. vzs.
Tuesday, Muharram 3rd, the month (which is the second of a pai
having 29 and 30 days) is seen to have 30 days and so to fit on
to936AH. The series is Sunday 1oth, 17th, 24th (Sat. 30th)
Sunday Ist, Tuesday 3rd.

Two clerical errors of mine in dates connecting with this
Appendix are corrected here:—(1) On p.614 n.5, for Oct. 2nd
read Oct. 3rd; (2) on p. 619 penultimate line of the text, for
Nov. 28th read Nov. 8th.

T—ON L:KNU (LAKHNAU) AND L:KNUR
(LAKHNUR, NOW SHAHABAD IN
RAMPUR).

ONE or other of the above-mentioned names occurs eight times
in the Dabur-nama (5.a. 932, 934, 935 AH.), some instances being
shown by their context to represent Lakhnau in Oudh, others
inferentially and by the verbal agreement of the Haidarabad
Codex and Kehr’s Codex to stand for Lakhniir (now Shahabad
in Rampir). It is necessary to reconsider the identification of
those not decided by their context, both because there is so
much variation in the copies of the ‘Abdu’r-rahim Persian trans-
lation that they give no verbal help, and because Mr. Erskine
and M. de Courteille are in agreement about them and took the
whole eight to represent Lakhnau. This they did on different
grounds, but in each case their agreement has behind it a defective
textual basis——Mr. Erskine, as is well known, translated the
‘Abdu’r-rahim Persian text without access to the original Turki
but, if he had had the Elphinstone. Codex when translating,
it would have given him no help because all the eight instances
occur on folios not preserved by that codex. His only sources
were not-first-rate Persian MSS. in which he found casual
variation from terminal xi to mir, which latter form may have
been read by him as ##z# (whence perhaps the old Anglo-Indian
transliteration he uses, Luknow).1—M. de Courteille’s position
is different ; his uniform Lakhnau obeyed the same uniformity
in his source the Kasdan Imprint, and would appear to him the

more assured for the concurrence of the MWemozrs. His text
basis, however, for these words is Dr. IIminsky’s and not
No doubt the uniform Lakhni of the Kasan Imprint is t
result of Dr. Ilminsky’s uncertainty as to the accuracy of
single Turki archetype [Kehr’s MS.], and also of his acceptance
Mr. Erskine’s uniform Luknow.'—Since the Haidarabad Cod
became available and its collation with Kehr’s Codex has b
made, a better basis for distinguishing between the L:kni a

the collation are entered in the following table, together wi
what is found in the Kasan Imprint and the Memozrs. [N.B.
two sets of bracketed instances refer each to one place; t
asterisks show where IIminsky varies from Kehr.]

The following notes give some grounds for accepting th
names as the two Turki codices agree in giving them :—

The first and second instances of the above table, those
the Hai. Codex f.2784 and f.338, are shown by their context
represent Lakhnau.

The third (f-2920) is an item of Babur’s Revenue List. T
Turki codices are supported by B.M. Or. 1999, which is a dir
copy of Shaikh Zain’s autograph Zabagat-¢-baburi, all th
having L:knir. Kehr’s MS. and Or. 1999 are descendants

the Russian Foreign Office in lending it for my use, under the charge of the Libraria
of the India Office, Dr. F. W. Thomas.—It should be observed that in this Cod
the Hindistin Section contains the purely Turki text found in the Haidarabad Code:

of the various items.——An important consideration supporting
L-knitr, is that the List is in Persian and may reasonably be
accepted as the one furnished officially for the Padshah’s
information when he was writing his account of Hindistan (cf.
Appendix P, p. liv). This official character disassociates it from
any such doubtful spelling by the foreign Padshah as cannot
but suggest itself when the variants of eg. Dalmau and Ban-
garmau are considered. L:kniir is what three persons copying
independently read in the official List, and so set down that
careful scribes ze. Kehr and ‘Abdu'l-lah (App. P) again wrote
L:knir.2—Another circumstance favouring L:knir (Lakhnir) is
that the place assigned to it in the List is its geographical one
between Sambhal and Khairabad.—Something for [or perhaps
against] accepting Lakhnir as the sarkadr of the List may be
known in local records or traditions. It had been an important
place, and later on it paid a large revenue to Akbar [as part of
Sambhal].—It appears to have been worth the attention of
Biban /alwani (f.329).—Another place is associated with L:knir
in the Revenue List, the forms of which are open to a con-
siderable number of interpretations besides that of Baksar shown
in loco on p.521. Only those well acquainted with the United
Provinces or their bye-gone history can offer useful suggestion
about it. Maps show a “ Madkar” 6m. south of old Lakhnir;
there are in the United Provinces two Baksars and as many
other Lakhnirs (none however being so suitable as what is now
Shahabad). Perhaps in the archives of some old families there
may be help found to interpret the entry L-knir u B-ks-r (var.),
a conjecture the less improbable that the Gazetteer of the
Province of Oude (ii, 58) mentions a farman of Babur Padshah’s
dated 1527 AD. and upholding a grant to Shaikh Qazi of Bilgram.

The fourth instance (f.329) is fairly confirmed as Lakhnir
by its context, vz. an officer received the district of Badayiin
from the Padshah and was sent against Biban who had laid
siege to L:knir on which Badayiin bordered—At the time
Lakhnau may have been held from Babur by Shaikh Bayazid

tit may indicate that the List was not copied by Babur but lay loose with his
papers, that it is not with the Elphinstone Codex, and is not with the ‘Abdu’r-rahim
Persian translation made from a manuscript of that same annotated line.

Farmuli in conjunction with Aid. Its estates are recorded as
still in Farmili possession, that of the widow of “Kala Pahar”
Farmiili—( See infra.)

The fifth instance (f.334) connects with Aid (Oudh) because
royal troops abandoning the place L:kni were those who had
been sent against Shaikh Bayazid in Aid.

The remaining three instances (f.376, f.3764, £377) appear
to concern one place, to which Biban and Bayazid were
rumoured to intend going, which they captured and abandoned.
As the table of variants shows, Kehr’s MS. reads Lakhnir in
all three places, the Hai. MS. once only, varying from itself as
it does in Nos. I and 2,—A circumstance supporting Lakhnir
is that one of the messengers sent to Babur with details of the
capture was the son of Shah Muh. Diwdua whose record associates
him rather with Badakhshan, and with Humayiin and Sambhal
[perhaps with Lakhnir itself] than with Babur’s own army.—
Supplementing my notes on these three instances, much could
be said in favour of reading Lakhnir, about time and distance
done by the messengers and by ‘Abdu'l-lah £ztabdar, on his way
to Sambhal and passing near Lakhnir; much too about the
various rumours and Babur’s immediate counter-action. But
to go into it fully would need lengthy treatment which the
historical unimportance of the little problem appears not to
demand.—Against taking the place to be Lakhnau there are the
considerations (a) that Lakhnir was the safer harbourage for
the Rains and less near the westward march of the royal troops
returning from the battle of the Goghra ; (4). that the fort of
Lakhnau was the renowned old Machchi-bawan (cf. Gazetteer
of the Province of Oude, 3 vols., 1877, ii, 366).—So far as I have
been able to fit dates and transactions together, there seems no
reason why the two Afghans should not have gone to Lakhnir,
have crossed the Ganges near it, dropped down south [perhaps
even intending to recross at Dalmau] with the intention of
getting back to the Farmiilis and Jalwanis perhaps in Sarwar,
perhaps elsewhere to Bayazid’s brother Ma‘rif.

U.—INSCRIPTIONS ON BABUR’S MOSQUE, AJODHYA. Ixxvii

U._THE INSCRIPTIONS ON BABUR’S
MOSQUE IN AJODHYA (OUDH).

THANKS to the kind response made by the Deputy-Com-
missioner of Fyzabad to miy husband’s enquiry about two
inscriptions mentioned by several Gazetteers as still existing
on “ Babur’s Mosque” in Oudh, I am able to quote copies of
both.?

a. The inscription inside the Mosque is as follows :—

Dh o2fEob outs * ie Sh alt 0d 92,4 -\

DMs. le Sean by. pla SLs wy
=
Gb as 2, pad Satcte # ab dle Ghsos

1, Ba farmitda-t-Shah Babur ki ‘adilash

2. Bani kard in muhbit-t-qudsiyan
Amir-t-saadat-nishan Mir Bagi

3. Bavad khacr bagi! chit sal-t-ban@ish
‘Tyan shud ki guftam,—Buvad khair bagi (935).

The translation and explanation of the above, manifestly
made by a Musalman and as such having special value, are as
follows :—?

1. By the command of the Emperor Babur whose justice is
an edifice reaching up to the very height of the heavens,

2. The good-hearted Mir Baqi built this alighting-place of
angels ; 3

3. Bavad khair bagi! (May this goodness last for ever'!) 4

* Cf. zn loco p. 656, n. 3.

? A few slight changes in the turn of expressions have been made for clearness sake.

3 Index s.%. Mir Baqi of Tashkint. Perhaps a better epithet for sa‘adat-nishan
than ‘‘ good-hearted” would be one implying his good fortune in being designated
to build a mosque on the site of the ancient Hindi temple. .

4 There is a play here on Baqi’s name ; perhaps a good wish is expressed for his
Prosperity together with one for the long permanence of the sacred building £hazr
(khatrat).

{e]


--- Page 364 ---
Ixxviii APPENDICES.

The year of building it was made clear likewise when I said,
Buvad khair bagi (=935).

The explanation of this is :—

Ist couplet :—The poet begins by praising the Emperor Babur
under whose orders the mosque was erected. As justice is the
(chief) virtue of kings, he naturally compares his (Babur’s) justice
to a palace reaching up to the very heavens, signifying thereby
that the fame of that justice had not only spread in the wide
world but had gone up to the heavens.

2nd couplet :—In the second couplet, the poet tells who was
entrusted with the work of construction. Mir Baqi was evidently
some nobleman of distinction at Babur’s Court—The noble
height, the pure religious atmosphere, and the scrupulous clean-
liness and neatness of the mosque are beautifully suggested by
saying that it was to be the abode of angels.

3rd couplet :—The third couplet begins and ends with the
expression Buvad khair bagi. The letters forming it by their
numerical values represent the number 935, thus :—

B=2,0=6, d=4 total 12
Kh = 600, ag = 10,7 = 200 ,, 810
B=2,4=1,¢ =100,f=10,, 113

Total 935

The poet indirectly refers to a religious commandment
(dictum ?) of the Qoran that a man’s good deeds live after his
death, and signifies that this noble mosque is verily such a one,

6. The inscription outside the Mosque is as follows :—
BSay ile de SES x WS cen bile a SGI ey 4
ghe » shila. § x cpp tae gl dey ‘dba 39).
dipb e550 42 Sa >tcl pb ole ea

* Presumably the order for building the mosque was given during Babur’s stay i
Aid (Ajodhya) in 934AH. at which time he would be impressed by the dignity a
sanctity of the ancient Hirdii shrine it (at least in part) displaced, and like the obedie!
follower of Muhammad he was in intolerance of another Faith, would regard t
substitution of a temple by a mosque as dutiful and worthy. —The mosque was finishe
in 935AH. but no mention of its completion is in the Babur-nama. The diary fo:
935AH. has many minor /acune ; that of the year 934AH. has lost much matter,
breaking off before where the account of Aiid might be looked for.

V.—BABUR’S GARDENS IN AND NEAR KABUL. | Ixxix

1, Ba nam-t-anki dana hast akbar
Kt khilig-ijamla ‘alam la-makani
2. Duriid Mustafa ba'd az sitayish
Ki sarwar-t-ambiya dit jahani
3. Hasina dar jahan Babur qalandar
Ki shud dar daur gitt kamrani

The explanation of the above is as follows :—

In the first couplet the poet praises God, in the second
Muhammad, in the third Babur.—There is a peculiar literary
beauty in the use of the word 4¢-makani in the ist couplet.
The author hints that the mosque is meant to be the abode of
God, although He has no fixed abiding-place—lIn the first
hemistich of the 3rd couplet the poet gives Babur the appellation
of galandar, which means a perfect devotee, indifferent to all
worldly pleasures. Inthe second hemistich he gives as the reason
for his being so, that Babur became and was known all the world
over as a galandar, because having become Emperor of India
and having thus reached the summit of worldly success, he had
nothing to wish for on this earth.?

The inscription is incomplete and the above is the plain
interpretation which can be given to the couplets that are to
hand. Attempts may be made to read further meaning into
them but the language would not warrant it.

V._BABUR’S GARDENS IN AND NEAR
KABUL.

THE following particulars about gardens made by Babur in or
near Kabul, are given in Muhammad Amir of Kazwin’s Padshah-
nama (Bib. Ind. ed. p.585, p.588).

The meaning of this couplet is incomplete without the couplet that followed it and
is (now) not legible.

2 Firishta gives a different reason for Babur’s sobriquet of ga/andar, namely, that he
kept for himself none of the treasure he acquired in Hindiistan (Lith. ed. p. 206).


--- Page 366 ---
Ixxx APPENDICES.

Ten gardens are mentioned as made :—the Shahr-ara (Town-
adorning) which when Shah-i-jahan first visited Kabul in the
12th year of his reign (1048 AH.—1638 AD.) contained very fine
plane-trees Babur had planted, beautiful trees having magnificent
trunks,* — the Char-bagh,—the Bagh-i-jalau-khana,? — the
Airta-bagh (Middle-garden),—the Saurat-bagh,—the Bagh-
i-mahtab (Moonlight-garden),—the Bagh-i-ahi-khana (Garden-
of-the-deer-house),—and three smaller ones. Round these
gardens rough-cast walls were made (renewed ?) by Jahangir
(1016 AH.).

The above list does not specify the garden Babur made and
selected for his burial ; this is described apart (Zc. p.588) with
details of its restoration and embellishment by Shah-i-jahan
the master-builder of his time, as follows :—

The burial-garden was 500yards (gaz) long ; its ground was
in 15 terraces, 30 yards apart(?). On the 15th terrace is the
tomb of Ruqaiya Sultan Begam3; as a small marble platform
(chabiitra) had been made near it by Jahangir’s command, Shah-
i-jahan ordered (both) to be enclosed by a marble screen
three yards high.—Babur’s tomb is on the 14th terrace. In
accordance with his will, no building was erected over it, but
Shah-i-jahan built a small marble mosque on the terrace below.4
It was begun in the 17th year (of Shah-i-jahan’s reign) and was
finished in the 19th, after the conquest of Balkh and Badakh-
shan, at a cost of 30,000 777s. It is admirably constructed.
—From the 12th terrace running-water flows along the line
(rasta) of the avenue ;5 but its 12 water-falls, because not

t Jahangir who encamped in the Shahr-ara-garden in Safar 1016 AH. (May 1607 AD.)
says it was made by Babur’s aunt, Abii-sa‘id’s daughter Shahr-banii (Rogers and
Beveridge’s Memoirs of Jahangir i, 106).

_? A jalau-khana might be where horse-head-gear, bridles and reins are kept, bu
Ayin 60 (A.-i-A.) suggests there may be another interpretation.

3 She was a daughter of Hind-al, was a grand-daughter therefore of Babur, was
Akbar’s first wife, and brought up Shah-i-jahan. Jahangir mentions that she made
her first pilgrimage to her father’s tomb on the day he made his to Babur’s, Friday
Safar 26th 1016 At. (June 12th 1607 Av.). She died e¢. 84 on Jumada I. 7th 1035 AH.

(Jan. 25th 1626aD.). Cf. 7i2ik-2-jahangiri, Muh. Hadi’s Supplement lith. ed.
. 401.
i 4 Mr. H. H. Hayden’s photograph of the mosque shows pinnacles and thus enables
its corner to be identified in his second of the tomb itself.
5 One of Daniel’s drawings (which I hope to reproduce) illuminates this otherwise
somewhat obscure passage, by showing the avenue, the borders of running-water and
the little water-falls,—all reminding of Madeira,

constructed with cemented stone, had crumbled away and their
charm was lost; orders were given therefore to renew them
entirely and lastingly, to make a small reservoir below each fall,
and to finish with Kabul marble the edges of the channel and
the waterfalls, and the borders of the reservoirs—And on the
Oth terrace there was to be a reservoir II X I1 yards, bordered
with Kabul marble, and on the Ioth terrace one 15 X 15, and
at the entrance to the garden another I5 X 15, also witha marble
border.—And there was to be a gateway adorned with gilded
cupolas befitting that place, and beyond (feshk) the gateway
a square station,’ one side of which should be the garden-wall
and the other three filled with cells; that running-water should
pass through the middle of it, so that the destitute and poor
people who might gather there should eat their food in those
cells, sheltered from the hardship of snow and rain.?
t choki, perhaps ‘‘ shelter” ; see Hobson-Jobson s.7.

2 If told with leisurely context, the story of the visits of Babur’s descendants to
Kabul and of their pilgrimages to his tomb, could hardly fail to interest its readers.

ADDITIONAL NOTES

P. 16 1. 14. —Nizami mentions ‘‘ lover’s marks” where a rebel chieftain commenting
on Khusrau’s unfitness to rule by reason of his infatuation for Shirin, says,
“© Hinoz az‘ashigbasi garm dagh ast.” (H.B.)

P. 22 n. 2.—Closer acquaintance with related books leads me to delete the words
‘*Chaghatai Mughil” from Haidar Digh/a?’s tribal designations (p. 22, n, 2, 1.1).
(4) My ‘‘ Chaghatai” had warrant (now rejected) in Haidar’s statement (T.R.
trs. p. 3) that the Dighlat amirs were of the same stock (adza‘-7jims) as the
Chaghatai Khaqans. But the Dighlat off-take from the common stem was of
earlier date than Chingiz Khan’s, hence, his son’s name ‘‘ Chaghatai” is a mis-
nomer for Diighlats. (2) As for ‘‘ Mighil” to designate Dighlat, and also
Chaghatai chiefs—guidance for us rests ‘with the chiefs themselves; these
certainly (as did also the Begchik chiefs) held themselves apart from ‘* Mughiils
of the horde” and begs of the horde—as apart they had become by status as
chiefs, by intermarriage, by education, and by observance of the amenities jof
civilized life. To describe Dighlat, Chaghatai and Begchik chiefs in Babur’s
day as Mughils is against their self-classification and is a discourtesy. A clear
instance of need of caution in the use of the word Mughil if that of ‘Ali-shgr
Naw@i Chaghatai. (Cf. Abi’l-ghazi’s accounts of the formation of several
tribes.) (3) That ‘‘ Mughil” described for Hindustanis Babur’s invading and
conquering armies does not obliterate distinctions in its chiefs. Mughiils of the
horde followed Timirids when to do so suited them; there weré also in Babur’s
armies several chiefs of the ruling Chaghatai family, brothers of The Khan, Sa ‘id
(see Chin-timiir, Aisan-timir, Tikhta-bigha). With these must have been their
following of ‘‘ Mughiils of the horde ”.

P. 34 1.12.—‘* With the goshawks” translates girchigha bila of the Elph. MS.
(f. 126) where it is explained marginally by da éa2¢, with the falcon or goshawk.
The Hai. MS. however has, in its text, fz@27 dz/a which may mean with arrows
having points (Sazglakh f. 1446 quoting this passage). Ilminski has no answering
word (Aféms. i, 19). Muh. Shzrazi[p. 13 1.11 fr. ft.] writes da bazi miandakhtan.

P. 39.—The Hadibu’ s-styar (lith. ed. iii, 2171.16) writes of Sayyid Murad Aaghlagcht
(the father or g.f. of Yisuf) that he (who had, Babur says, come from the
Mughil horde) held high rank under Abi-sa‘id Mirza, joined Husian Baz-gara
after the Mirza’s defeat and death (873 a.H.), and (p. 218) was killed in defeat by
Amir ‘Ali Ja/air who was commanding for Yadgar-i-muhammad Shah-rukhi.

P. 49.—An Ama is a division of persons and not of territory. In Mongolia under
the Chinese Government it answers to khanate. A Khan is at the head of an
aimag. Aimags are divided into Zoshumg, z.e. banners (AZongolia, N. Prejevalsky
trs. E. Delmar Morgan, ii, 53).

P. 75 and n. 1.—For an explanation, provided in 944H., of why Samarkand was
called Baldat-i-mahfiza, the Guarded-city, see Daulat-shah, Browne’s ed. s.7.
Qulaiba p. 443.

P. 85 n. 2.—The reference to the Hadibw’s-styar confuses two cases of parricide :—
‘Abdu’!-latif’s of Aulugh Beg (853-1447) to which H.S. refers [Vol. III, Part 2,
p. 163, 1. 13 fr. ft.] with (one of 7-628) Shiritya’s of Khusrau Parviz(H.S. Vol. I,
Part 2, p. 44, 1. 11 fr. ft.) where the parricide’s sister tells him that the murderer
of his father (and 15 brothers) would eventually be punished by God, and (a little
lower) the couplet Babur quotes (p. 85) is entered (H.B.).

P. 154 n. 3. —The Persian phrase in the Szya@sat-nama which describes the numbering
of the army (T. dim kirmazk) is ba sar-t-tazidna shumurdan. Schafer translates
tazidna by cravache. I have nowhere found how the whip was used ; (cf. S.N.
Pers. text p. 15 1. 5).

P. 174 n. 1.—Closer acquaintance with Babur’s use of daryd, rad, si, the first of
which he reserves for a great river, casts doubt on my suggestion that darya
may stand for the Kasan-water. But the narrative supports what I have noted.

H. OF B. 58


--- Page 530 ---
878 ADDITIONAL NOTES

The ‘‘upper villages” of Akhsi might be, however, those higher up on the
Saihiin-darya (Sir-dary4).

189 and n. 1.—A third and perhaps here better rendering of 7 dag7 is that of
p. 662 (s.¢. April 10th), ‘‘leaving none behind.”

. 196.—The Habibi’s-styar (lith. ed. iii, 250 1. 11 fr. ft.) writes of daradaran of

Khusrau Shah, Amir Wali and Pir Wali. As it is improbable that two brothers
(Anglicé) would be called Wali, it may be right to translate darddaran by

brethren, and to understand a brother anda cousin. Babur mentions only the
brother Wali.

. 223 Il. 1-3 fr. ft.—The French translation, differing from ‘Abdu’r-rahim’s and

Erskine’s, reads Babur as saying of the ranges separating the cultivated lands of
Kabul, that they are comme des ponts de tréfle, but this does not suit the height
and sometimes permanent snows of some of the separating ranges.—My bald
“*(great) dams ” should have been expanded to suit the meaning (as I take it to
be) of the words Viir-inchaga pul-dik, like embankments ( fu/) against going
(yar) further ; (so far, zcha). Cf. Griffiths’ Journal, p. 431).

. 251.—-Nizami expresses the opinion that ‘‘ Fate is an avenging servitor” but not

in the words used by Babur (p. 251). He does this when moralizing on
Farhad’s death, brought about by Khusrau’s trick and casting the doer into

*~ dread of vengeance (H.B.).
R

266 n. 7.—On p. 266 Babur allots three daughters to Papa Aghacha and on p. 269
four. Various details make for four. But, if four, the total of eleven (p. 261)
is exceeded»

. 276 para, 3.—Attention is attracted on this page to the unusual circumstance that

a parent and child are both called by the same name, Junaid. One other
instance is found in the Badbur-nama, that of Babur’s wife Ma‘suma and her
daughter. . Perhaps ‘‘Junaid” like ‘* Ma‘siima” was the name given to the
child because birth closely followed the death of the parent (see s.7z. Ma‘sima).

277.—Concerning Bih-biid Beg the Skaibani-nama gives the following informa-
tion :—he was in command in Khwarizm and Khiva when Shaibani moved against
Chin S#f7 (910 au.), and spite of his name, was unpopular (Vambéry’s ed. 184,
186). Vambéry’s note 88 says he is mentioned in the (anonymous) prose
Shaibani-nama, Russian trs. p. xi.

. 372 1, 2 fr. ft.—Where the Hai. MS. and Kasan Imp. have mz‘araz, rival, E. and

de C. translate by representative, but the following circumstances favour
“rival”? :—Wais was with Babur (pp. 374-6) and would need no representative.
His arrival is not recorded ; no introductory particulars are given of him where
his name is first found (p. 372); therefore he is likely to have joined Babur in
the time of the gap of 924 aH. (p. 366), before the siege of Bajaur-fort and
before ‘Ala’u’d-din did so. The two Sawadi chiefs received gifts and left
together (p. 376).

. 393 1. 4.—In this couplet the point lies in the double-meaning of va ‘tyat, subject

and peasant.

. 401.—Under date Thursday 25th Babur mentions an appointment to read figahk

sabagi to him. Erskine translated this by ‘‘Sacred extracts from the Qoran”
(I followed this). But ‘‘ lessons in theology” may be a better rendering—as
more literal and as allowing for the use of other writings than the Qoran.
A correspondent Mr. G. Yazdani (Gov. Epigraphist for Muslim Inscriptions,
Haidarabad),tells us that it is customary amongst Muslims to recite religious
books on Thursdays.

. 404 1. 7 fr. ft.—Baba Qashga (or Qashqa)’s family-group is somewhat interesting

as that of loyal and capable men of Mughil birth who served Babur and
Humayin. It must have joined Babur in what is now the gap between 914 and
925 AH. because not mentioned earlier and because he is first mentioned in
925 aH. without introductory particulars. The following details supplement
Babur-nama information about the group :—(1) Of Baba Qashqa’s murder by
Muhammad-i-zaman Jéi-gar@ Gul-hadan (f.23) makes record, and Badayiini
(Bib. Ind. ed. i, 450) says that (cv. 952 AH.) when Baba’s son Haji Muh. Khan
Kuki had pursued and overtaken the rebel Kamran, the Mirza asked, as though
questioning the Khan’s ground of hostility to himself, ‘‘ But did I kill thy father



--- Page 531 ---
ADDITIONAL NOTES 879

Baba Qashqa?” (Pidrat Baba Qashga magar man kushta am?).—(2) Of the
death of Baba Qashqa’s brother ‘‘ Kiki”, Abi’l-fazl records that he was killed
in Hindiistén by Muhammad Sl. M. Bai-gara (952 Au.), and that Kiki’s
nephew Shab Muh. (see p. 668) retaliated (955 aH.) by arrow-shooting one of
Muh. SI. Mirza’s sons. This was done when Shah Muh. was crossing Minar-
pass on his return journey from sharing Humayin’s exile in Persia (see Jauhar).—
(3) Haji Muh. Khan X#z and Shah Muhammad Khan appear to have been
sons of Baba Qashqa and nephews of ‘‘ Kiki” (sugra). They were devoted
servants of Humiayiin but were put to death by him in 958 aH.-1551 Ap. (cf.
Erskine’s A. of J. Humayiin).—(4) About the word X#hi dictionaries afford no
warrant for taking it to mean foster-brother (Zokah). Chingiz Khan had a beg
known as Kak or Kouk (or Gik) and one of his own grandsons used the same
style. It may link the Baba Qashqa group with the Chingiz Khanid Kuki,
either as descendants or as hereditary adherents, or as both. (See Abi’l-ghazi’s
Shajarat-t-Turk, trs. Désmaisons, Index s.2z, Kouk and also its accounts of the
origin of several tribal groups.)

P. 416.—The line quoted by ‘Abdu’l-lah is from the Anwéar-z-suhaili, Book II,
Story i. Eastwick translates it and its immediate context thus :—

‘* People follow the faith of their kings.”

‘* My heart is like a tulip scorched and by sighings flame ; a

**Tn all thou seest, their hearts are scorched and stained the same.” (H.B)
The offence of the quotation appears to have been against Khalifa, and might be
a suggestion that he followed Babur in breach of Law by using wine.

P. 487 n. 2.—The following passages complete the note on w/sa quoted by Erskifie
from Col. Mark Wilks’ Historical Sketches and show how the word is used :—
“During the absence of Major Lawrence from Trichinopoly, the town had been
completely depopulated by the removal of the whole W2z/sa.to seek for food
elsewhere, and the enemy had been earnestly occupied in endeavouring to
surprise the garrison.” (Here follows Erskine’s quotation see zz loco p. 487).
‘*The people of a district thus deserting their homes are called the Wzlsa of
that district, a state of utmost misery, involving precaution against incessant war
and unpitying depredation—so peculiar a description as to require in any of the
languages of Europe a long circumlocution, is expressed 77 all the languages of
Deckan and the south of India by a single word, No proofs can be accumulated
from the most profound research which shall describe the immemorial condition
of the people of India with more precision than this single word. It is a bright
distinction that the Wz/sa never departs on the approach of a British army when
this is unaccompanied by Indian allies.”—By clerical error in the final para. of
my note #/vash is entered for #/vax [Molesworth, any desolating calamity].

P. 540 n. 4.—An explanation of Babur’s use of Shah-zada as Tahmasp’s title may
well be that this title answers to the Timirid one Mir-zada, Mirza. If so, Babur’s
change to ‘‘ Shah” (p. 635) may recognize supremacy by victory, such as he had
claimed for himself in 913 aH. when he changed his Timirid ‘‘ Mirza” for
** Padshah ”.

P. 557.—Husain Kashifi, also, quotes Firdausi’s couplet in tke Anwar-2-suhail
(Cap. I, Story XXI), a book dedicated to Shaikh Ahmad Suhail (p. 277) and of
earlier date than the Babur-nama, Its author died in 910 aH.-1505 Ap.

P. 576 n. 1.—Tod’s statement (quoted in my n. 1) that ‘‘the year of Rand Sanga’s
defeat (933 AH.) was the last of his existence ” cannot be strictly correct because
Babur’s statement (p. 598) of intending attack on him in Chitor allows him to
have been alive in 934aH. (1528 AD.). The death occurred, ‘‘ not without
suspicion of poison,” says Tod, when the Rana had moved against Irij then
held for Babur ; it will have been long enough before the end of 934 AH. to
allow an envoy from his son Bikramajit to wait on Babur in that year (pp. 603,
612). Babur’s record of it may safely be inferred lost with the once-existent
matter of 934 AH.

P. 631.—My husband has ascertained that the ‘‘ Sayyid Dakni” of p. 631 is Sayyid
Shah Tahir Dakni (Deccan?) the Shiite apostle of Southern India, who in
935 AH. was sent to Babur with a letter from Burhan Nizam Shah of Ahmad-
nagar, in which (if there were not two embassies) congratulation was made on

ADDITIONAL NOTES

the conquest of Dihli and help asked against Bahadur Shah Gujrati. A second

but earlier mention of ‘‘ Sayyid Dakni” (Zakni, Rukni ?) Shirazi is on p. 619.
Whether the two entries refer to Shah Tahir nothing makes clear. The
cognomen Shirazi disassociates them. It is always to be kept in’ mind that pre-
liminary events are frequently lost in gaps ; one such will be the arrivals of the
various envoys, mentioned on p. 630, whose places of honour are specified on
p- 631. Much is on record about Sayyid Shah Tahir Dakn7z and particulars of
his life are available in the histories by Badayini (Ranking trs.) and Firishta
Nawal Kishor ed. p. 105); B.M. Harleyan MS. No. 199 contains his letters (see
Rieu’s Pers. Cat. p. 395).

P. 699 and n. 3.—The particulars given by the 7ubagat-c-akbari about Multan at this

date (932-4 AH.) are as follows:—After Babur took the Panj-ab, he ordered
Shah Hasan Arghiiz to attempt Multan, then held by one Sl. Mahmid who,
dying, was succeeded by an infant son Husain. Shah Hasan took Multan after
a 16 (lunar) months’ siege, at the end of 934 AH. (in a B.N. /acuna therefore),
looted and slaughtered in it, and then returned to Tatta. On this Langar Khan
took possession of it (H.B.). What part ‘Askari (ef. 12) had in the matter is
yet to learn; possibly he was nominated to its command and then recalled as
