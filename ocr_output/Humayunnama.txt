PREFACE.

Ir was in October, 1900, that the late Mr. F. F. Arbuthnot
made arrangements with me for the publication of this
volume. It has now to put forth bereft of his guidance.
I can but trust that he would have given to the finished
work the welcome with which he greeted the small portion
I was able to show him in print. It is natural to feel
towards him what he has expressed in his dedication of
the Assemblies of Al Hariri to Chenery, and to hope he.
may be glad of the fulfilment of this piece of his work.

The little history which is reproduced in this volume has
few, if any, compeers, inasmuch as it is the work of a
Musalmani, and lights up her woman’s world. She writes
colloquially and without pose, and is unaffected and spon-
taneous. For these reasons I have tried to make an accu-
rate copy of her text, and to preserve her characteristics of
orthography and diction; and this the more that the
British Museum MS. may be her very own, unique, and
autographic. With a few chosen exceptions, I have repro-
duced all her deflections from common rule without com-
ment; my additions to the MS. are limited to a few izdfats
and other signs of which example is given at some place in
the MS..

Princess Rose-body has rendered one essential service to
history, by giving precise details of relationship in her own
and some contemporary families. Up till now, however,
_. no use has been made of her information, and her book
has remained, both in India and Europe, a literary parda-
nishin.

The Biographical Appendix, which I have modelled in
admiration of Professor Blochmann’s in his din-i-akbari,
will, I hope, be of use to future writers. It is the outcome
of the notes of several years, but it is incomplete and over
brief. Nevertheless, it discloses the elements of many a
romantic story. ;

One of an author’s most agreeable final touches is the
expression of thanks to those who have helped his book on
its way. My obligation to my husband is too great to be
told. Iam much indebted to Mr. A. G. Ellis for his un-
failing kindness during the long and pleasant time of my -
work in the British Museum, and to my friends Mr. E. H.
Whinfield and Mr. W. Irvine for the expression of their
opinions on several perplexing points. AsI have said in
writing of the plates, I owe all my illustrations but one to
Mr. Bourdillon, B.C.S..

The printing of a book so full as is this one of unfamiliar
names and of diacritically-marked letters entails a heavy
tax upon proof-readers and compositors. I wish to express
my sense of this, and to thank Messrs. Billing, their proof-
readers and their compositors for what they have done to
accomplish a difficult and tiresome task. My thanks are
indeed due and are offered to Messrs. Drugelin for the
patience and skill with which they have dealt with Persian
copy from my untrained hand.

I now venture to express, in Mr. E. Granville Browne's
words, the thought which haunts all who make a book, and
to beg my critics to listen to their plea:

‘Now, seeing that to fail and fall is the fate of all, and
to claim exemption from the lot of humanity a proof of
pride and vanity, and somewhat of mercy our common
need; therefore let suchas read, anderrors detect, either
ignore or neglect, or correct and conceal them, rather than
revile and reveal them.’

NOTE ON THE ILLUSTRATIONS.

THE page of the MS. selected for reproduction in Plate I.
contains several words which I have found difficult, and
concerning which explanation will be welcomed. It and
Plate No. II. make silent protest against printing, and
plead that the sun best shows the grace and beauty of
manuscript.

With the exception of the first illustration, all the plates
are photographic reproductions from a splendidly illustrated
Persian MS&., entitled the Tarikh-i-khandan-i-timiriya,
which is the choicest volume in the library with which
Maulvi Khiida-baksh Khan Bahadur has enriched the city
of Patna.!

The Emperor Shah-jahan appears to have paid R.8,000
for the illustrations in the volume. The MS. itself is of
older date, and Mr. Beveridge has found in it some portions,
at least, of the T'artkh-i-alfi. The title-page is wanting.

The volume has a further distinction, inasmuch as it
bears on an opening page an autograph note of Shah-jahan.
This is reproduced (as Plate No. II.) on the opposite page,
and by its charm and grace is worthy of that royal fount
of creative beauty.

The pictures of Babar’s devotion of himself and the triad
connected with the birth of Akbar are admirable; they
repay close attention and enlargement under a glass.

1 A copy of the Maulvi’s catalogue (published while he was Chief
Justice in Hydarabad) is in the British Museum, and may be con-
sulted for some details of the book. (p. 110) Mr. Beveridge also gives
some particulars about it in the R.A.S. Journal, January, 1901, p. 81.

I am indebted for these pictures, first to Mr. Beveridge
who, when he examined this Tarikh in 1899, thought of
my book, and, secondly, to Mr. Bourdillon, the then Com-
missioner of Patna, who most kindly photographed them
for us.

INTRODUCTION.

PART I.

BIOGRAPHICAL ACCOUNT OF THE PRINCESS AND HER
FAMILY.*

Section I.—Unper BAsar.

GuL-BaDaN Becam (Princess Rose-body) was a daughter of
Zahru-d-din Muhammad Babar, in whom were united the
lines of highest Central Asian aristocracy—namely, that
of Timir the Turk, through his son Miran-shah ; and that
of Chingiz the Mughal, through his son Chaghatai. He was
born on February 14th, 1483, and succeeded to his father’s
principality of Farghana when under twelve. He spent
ten years of early youth in trying to save his small domain
from the clutch of kinsmen, but, being forced to abandon
the task, went southwards in 1504 to Afghanistan, where
he captured Kabul from its Arghin usurpers.

Princess Gul-badan was born somewhere about 1523 and
when her father had been lord in Kabul for nineteen years ;
be was master also in Kunduz and Badakhshan; had
held Bajaur and Swat since 1519, and Qandahar for a year.
During ten of those nineteen years he had been styled
padshah, in token of headship of the house of Timur and of

1 In selecting from the mass of material which, without discursive-
ness, might have been included under the above heading, only that has
been used which concerns the begam or is in touch with her interests
and sympathies.

This Introduction corrects several errors which occur in an article
on the life and writings of the begam, and which was published by me
in the Calcutta Review, April, 1898.

‘his: independent sovereignty. To translate padshah, how-
ever, a8 is often done, by the word emperor would give a
wrong impression of Babar’s status amongst rulers at this
height of his rising fortunes. Nevertheless, Gul-badan was
born the child of a strong and stable chief, and of one who
was better followed in war than his nominal domains would
allow, because his army was drawn for the most part from
tribes not under his government, and was not territorial
and of Kabul but personal and inherited.

Babar says that he cherished the desire to conquer
beyond the Indus for nineteen years. At the date of
Gul-badan’s birth he was engaged in the attempt, and
succeeded when she was about two and a half years old.
He then became the first Turki sovereign in Hindustan, and
the founder of its miscalled Mughal dynasty.

If the princess had first seen light in London instead of
in Kabul, she would have had Henry VIII for king, and
the slumbers of her birth-year might have been troubled
as men marched forth at Wolsey’s will to fight and lose in
France. Her personal vicissitudes were the greater that
she was a Timirid and Turk. She spent her childhood
under her father’s rule in Kabul and Hindustan; her
girlhood and young wifehood shared the fall and exile of
Humayin ; and her maturity and failing years slipped past
under the protection of Akbar.

Her mother was Dil-dar Begam—the Heart-holding
' Princess—of whose descent, it is noticeable to observe,
neither her husband nor her daughter gives any informa-
tion. This peculiarity of omission she shares with Maham,
the wife of Babar’s affection and the mother of his heir;
and with Gul-rukh, the mother of Kamran and ‘Askari.
All three ladies are spoken of by our begam with the style
befitting the wives of a king; all were mothers of children,
and for this reason, if for no other, it seems natural that
something should be said of their birth. Babar frequently
mentions Maham, and calls her by this name tout court.
Dil-dar’s name occurs in the Tirki version of the Memoirs,
but not in the Persian, and she is there styled aghacha—

i.e, a lady, but not a begam, by birth. Gul-rukh is, I
believe, never named by Babar. This silence does not
necessarily imply low birth. It may be an omission of the
contemporarily obvious; and also it may indicate that no

one of the three women was of royal birth, although al. ——
seem to have been of good family.

Three Timtrids had been Babar’s wives in childhood and
youth. These were: ‘Ayisha, who left him before 1504
and who was betrothed to him when he was five; Zainab,
who died in 1506 or 1507 ; and Ma sima, whom he married
in 1507 and who died at the birth of her first child.
Maham was married in Khurasan, and therefore in 1506;
Dil-dar and Gul-rukh probably considerably later, and after
the three royal ladies had passed away from the household.
The next recorded marriage of Babar is one of 1519, when
a Yusufzai chief brought him his daughter, Bibi Mubarika,
as the seal of submission. She had no children, and was
an altogether charming person in the eyes of those who
have written of her.

To return now to Dil-dar. She bore five children, three
girls and two boys. The eldest was born in an absence of
Babar from Kabul and in Khost. This fixes her birth as
occurring somewhere between 1511 and 1515. She was
Gul-rang (Rose-hued), named like her sisters from the rose ;
then came Gul-chihra (Rose-cheeked); and then Abi’n-
nasir Muhammad, the Hindal of history, who was born in
1519; next was Gul-badan (Rose-body); and last a boy,
whom his sister calls Alwar, a word which looks like a
sobriquet drawn from the Indian town. He died after the
migration of the household to Agra, and in 1529.

Princess Gul-badan was born some two years before
Babar set out on his last expedition across the Indus, so
her baby eyes may have seen his troops leave Kabul in
November, 1525, for the rallying-place at Jacob’s Village
(Dih-i-ya'qub). It is not mere word-painting to picture
her as looking down from the citadel at what went on
below, for she tells of later watching from this view-point
which would give the farewell glimpse of the departing

army, and, as weeks and years rolled on, the first sight of
many a speck on the eastern road which took form as
loin-girt runner or mounted courier.

We who live upon the wire, need a kindled imagination
to realize what it was to those left behind, to have their
men-folk go to India. With us, fancy is checked by maps
and books, and has not often to dwell on the unknown and
inconceivable. To them, what was not a blank was probably
afear. Distance could have no terrors for them, because
they were mostly, by tribe and breeding, ingrain nomads ;
many of them had come from the far north and thought
the great mountains or the desert sands the desirable
setting for life. Such experience, however, would not help
to understand the place of the Hindus, with its heats, its
rains, strange beasts, and hated and dreaded pagans.

It is not easy to say wherein lies the pleasure of animating
the silhouettes which are all that names, without detail of
character, bring down from the past. Perhaps its roots
run too deep and close to what is dear and hidden in the
heart, for them to make way readily to the surface in speech.
But it is an undoubted pleasure, and it is what makes it
agreeable to linger with these women in Kabul in those
hours when our common human nature allows their
thoughts and feelings to be clear to us. Sometimes their
surroundings are too unfamiliar for us to understand what
sentiments they would awaken, but this is not so when there
is news of marches, fighting, defeat, or victory. Then the
silhouettes round, and breathe, and weep or smile.

Babar left few fighting men in Kabul, but there remained
a great company of women and children, all under the
nominal command and charge of Prince Kamran, who was
himself a child. His exact age I am not able to set
down, for Babar does not chronicle his birth, an omission
which appears due to its falling in one of the gaps of the
Memoirs. Babar left the city on November 17th, and was.
joined on December 8rd by Humayin at the Garden of
Fidelity (Bagh-i-wafa). He had to wait for the boy, and
was much displeased, and reprimanded him severely.

Hum§ayin was then seventeen years old, and since 1520 had
been governor of Badakhshan. He had now brought over
his army to reinforce his father, and it may well be that
Maham had something to do with his delayed march from
Kabul. She could have seen him only at long intervals —
since she had accompanied Babar, in 1520, to console and
settle her child of twelve in his distant and undesired post
of authority.

Shortly after the army had gone eastwards, disquieting
news must have reached Kabul, for three times before the
middle of December, 1525, Babar was alarmingly ill. What
he records of drinking and drug-eating may explain this;
he thought his illness a chastisement, and set himself to
repent of sins which were bred of good-fellowship and by
forgetfulness in gay company; but his conflict with them
was without victory. He referred his punishment to
another cause than these grosser acts, and came to regard
the composition of satirical verses as a grave fault. His
reflections on the point place him near higher moralists,
for he says it was sad a tongue which could repeat
sublime words, should occupy itself with meaner and
despicable fancies. ‘Ob, my Creator! I have tyrannized
over my soul, and if Thou art not bountiful to me, of
a truth I shall be numbered amongst the accursed.’ These
are some of the thoughts of Babar which lift our eyes
above what is antipathetic in him, and explain why he
wins the respect and affection of all who take trouble to
know him.

Not long after January 8th, 1526, a messenger would
reach Kabul who took more than news, for Babar had
found manuscripts in the captured fort of Milwat, and now
sent some for Kamran, while he gave others to Humayin.
They were valuable, but not so much so as he had hoped,
and many were theological. This and other records about
books remind one that they were few and precious in those
days. How many that we now rank amongst the best of
the sixteenth century had not yet been written! There was

no Tartkh-i-rashidi, and the very stuff of the Tuzik was
in the living and making.

On February 26th Humayin created news which would
be as welcome to Maham as it was to Babar, for he was
successful in his first expedition on active service. This
occurred at Hisar-firoza, and the town and district were
given to him with a sum of money. News of the victory
was despatched to Kabul from Shahabad ; and immediately
after Babar’s record of this in the Memoirs, there occurs a
passage of varied interest, although it seems to European
ears a somewhat strange commemoration of a detail of
toilette: ‘At this same station and this same day the razor
or scissors were first applied to Humayin’s beard.’ Babar
made an entry in June, 1504, of the same act accomplished
for himself. It was one which Turks celebrated by
festivity. The entry quoted above is made as though by
Babar, but it is followed by an explanation that it is
inserted by Humaytn in pious imitation of his father’s
own. Humayun did this in 1558-4, shortly before he set
out to recover his father’s lost domains in Hindustan.
The date is fixed by his statement that he made the inter-
polation when he was forty-six.

Humiaytn’s little victory would be dwarfed by the next
news of the royal army, for April 12th, 1526, brought the
battle of Panipat and the overthrow of Ibrahim Lodi Afghan,
the Emperor of Hindustan. The swiftest of runners would
carry these tidings to Kabul in something under a month.
On May 11th Babar distributed the treasures of five kings,
and left himself so little that he was jestingly dubbed
beggar (qalandar). He forgot no one, but sent gifts far
and wide to kinsmen and friends, and to shrines both in

1 There is a point of great interest about this note of Humaytin and
Mr. Erskine’s translation of it. I venture to refer readers who take
interest in the Memoirs, as a book, to my article on the Tiarki text of
the Memoirs (Royal Asiatic Society’s Journal, July, 1899), which
contains information gathered from some sources which were not at
Mr. Erskine’s disposition, and which suggest that another reading is
allowable to the concluding words (not mentioned in this text) of
Humiyin’s interpolation.

Arabia and ‘Iraq. Kabul was specially remembered and a
small coin sent for every soul within it. Gul-badan tells
what was given to the ladies, beginning with the great
begams, the aunts of frequent mention. It was certainly a
wonderful day when the curiosities and splendid things of
Hind were unpacked for their inspection, and very welcome,
too, would be the amir who escorted the precious caravan.
He was Babar’s friend, Khwaja Kilan, who had extorted a
most unwilling leave from India on the ground that his
constitution was not suited to the climate of that country, a
delicate assumption of blame to his own defects which it is
to be hoped he conveyed to the ladies as a reassurance.
After the gay social fashion of the time, no doubt he
helped the ladies to run day into night in the tale-telling
they loved. It appears probable that there was no such
complete seclusion of Tirki women from the outside world
as came to be the rule in Hindistan. The ladies may
have veiled themselves, but I think they received visitors
more freely, and more in accordance with the active life
of much-travelling peoples, than is the case in Hindu or
Moslim houses in India at the present day.!
The little Gul-badan will have had her present with the
rest, and probably, like some others, it was chosen by her
father specially for her. He sent a list with the gifts so -
that each person might receive what he had settled upon.
This he is said to have done both in allotting the jewels and
the dancing-girls, the latter of whom are mentioned as sent
to the great begams. Their novel style of dancing ranks
them amongst the ‘curiosities of Hind,’ but nothing is
said about their views of presentation to foreign ladies in
Kabul. Certainly Gul-badan will have seen them dance,
and she will also have enjoyed the joke played off by Babar
from Agra on an old dependent called ‘Asas (night-guard).

1 I remember a Muhammadan gentleman astonishing me by a story
of a Musalmani child who died of the shock to her propriety when she
was taken out from the faram. He was an ‘ English-educated’ man,
and the child was his sister.

This and all the begam’s stories are left for her to tell, as
she does later in this volume.

There came with the gifts an injunction which calls out
the remark, that at all crises Babar gave expression to
religious feeling and performed due devotional ceremonies.
He had desired Khwaja Kilan to arrange for the ladies to
go out of the city to the Garden of the Audience-hall, so
that they might there make the prostration of thanks for
the success of his arms. They were to go in state, and to
remain some days. He must have sighed as he planned an
excursion so much to his liking and in which he could not
share. The act of thanksgiving would be done under a
summer heaven, in an enchanting June garden, of which
the snowy hills were the distant girdle. Our princess will
have gone out with the rest, and with theirs her small
figure, bravely attired, will have bowed forehead to the
earth in thanks to the Giver of Victory. Tender thoughts
will have travelled to the absent, and especially to him who
loved his Kabul as Babar did.

It is remarkable in him that, longing to return home as
he did, he should have had endurance to remain and fight
on in Hindustan. His constitution was assuredly not
suited to its climate. His men hated it; his closest friend
- had left it; Humaytn and other intimates were soon to
follow the khwaja on leave; but he resisted all influences,
even when he had become so homesick that he wept at
sight of fruit from Kabul. Only love of action, desire to be
great, and capacity for greatness, could have held and
upheld him at his self-chosen post. It cannot be called a
small matter on which the history of hundreds of years
turns, and yet it was but the innate quality of one man, and
that man very human. Babar stood fast, and India had
Akbar and his splendid followers and all the galaxy of
their creations in sandstone and marble.

When Gul-badan was about two years old, and therefore
shortly before her father left Kabul, she was adopted by
Maham Begam to rear and educate. Maham was the chief
lady of the royal household and mother of Babar’s eldest

son; she was supreme, and had well-defined rights over
other inmates. Perhaps this position justified her in taking
from Dil-dar two of her children, Hindal and Gul-badan, as
she did in 1519 and 1525. Before 1519 Maham had lost
four children younger than Humayin; they were three
girls and a boy, and all died in infancy. So it may have
been heart-hunger that led to the adoptions she made, or
they might be the outcome of affection for Babar (it is
said she was to him what ‘Ayisha was to Muhammad),
which determined her, if she could not rear her children
for him, at least to give him his children with the stamp of
her love upon them. In some cases which are mentioned
by Babar, adoptions were made by a childless wife of
high degree from a slave or servant, but no such reason
seems behind those from Dil-dar. She is spoken of in
terms which preclude the supposition that (as Haidar puts
it in another place,) she was outside the circle of dis-
tinction.

The story of Hindal’s adoption is briefly this: In 1519
Babar was away from Kabul on the expedition which gave
him Bajaur and Swat, and which brought into the royal
household Bibi Mubarika Yusufzadi. On January 25th he
received a letter from Maham, who was in Kabul, about
a topic which had been discussed earlier between them—
namely, the adoption by her of a child of which Dil-dar
expected the birth. Now she repeated her wishes and,
moreover, asked Babar to take the fates and declare whether
it would be a boy or girl. Whether he performed the
divination rite himself, or had it done by some of the
women who were in camp with the army, (he speaks of it
as believed in by women,) it was done, and the result was
announced to Maham as promising a boy. The rite is
simple: Two pieces of paper are inscribed, one with a boy’s
name and one with a girl’s, and are enwrapped in clay and
set in water. The name first disclosed, as the clay opens
out in the moisture, reveals the secret. On the 26th Babar
wrote, giving over the child to Maham and communicating
the prophecy. On March 4th a boy was born, to whom


--- Page 27 ---

was given the name of Abi’n-nasir with the sobriquet of
Hindal by which he is known in history and which is
perhaps to be read as meaning ‘of the dynasty of Hind.’
Three days after birth he was taken, whether she would or
no, from Dil-dar to be made over to Maham.

It is clear that Dil-dar objected; and although the
separation could not have been so complete where the real
and adoptive mothers are part of one household as it is
under monogamous custom, it was certainly hard to lose

her firstborn son in this way. She had still her two elder
girls. Gul-badan was born four years later and removed
from her care at the age of two, by which date, it may be,
she had her son Alwar. In after-years Dil-dar, as a widow,
lived with Hindal, and she had back Gul-badan while the
latter was still a young and unmarried girl.

Babar was separated from his family for over three
years after he left Kabul in 1525. The tedium of waiting
for news or for his return was broken for the ladies by
several interesting home events, and by several items of
Indian news which must have stirred the whole community
in Kabul. On August 2nd, 1526, Maham gave birth to a
son who was named Fartgq, but he too died in babyhood
and his father never saw him. In December, 1526, there
occurred to Babar what must have roused anger and dread
in all Kabul, for he was poisoned by the mother of Ibrahim

1 The account of the adoption of Hindal is given in much abbreviated
form both by the Persian and English versions of the Memoirs. The
latter has, indeed, an error which is not borne out by the Persian; 1.e.,
it states that several children had been born in 1519. The correct
statement is that several had been borne by Maham younger than
Humayin. The Turki text of Kehr and Ilminsky has a longer account,
with curious details which may have been omitted on revision of the
Memoirs by Babar himself in later copies, or may have been omitted
by the Persian translator. The former is the more probable sugges-
tion, because if the full passage had occurred in the Elphinstone Turki
text used by Leyden and Erskine, it could not have escaped both these
careful workers. (This MS. is unfortunately not forthcoming for con-
sultation.) The point is of interest as bearing on the history of the
Turki texts. It makes for the opinion that Kehr’s source was one of
the early copies of the Memoirs, since the passage is one which from
its domestic nature would be less likely to be added to, than omitted
from a revised version.

Lodi Afghan. How Babar conveyed the news of this to his

people at home can be seen, because he has inserted the

letter he wrote to allay anxiety, as soon as recovered strength
permitted. Gul-badan has given the main points of the.
crime. ‘ She observes that Babar had called the ‘ill-fated ~~
demon,’ mother, and had shown her kindness, a sectional
view which leaves out the Afghan mourner, Buw’a Begam,
whose son had been defeated and killed, his dynasty over-
thrown, and herself pitied by the man on whom she tried
to avenge herself. Her fate is worth commemorating.
She was first put under contribution—1.e., made over for
the exploitation of her fortune to two of Babar’s officers—
and then placed in the custody of a trusty man for convey-
ance to Kabul. Perhaps she dreaded her reception there,
for she contrived to elude her guards in crossing the Indus,
threw herself into the water, and was drowned.

The letter above-mentioned is full of what one likes in
Babar. He quotes, ‘ Whoever comes to the gates of death
knows the value of life,’ and says, with thanks to Heaven,
that he did not know before how sweet a thing life is.
Here, too, he shows that he felt the tie which bound him
to the Power in whose hands are the issues of life and
death. He, his daughter, and his cousin and literary
compeer, Haidar Mirza Dughlat, frequently express religious
sentiment ; and here Babar exhibits the human graces of
kind thought and solicitude to lessen the anxieties of his
distant household and people. He forced himself to live
again, in words, the horrible experiences of which he wrote
while still in retirement, and four days! only after their
occurrence.

1 This letter bears date December 26th, 1526, and thus provides a
detail which is of use when considering the probable time of composi-
tion of the Memoirs. Was a copy of the letter kept? Did the
original return from Kabul? The impression given by points of
evidence is that the book was written down in present form later than
the date of this letter. There are in the beginning of it statements
which refer its composition or revised version to 1528. The same
point is raised by letters of 1529 to Humayin and Khwaja Kilan, the
date of which may indicate progress in the composition.

All the letters share another ground of interest, which is that, having

Three months later Kabul had news of an uplifting
victory, inasmuch as it had been won from men of alien
faith, whose overthrow was a plenary religious duty to the
Moslim. It was fought on March 18th, 1527, against
Hindi Rajputs under Rana Sanga, and at Khanwa, on the
skirts of the yet uncrowned hill of Sikri. It was preluded
by dread amongst the Musalmans, and by solemn acts
which should make them more worthy to be the tools
of Heaven and to enforce the stern belief that in battle
with the pagan there was vengeance of the cause of God.
Men declared repentance for sin and took oaths of
abstinence ; gold and silver drinking-vessels, probably of
Persian handicraft and artistic beauty, were broken up and
given to the poor; wine was poured out upon the ground,
and some was salted into vinegar. Where the libation of
penitence was offered, the earth was dedicated to the uses
of an almshouse with chambered well. So strengthened,
the Musalmans went into the fight and made great slaughter
of valiant foes.

The victory was followed by change in the personnel
of Babar’s army, which had long been wearying for home
and murmuring against Hindustan. This was especially
so amongst Humayiin’s Badakhshis, who were accustomed
to short service of one or two months, and it was now
almost sixteen since they had left even Kabul. Only
promise of immediate leave to follow had induced some
men to stay for this one fight, and they had been told that
when it was over, all who desired it should have freedom to
go. Many amirs had given ‘stupid and unformed opinions’
against remaining in Hindistan at all, and down to the
humblest followers these views had found acceptance. As
has been said, nothing would persuade Babar’s closest
friend to stay with him, although before his final decision

been composed in Tirki, they have been preserved in Tarki in the
Persian translation. This may be an act of pious deference. The
Memoirs were certainly altogether in Tirki, but they were not
addressed to individuals as were the letters. It is a fact of interest,
and open to pleasant interpretation.

was acted on, his master had called a council, and had
expressed himself with directness and vigour.

‘I told them that empire and conquest could not exist
without the material and means of war; that royalty and
nobility could not exist without subjects and dependent
provinces ; that by the labour of many years, after under-
going great hardships, measuring many a toilsome journey,
and raising various armies—after exposing myself and my
troops to circumstances of great danger, to battle and
bloodshed, by the Divine favour I had routed my formid-
able enemy (Ibrahim), and achieved the conquest of
numerous provinces and kingdoms which we at present
held. And now, what force compels, what hardship obliges
us, without visible cause, after having worn out our life in
accomplishing the desired achievement, to abandon and fly
from our conquests, and to retreat to Kabul with every
symptom of disappointment and discomfiture? Let anyone
who calls himself my friend never henceforward make
such a proposal; but if there is any among you who
cannot bring himself to stay, or to give up his purpose
of return, let him depart. Having made this fair and
reasonable proposal, the discontented were of necessity
compelled, however unwillingly, to renounce their seditious
purpose.’

After the Rajput defeat the time came for the promised
leave, but there is no mention in the Memoirs of a general
exodus. Humaytn went with his Badakhshis, and also, as
he seemed ‘ uncomfortable,’ Mahdi! Khwaja, Khanzada’s
husband. He, but not only he, had been through one hot
season in the plains and another was approaching,—a
discomposing fact, and one to wing the fancy and the feet
to Kabul. He, however, left his son Jafar in his govern-
ment of Etawa, and returned to India himself in 1528.

Humayin said farewell on April 16th, 1527, and betook
himself to Dihli, where he broke open the treasury and

stole its contents. If he had needed money to pay his
men, his act might have taken different colour and have
been leniently described; but he had had lavish gifts in
money and kind from Babar, and had been allowed to keep
the great diamond which the Rani of Gualiar had given
him as the price of family honour and which, there is good
ground to believe, is the Koh-i-nir. Treated as he had
been, his act was a crime, and base and mean. Perhaps it
may be set to the credit of the older Humayin that the
record of his theft has survived 1553-4 and his then perusal
and annotation of his father’s Memoirs. By that time he
had suffered many painful consequences of his own acts,
and may have concurred with his father’s judgment on his
younger self. Babar was extremely hurt by his unexpected
conduct and reproached him severely. There was enough
now known of Humaytn’s character to awaken doubt of his
fitness to rule, and to need all his father’s great affection to
veil and forgive. From Dihli he returned to Badakshan,
and is next heard of in the autumn of 1528, when he
announced the birth of his first-born son, Al-aman.
Al-aman was the child of that Bega (Haji) Begam of whom
the histories all speak, when in 1539 she is captured by
Shir Shah at Chausa.

Together with the news of Al-aman’s birth came that of
a marriage of Kamran with a daughter of Sultan ‘Ali
Begchik. Babar sent congratulatory gifts to both sons in
response; and he has included his covering letter to
Humayun in his text. It is frank, fault-finding, and
affectionate. It objects to the name given to the child;
it urges action: ‘The world is his who exerts himself’; it
objects to Humayin’s complaints of the remoteness of
Badakhshan, and tells him that no bondage is like the
bondage of kings, and that it ill becomes him to complain.
It attacks Humayin’s spelling and composition, and ends
this topic with words good to quote: ‘ You certainly do not
excel in letter-writing; and you fail chiefly because you
have too great a desire to show off your acquirements.
For the future, write unaffectedly, clearly, and in plain


--- Page 32 ---

15

words, which will give less trouble to writer and reader.’
Some remarks about Kamran have a coming interest;
Babar faintly praises him as a worthy and correct young
man, and enjoins favour for him, without a hint of suspicion
that it could ever be in Kamran’s power to show favour to ~s
Humayun. Huméayin is also desired to make friends with
Khwaja Kilan and with Sultan Wais of Kulab. He failed
with the khwaja, who on Babar’s death joined the worthy
and correct Kamran. Humayin kept on better terms with
Sultan Wais (Qibchdq Mughal), and at a later date owed
much to his daughter, the inimitable Haram (Khurram),
who stands up in history bold, capable, haughty, and
altogether strongly outlined.

Something must now be set down about Babar’s third
adult son, who was a younger full-brother of Kamran and
is known in history by his sobriquet of ‘Askari, which
indicates a camp as his birthplace. Neither his birth nor
Kamran’s igs mentioned in the Memoirs, as we now have
them,—an omission which other sources allow to be
explained by their falling in one of the gaps of the book. —
‘Askari was born in 1516 (922H.), and during a period of
storm and of camp life. His name first occurs in the
Memoirs as having presents sent to him after the battle of
Panipat, when he is classed with Hindal, as suited their
ages of nine and seven, and they received various gifts, and
not, like their two seniors, sums of money. In 1528 he
was in Multan, but there is no entry of an appointment,
perhaps because it would fall in the gap which extends
from April 2nd to September 18th. On the latter day he
was received, in home fashion, by his father in his
private apartments at Agra, and then, having spent till
December 2nd with him, he was furnished with munitions
of war for a campaign in the eastern districts. Special
injunctions were given to the officers to consult with him
as to the conduct of affairs. The interest of these details is
their relation to the boy of twelve. Few years were needed
in those days to support military command. Humayin
had gone to Badakhshan at eleven; Babar had been a


--- Page 33 ---

16

fighting king at twelve. Boy chiefs were common when
fathers were so apt to die by violent means; so were baby
figure-heads of armies such as that few-monthed Persian
baby who (like an angel’s semblance on an ancient battle-
ship) led his father’s army for Humayin’s help in 1544.

On December 12th other signs of dignity were bestowed
on the boy ‘Askari: not only a jewelled dagger, a belt, and
royal dress of honour, but the insignia of high command,

_ the standard, horse-tail, and kettle-drums; excellent horses,
ten elephants, mules and camels, the equipage of a royal
camp, and leave to hold a princely court and sit at the
head of a hall of state. The small boy’s mind is clear
to us about the horses, for where is the child of twelve
whom they would not delight? But what was in it about
the elephants? and how did he look when he inspected
théir bulky line ?

He bade farewell to his father on the 21st,—the Emperor
being in his bath, a statement which exhales the East,—and
after this, though there are many details of his cam-
paigning, nothing of living interest is set down in the
Memoirs about him. In the future he was Kamran’s
shadow, and displayed a loyalty to mother-blood which was
natural under the difficulty of being loyal to Humayan,
but which made him a Timirid foe to his house, who
initiated nothing and walked always in the bad path
marked out for him by the ‘ worthy and correct’ Kamran.

Coming back from this excursion into the future, to the
simple topic of Babar’s presents to his children, there can
be mentioned a set which is quite delightful in its careful
choice and appropriateness. It was sent to Kabul in 1528
for Hindal, and consisted of a jewelled inkstand, a stool
inlaid with mother-of-pearl, a short robe of Babar’s own,
and an alphabet. What could be better for the royal
schoolboy of ten ?

In 1528 an order was issued which brought about an
event of extreme importance to the ladies in Kabul,—
namely, that they should migrate to Hindustan. There
was delay in the execution of the royal command; and

17

having regard to the number of ladies, the difference of
opinion as to the advisability of going at all, discussion as
to the details of the journey, and also remembering that
(as the facts about the migration come out in the Memoirs, )
there would be many who thought their family interest
might be better served by remaining in Kabul, it is not
remarkable that there was delay in starting the cavalcade.

The migration: was amply dictated to many of the party
by Babar’s wish to see his own people again; but it is
clear that the enforced levée en masse of the ladies was a
result of considerations of policy and peace. The city was
full of women who, by birth or marriage, were attached to
various branches of the Timtrids, and there was conflict of
aims and palpable friction. It may well be that Kamran’s
government provoked unrest, because he was the son of a
mother of less birth than were very many of the resident
begams of Kabul.

The Emperor was put in full possession of the state of
affairs by a letter from Khwaja Kilan which reached him
in camp on February 6th, 1528, and which was brought by
a servant who, in addition to the written words, gave him
all the news of Kabul by word of mouth. Babar replied to
the khwaja on February 11th by that letter which those
who know the time and writer rank amongst the truly
interesting epistles of the world. The tenor of the khwaja’s
own is clear from it, and in part reply the Emperor
writes :

‘You take notice of the unsettled state of Kabul. I
have considered the matter very attentively and with the
best of my judgment, and have made up my mind that in
a country where there are seven or eight chiefs, nothing
regular or settled is to be looked for. I have therefore
sent for my sisters and the ladies of my family into
Hindustan, and, having resolved on making Kabul and all
the neighbouring countries and districts part of the imperial
domain, I have written fully on the subject to Humayun
and Kamran. ... Immediately on receiving this letter
you will, without loss of time, attend my sisters and the

2

18

ladies of my family as far as the Nil-ab (Indus); so that,
whatever impediments there may be to their leaving Kabul,
they must, at all events, start out within a week after this
arrives; for as a detachment has left Hindustan and is
waiting for them, any delay will expose it to difficulty, and
the country, too, will suffer.’

Who were these seven or eight chiefs in Kabul? Not
men! The fighting chiefs were almost all in India; even
Mahdi had rejoined the army before the date of this letter.
Babar’s word ‘sisters’ is a guiding light, and it does not
altogether exclude the influence of the men who, though in
Hindistan, were in touch with Kabul and its friction and
intrigues. First of sisters was Khanzada, who had certainly
a holding for her support ; and who had influence of birth
and personal, as having sacrificed herself in her earlier
marriage to secure Babar’s safety. She was now the wife —
of a man, Mahdi Khwaja, who, if the story told of him
by the author of the Tabaqat is true even in gist, was
such as to suggest him as a possible successor of Babar
to the powerful and sensible Khalifa. There was, since
her husband was with Babar and all great ladies had been
left in Kabul, Shahr-banu, Khanzada’s half-sister, wife of
Khalifa’s brother, Junaid Barlds, and mother of a son.
There was also, it is probable, another of ‘Umar Shaikh’s
daughters, Yadgar.?

Besides: Babar’s sisters de facto, there were others of
courtesy. Such was Sulaiman’s mother, whose anxieties
for his future were, however, about to find happy end by
his reinstatement in 1580 in his hereditary government of
Badakhshin. There were the families of three men of
Timtrid birth, grandsons of Sultan Husain Mirza Baygra,

1 Of the two others who are the complement in girls of his family,
it is safe to say that they were absent. Mihr-bant was the apparently
contented wife of an Uzbeg Sultan, and Ruqaiya, who, like Mihr-bant,
had been spoil of battle and an Uzbeg wife, was recently dead. Babar
says she died just when he was making the entries about her parentage
at the beginning of the Memoirs. This can hardly have been before
1528, because an appointment mentioned on the same page is recorded
on its occurrence as made in 1528.

19

all of whom were in India, and all of whom were men of
high pretension. They were,—Muhammad Sultan Mirza,
the arch-rebel of the future; Qasim Husain Sultan Mirza,
son of an Uzbeg father; and Muhammad-zaman Mirza,
son of Husain’s son, Badi‘u-z-zaman. There were in Kabul
the people of Yadgar-nasir also, Babar’s half-nephew.
These instances will suffice to show the reality of the
elements of unrest which conflicting family interests and
jealousies might and did foment in Kabul; they do not
include the many others furnished by Babar’s personal
circle, and by his numerous and influential aunts.

Two Timurid ladies, Fakhr-jahan and Khadija, both
paternal aunts of the Emperor, had gone to Hindustan so
early as November, 1527. With whom they went or why
they went is not recorded. The first was the wife of a
Tirmizi sayyid, member of a religious family with which
royal alliance was frequent, and she would find relations of
her husband in the army. The second, Khadija, has no
man mentioned as her husband, an omission by Babar and
Gul-badan which surprises, and which the chance word of
another writer may easily fill up. Perhaps these aunts
joined their nephew in response to his invitation of April,
1526, that kinsfolk and friends would come and see pros-
perity with him. They brought their children, and were
met outside the city by Babar on November 28rd, and by

_

him conducted in a lucky hour to their assigned palace! in

Agra. ;
Fakhr-jahan and Khadija stayed eleven months, and
were bidden good-bye before their return journey to Kabul
on September 20th, 1528. After all, Khadija did not go,
having affairs of her own to detain her, and this delay
allowed the Emperor to pay her another of the Friday
calls which he habitually made, during the time of his

1 Readers who are interested in the Tirki and Persian texts of the
Memoirs, will like to have attention drawn to the fact of there being a
record of this episode in one of the fragments attached to Kehr’s MS.,
and that this varies in detail from his text and from the Persian source
of the Memoirs.

occupation of Hindustan, on his elder kinswomen. On the
17th three sisters of Fakhr-jahan and Khadija arrived in
the suburbs and were welcomed. From all these Babar
could hear the news and gossip of Kabul, and thus add to
the impressions which led to his order for the begams to
join him in India.

Apropos of the aunts of frequent mention, it may be said
that both Babar and Haidar convey the opinion that defer-
ence to elder women was a permanent trait of their age and
set. Comings and goings of aunts are set down; houses
and incomes provided; advice is sought; troubles are
carried to them for sympathy; they are ambassadors of
peace; their nephews vie with one another as to who shall
-entertain them; in short, both the Tuzik and the Tarikh
indicate distinct deference to women of an elder generation.

A good deal about the exodus of the ladies can be

- gleaned from Babar and from our princess, who now comes
on the scene in her small person of five or six. The order
for it was given at latest in 1528; this is clear from the
royal letter to the khwaja and from the fact that Maham
started in January, 1529. Babar heard on March 22nd that
all had really left Kabul, which news, taken with the arrival
of the main cavalcade three months after her, suggests
that Maham started first and travelled quickly, as being
of a small company, and that the rest set off in detach-.
ments, as they and their transport were ready. The whole
party would get off between January 21st and the end of
February; this can be surmised, because the letter of
March 22nd would be about a month in reaching Babar.
Most of the journey would be made by horse-litter, and
some perhaps by palki with bearers. Men frequently
dropped down the Kabul River on rafts, being thus able to
do in twelve hours what ten marches covered; but one
cannot suppose the ladies would make this adventurous
journey, which was attended by risk even when people did
not fall off the raft after potations, as some of Babar’s com-
panions had done. Probably the road taken was that by
But-khak (Dust of Idols) and Jagdalik, and by Jalalabad

21

and the Khaibar ; but there is no certainty, because there
is no information.

Gul-badan travelled with Maham in advance of her
sisters, and thus had experiences all her own and a re-
ception by her father unalloyed by numbers. Her liveli-”
ness would while away the tedium of the five months’
travel, and help to distract Maham’s sad thoughts from the
loss of Faruq, her youngest born. Unfortunately, she sets
down nothing about the journey until near its end. Letters
between the Emperor and the travellers were frequent.
One of the couriers, named Shirak (Little Lion), who was
despatched by him on March 5th, carried not only letters
to Maham, but was entrusted with a copy of the Memoirs
which had been made to send to Samarqand.*

On April Ist, and at Ghazipair, Babar heard that the
ladies had been met at the Indus on February 19th by
their military escort under his master-of-horse, and by this
amir convoyed to the Chanab. This might fitly be told of
Maham’s party, for there are other records of covering the
distance to the Indus in about a month.

On the 22nd a servant of Maham brought letters to
Arrah from her whom he had left at the Garden of Purity
(Bagh-i-safa), near Pind-dadan Khan, and this is the last
such entry. Maham reached Agra on June 27th, and Babar
met her outside the city at midnight. ,

Gul-badan gives amusing particulars of her own arrival,
all of which she shall be left to tell. She followed Maham
into Agra on the 28th, not having been allowed to travel
with her through the previous night. Then she saw her
father. Of him she can have kept only a dim memory,
and it is likely enough she would stand in some awe of him
and his deeds, but no word he has written suggests that a

1 This is the earliest recorded copying of the Tarki text. This
Samarqand MS. and its descendants (if any) may have been written
up subsequently; but the points of this early transmission to Central
Asia of a copy and the variations of the Russian texts from those
found in India, are worth consideration. There is an unexplored MS.
in Bukhara of high reputation.

child needed to fear him, and she soon experienced ‘ happi-
ness such that greater could not be imagined.’ Happy
child! and happy father, too! who recovered such a clever
and attractive little daughter. It is not only her book that
lets us know she had a lively mind, but the fact of its com-
position at an age when wits are apt to be rusted by domestic
peace. Only a light that was strong in childhood would
have burned so long to guide her unaccustomed pen after
half a century of life, and only a youth of happy thoughts
and quick perceptions have buoyed her, still gay and
vivacious, across the worries and troubles of Humayin’s
time.

There were pleasant days after the coming to Agra,
when Babar took Maham, and the child also, to see his
works at Dholptr and Sikri. He had always been a
builder and a lover of a view, a maker of gardens and
planter of trees. Much of the scenery of his new location
displeased him; he thought the neighbourhood of Agra
‘ugly and detestable’ and ‘repulsive and disgusting,’ ’
words which do not now link well with that Agra which
he and his line have made the goal of the pilgrim of beauty.
It is difficult to go back in fancy to the city without a Taj,
with no Sikundra near and with Sikri uncrowned.

Dholpur and Sikri had much to show of work done by
the orders of the Emperor,—‘ my royal father,’ as Gul-
badan generally calls him, using the home word baba in-
variably. At Sikri, amongst other buildings, was that in
which she says he used to sit and write his book, i.e., the
Tuzuk. There, too, the great battle which had been
fought in 1527 will not have been ignored to ears so sym-
pathetic as Maham’s. Perhaps here the little girl first
learnt dimly what it was to be a Ghazi, and to fight on the
side of Heaven. She says that when these excursions had
been made, and three months after her own arrival had
sped by, the begams, with Khanzada as their chief, came
within meeting distance of the capital, and that the
Emperor went out to welcome them. There is nothing
of this in the Memoirs, which are silent after the arrival

of Maham as to the doings of the royal ladies. The reunion
was soon to be clouded by anxieties and loss.

A brief return in the story of Humayun must be made
here. In the summer of 1529 he heard in Badakhshan
of his father’s failing health, and, without asking leave, ———
set off for India. He passed through Kabul, and there,
to Kamran’s surprise, met him, who had just come up
from Ghazni. The two conferred, and persuaded the
ten-years-old Hindal, who was under orders for Agra,
to take up the government of Badakhshan. Humayun
then continued his march, and arrived in Agra without
announcement to his father.

He came to the presence just when, by a coincidence
which Maham may have helped to bring about, his parents ©
were talking of him. It would be natural for the mother,
who cannot have been ignorant of her son’s coming, to
stir gentle thoughts of him and to warm his father’s heart
towards him before they met, and by this“to break the
shock of the unpermitted absence from duty.

Babar was greatly angered by the desertion, which in
truth placed Badakhshan in difficulty by withdrawing both
troops and control. Its consequences were important, and
caused him profound regret. To stand fast across the
mountains and to push out the royal holdings beyond the
Oxus from the vantage-ground of Badakhshan was a
cherished dream, and one which he had taken steps through
both Humaytn and Kamran to realize. He wished Huma-
yun to return to his post, but the latter, while saying he
must go if ordered, was not willing to leave his people
again. Babar then asked Khalifa to go, but this request
was evaded, and there is much to arouse surmise that
Khalifa saw in it the act of someone who wished him
absent from the scene of crisis now foreseen as near. In
his objection to leave Agra, affection for his old master
would be a natural factor; another was his own supreme
influence, the sequel of his character and of Babar’s recent
failure in health; and springing from his power was,
perhaps the dominant factor of his objection to leave,—a

24

disposition to supplant Humayun in the succession by a
ruler of less doubtful character.

The fate of Badakhshan was decided by its bestowal on
its hereditary chief, Sulaiman Mirza, Mirdn-shahi, now a
boy of sixteen, while Humayun’s youthful locum tenens was
ordered to come to India. Humayin betook himself to the
idle enjoyments of his jagir of Sambhal, and was there, in
a few months, attacked by illness which threatened life and
which led to the remarkable episode of Babar’s self-sacrifice
to save him. The narrative of this stands in all the
histories and need not be repeated, but for the sake of
making our princess’ details clear, it is as well to state
what was the rite performed by Babar.

There was and is in the East belief that if offering be
made of the thing most precious to the suppliant, and if
the offering be accepted, Heaven will give the life of a sick
man in exchange. The rite observed is simple: first prayer
of intercession is made; then the suppliant walks three
’ times round the sick man’s bed. Of Babar’s sincerity
there is no doubt; in mind and heart he gave himself; he
felt conviction that, after the circuits, he had borne away
the illness. Humayun was restored and Babar died,—a
return from the gate of death and an entry there which
might have occurred without Babar’s rite, but none the
less was the self-sacrifice complete because he believed in
its efficacy and was willing to die.

His health worsened rapidly after this and he made
ready to go. Marriages were arranged for Gul-rang and
Gul-chihra; the amirs were addressed; Humayun was
counselled and named to the succession. Babar died on
December 26th, 1530. ‘Black fell the day,’ says his
daughter; ‘we passed that ill-fated day each in a hidden
corner.’

The question of Khalifa’s wish to supersede Humayun is
of great interest. It is written of by Nizamu-d-din Ahmad,
in the Jabaqat, who had the story he retails from his
father, Muqim, an old retainer of the Court. Abi’l-fazl
repeats the main statement, which is that Khalifa had had

thoughts of superseding Humayun by Muhammad Mahdi
Khwaja, the husband of Khanzada Begam.!

A few of the many points involved in Nizimu-d-din’s
story find fitting entry here. Babar must have been long _
conscious of the fact that he was not so strong as before he
faced the Indian climate; he did not send for Humayun ;
he wished him to leave when he came unasked; he had
“Askari in the full dignity of a commander near him; as
he lay dying, he was fretfully anxious for Hindal’s coming ;
he and Khalifa were friends of many years’ testing; both
knew the faults of Humayun; if Khalifa had planned to
set the latter aside, it is likely that the thought was not
altogether absent from the mind of Babar; it is not credible
that Khalifa should have regarded a supersession as
practicable, if he had no acquaintance with the Emperor’s
doubts as to Humayun, and without knowing that these
were shared by others than his master and himself, for
the nomination would be made by Babar and to his
chiefs.

Muhammad Mahdi Khwaja is one of those men about
whose birth and descent particulars are looked for with the
sure hope of success in the search. Yet nothing is said
on the topic by Babar or by Gul-badan. When he first
appears on the scene (in the Persian version, and presumably
also in the Elphinstone text), he is not introduced, as it is
customary for Babar to introduce, with some few words
indicating family. This omission may be a result of
forgetfulness bred of familiarity, or it may be, and most
probably is, that he himself first met Muhammad Mahdi at
a date which falls in one of the gaps of his book.”

Nizamu-d-din’s statements must have some corn of truth,
and they imply that by birth, as well as by marriage and

1 Neither of the sources thus describes Mahdi, but a somewhat full
consideration of the several Mahdis of the time allows no other than
the husband of Khanzada to be understood by the name Mahdi
Khwaja of the two sources. Cf. Appendix, s.n. Muhammad Mahdi.

2 This omission, and perhaps some others, are straws pointing to the
existence, at some time, of material which would fill the gaps.

iwilitary rank, Mahdi was a man who, without outrage,
might be raised still higher.. There are hints which make
it seem probable that he was a Tirmizi sayyid and the son
of a Timurid mother. The suggestion of Tirmizi parentage
is supported by the burial of Abu’l-ma‘ali Tirmizit in the
place of interment of Mahdi and Khanzada.!
- It has suggested itself to me as possible that Khalifa’s
plan of superseding Humayun was meant to apply only to
Hindustan, or at least to a part of Babar’s dominions.
Abu-sa'iid had partitioned his lands amongst his sons;
provinces so varied as Babar’s seem to demand division
even more than his grandfather’s had done. We look back
to Babar across Akbar’s Indian Empire, and may not give
sufficient weight to the fact that Dihli and Agra were not
the centre or the desired heart of Babar’s. He wanted
Farghana and Samargand and much more beyond the
Oxus, and he had taken decisive steps towards securing
his object through both his elder sons, and had given them
charge and work of extension in those countries. Kabul
was the true centre of his desired empire, and to force
the Uzbegs back in widening circle was his persistent
wish.

If Mahdi or any other competent man had ruled in
Dihli, by whatever tenure, this would not necessarily have

1Tt is singular that both Khalifa and Mahdi disappear from
prominent place with the death of Babar. From Gul-badan it is
known that the latter was living at the time of Hindal’s marriage
with his sister Sultanam in 1537, because she names his gifts to the
bridegroom. A good deal of search has failed to disclose other
particulars of action or death of either man after Humayiin’s acces-
sion. Khalifa’s brother, Junaid (like Mahdi, a brother-in-law of
Babar), fought faithfully for Humayin till his recorded death.
Khalifa was older than Junaid, and the impression given by the early
part of the Memoirs is that he was older than Babar. The difficulty
of the obvious interpretation of the silence about Khalifa’s later life
is, that he withdrew support from Mahdi’s promotion, and it is dis-
tinctly said of Humayiin by Badayuni that he was made emperor by
the concurrence of Khalifa. So there would be no ground for a con-
spiracy of courtly silence about him. He was probably dead before
the exile of the Timirids from India in 1540, because his wife Sultanam
was with the royal household, and made her pilgrimage shortly after
the exodus to Sind.

ruined Humayun, or have taken from him the lands most
coveted by Babar. All Babar’s plans and orders were such
as to keep Humayun beyond the Hindu-kush, and to take
him across the Oxus. The dislike of the royal army to
Hindustan was a large factor in the question of centralizing
government there, and so too would be the temptations to
indolence afforded by its climate and customs, to which it
was easy to foresee from Humayun’s life in Sambhal that
he would readily succumb.

Kabul was made an imperial domain by Babar’s written
command to both elder sons, and his own words leave one
in doubt as to his further intentions about it. To whom
Hindustan would have been given if Humayun had obeyed
orders and had held fast in Badakhshan, there is nothing
to show, but weight is due to the gist of the story of the
supersession. Kamran declared that Kabul was given to
his mother Gul-rukh, and Humayan gave it in fief to
Kamran at his accession. There is mist over the scene
from which only the accomplished facts emerge. Humayin
came to India; he was Maham’s son; she was there;
Khalifa let Mahdi fall; Humayun’s personal charm reas-
serted itself over Babar’s anger, and he became Emperor
of Hindustan and all the imperial domains.

Child though Gul-badan was at her father’s death, she _
must have been impressed by the events that preceded it:
Alwar’s death; her own accident at Sikri; her father’s
premonitions and dervish-moods; Humayin’s sudden
arrival and the anger it caused; his illness and the dread
for his life; her father’s awe-inspiring rite and its bewilder-
ing success; her sisters’ marriages, which could not be
joyful; the haunting suspicion of poison; the end and the
blank,—all too-much for so short a time in strange scenes
and in a disabling climate.

Following the death came the forty days of mourning,
and of good works and gifts at the tomb in the Garden of
Rest at Agra. Sikri furnished a part of the endowment
for its readers and reciters, and Maham sent them food
twice daily from her own estate. The tomb was put under

the guardianship of a man whom our begam calls Khwaja
Muhammad ‘Ali ‘asas (night-guard), and who may be he
that ‘never killed a sparrow,’ and may be Maham’s brother.
If so, he will be heard of again under other and widely
different circumstances in 1547. As is well known, Babar’s
body was conveyed to Kabul, and there laid to rest in the
spot chosen by himself.

Section I].—Unper HvumAvtn.

In Babar’s history the man holds the interest and lifts
the eyes over his shortcomings to his excellence. No
character demanding admiration attracts interest to
Humayun, but yet his story is one which it needs a master-
hand to unfold. A Tolstoi could depict his faults and
merits ; his qualities and defects rolled a tide of retribution
over him and those bound to him as surely and visibly as
it does over Anna Karénine and her associates. From the
historic standpoint, Mr. Erskine has told the tale in a way
to hold his readers, and it befits this humble introduction
to build up only such framework as will support details,
some of which concern the ladies of the time, and others
of which may interest readers who are not Orientalists.

In order to realize how fully the fate of the ladies was
involved in that of the Emperor, it must be remembered
that his occupation of Hindustan was unrooted, military
and the sport of war. When we in Britain have to lament
a reverse of arms, we do it in safe homes and we brace
ourselves to what will come next, in the familiar surround-
ings of the daily tradesman, the usual postman, and the
trivial comforts of the hearth. Even Colonials had a
refuge under the flag at measurable distance from their
outraged homes in 1899-1900. But when the Timirids
were defeated in 1539-40, and driven from Agra and Dihli
and Lahor, there was no refuge open to all. Their
head, Humayin, had none; a brother took his last.
Like the Israelites, he and his followers then wandered in
deserts and hungered and thirsted; dwelt in strange lands,

pursued and attacked, exiled and humiliated. The course

of events was less historic than biographical, was individual

and not national. There were no nations behind Babar

and Humayun; there were only ruling families who came

and went as they could or could not get the upper hand of |
other houses; and there was the dumb mass whom the
earth nourished, and labour of whom fed, in luxury of life

and strength of alien arms, whatever dynasty had just
struck hardest.

An enumeration of the chief events of the downfall of
Humayun and of his years of exile will give our required
framework. He became Emperor in December, 1530. In
the next year Kamran took possession of Lahor and the
Panjab, in addition to his grant of Kabul, and he was
allowed to remain in possession of these wide and potential
lands. In 1533 there were rebellions of the ‘ mirzas.’ By
1535 Gujrat had been overrun, and in 1537 was lost.
Years of indifference fostered the growth of Shir Shah
Afghan’s power, and there were campaigns against him in
Bengal, which began well and ended ill. There was growing
indignation against Humayun’s character and private life,
and this culminated in the attempt to set him aside for
Hindal in 1539. Through months of indolence and folly,
he dropped oil on his own descending wheels, and prac-
tically abdicated the throne; finally, there were the
crushing reverses of Chausa on June 27th, 1539, and of
Kanauj on May 17th, 1540. Then came the flight of the
Timurids to Lahor, and their exodus from the lands that
had been theirs east of the Indus.

Maham was spared the worst of these misfortunes ; she
died before Hindal’s marriage, which Jauhar places in
1537. Her son had certainly addicted himself to drugs
before her death, but his worst lapses into sloth followed it,
and it was after 1537 that the pace of his descent became
rapid. Much can be learned from our princess of the
reaction of outside events on the inner circle, and she
gives details which could only be gathered in that circle.
_ This is particularly so as to Hindal’s rebellion and the

home conference about it, and about the murder in his
name, but not by his act, of Humayun’s favourite, Shaikh
Bahlul. Gul-badan, like the good sister she was, makes
excuses for her brother, and those who have not her bias of
affection, can add others and stronger. Hindal was nineteen,
a good and successful young general; he was supported by
men of rank and age, some of whom had come from Gaur,
and had seen Humayun’s army perishing in that sink of
fever and corruption, and Humayun buried within its walls.
There was no ruler in Hindustan; Shir Shah was between
Humayin and the capital. The ‘mirzas’ were lifting up
their heads again, and a chief was needed. Hindal was
perhaps always the best of Babar’s sons in character, and
certainly so when Humayun had become the changeling of
opium. He had the Friday prayer (khutba) read in his
own name; and on his behalf, Nuru-d-din Muhammad, a
son-in-law of Babar and grandson of Sultan Husain Baygqra,
murdered Shaikh Bahlul. The motive of the crime appears
to have been desire to place the death as an impassable
barrier between the royal brothers.

The news of Hindal’s rebellion stirred Humayun to move
from Gaur. His march to Agra was broken off tragically
by the rout at Chausa, where he lost 8,000 of his best
Turki troops by sword or river. Here Ma'suma was
widowed, and here a terrible blank was made in the royal
household by the loss of several women. Bega’s (Haji
Begam) capture is known to all the histories, and so, too,
is her return to Humayun. Shir Shah promised safety to
all women found in the camp, and there is no reason to
doubt that he did his best for them. But there had
been fighting round their tents before his guards arrived,
and some of Humayun’s amirs had perished in trying ©
to defend them. It came about that there were losses of
women and of children as to whose fate no word was ever
heard again. Amongst them was ‘Ayisha Bayqra, the wife
of Qasim Husain Sultan Mirza. The next name in our
begam’s list takes us far back. It is that of Bachaka,
a head-woman-servant (khalifa), and one such and so

named had escaped from Samargand with Babar’s mother
in 1501. The one lost at Chausa had been a servant in
Babar’s household, and may have been she of the memor-
able siege. Next are named two children, a foster-child and_
Bega’s ‘Aqiqa of six years old. Two of Humaytn’s wives
of low degree also disappeared.

When Humayun had been rescued from the river by a
lowly water-carrier, he made way to Agra, and there had
a conversation with Gul-badan about the loss of ‘Aqiqa.
The princess was then seventeen years old, and a comment
of his, which she sets down, lets it be known that she is
now a married woman. Humayun told her he did not
recognise her at first, because when he went away with the
army (1537) she wore the tag, and now wears the lachak.
The téq is a cap, and the lachak,—a wife’s coiffure—is
a kerchief folded crossways, tied under the chin by two
corners, and capable of much more elaboration and orna-
ment than this simple description would lead one to
suppose. This is Gul-badan’s nearest approach to in-
forming her readers of her marriage, and she never
mentions her husband as such. He was her second
cousin, Khizr Khwaja Khan, Chaghatai Mughal, and of the
line of the Great Khans. His father was Aiman Khwaja,
and his mother a cousin of Haidar Mirza Dughlat. One
ancestor was that Yunas whose fate as a chief of nomads
was in such entertaining contrast to his taste as a lover
of cities and books. Khizr had many other noteworthy
kinsfolk, but to tell of them would lead too far afield. It is
useful, however, to say that Gul-rang and Gul-chihra had
married two of his uncles, and that his brother Yasin
(Hasan or Ais)-daulat, the Fair Sultan, became the hus-
band of Kamran’s Habiba. He had two other brothers
in India, namely, Mahdi and Mas‘ad. Their father and
one at least of them came from Kashghar to Agra just
after the death of Babar.

Shortly after this interview Humayun took the field
against Shir Shah, and Kamran, deserting his post, left
Agra and led off his 12,000 troopers towards Lahor. Under


--- Page 49 ---

his escort went an immense convoy of women and helpless

“people, and he wished to take Gul-badan also. She was
extremely unwilling to go and only partially resigned her-
self when she saw that it was Humayun’s will. She
bewailed herself as parting from those with whom she had
grown up, and no uninitiated reader could guess that she
was going with her father’s son. She was a clever and
attractive girl whose society was welcome to all her
brothers, but in Kamran’s wish to take her now there is
something more. It is possible that he who liked her,
thought of her safety; it is probable that, as he had
attached two of her husband’s brothers, Yasin-daulat and
Mahdi, and perhaps the third, Masud, he desired to have
Khizr too. Gul-badan’s departure from the home circle
was perhaps her first adventure into the foreign world as
a married woman. By going when she did and under the
escort of Kamran’s strong force, she was spared a terrible
journey which her mother and the rest of the royal party
made under care of Hindal, with foes in front and behind,
and at great peril.

There now followed that amazing battle at Kanauj, in
which 40,000 men in armour fled, without a gun fired, before
10,000. Here again, as at Chausa, the deaths in the river
were appalling, and here again the Emperor was saved by
a lowly man. Again the remnant made its way to Agra;
but, says Haidar, ‘we made no tarry; broken and dispirited,
in a state heart-rending to tell, we went on to Lahor.’
Their road took them to Sikri, of which the memories and
witness to Babar’s genius for living must have rubbed salt
into the wounds of their spirit. Many ladies had remained
in Agra, and Humayin spoke to Hindal of the difficulty of
getting them safe to Lahor, and confessed that he had often
regretted not killing “Aqiqa with his own hand. - Hindal
combated the suggestion, born of defeat, that a mother and
sisters should be killed, and himself fought his way through
country folk and Afghans, and convoyed them safe to
Lahor.

Here was a mighty gathering of Timtrids and their

following, and five months slipped by in uncertain counsels
and fruitless talk. The four brothers met often to discuss
plans, and it.seems that the emptiness of this in practical
result lay in what was in the mind of Kamran and made
him object to every course proposed. He wished to make ———
terms for himself with the daily approaching victor, and
to keep Lahor and the Panjab; but if this could not be,
he meant to hold fast to Kabul and keep Humayun out
of it. The fief of Kabul had been granted to him by
Humayun; Humayun therefore could resume it. That he
would now do so was Kamran’s expectation; so, when
Humayun proposed to go to Badakhshan, Kamran would
not hear of it, because the road thither lay through Kabul,
and once in that beloved city, it was highly improbable
that Humayun would move further.

On October 30th, 1540, something decisive had to be
done, for Shir Shah had crossed the Biah and might
appear at any hour. ‘It was like the Day of Resurrection,’
says our princess; the confusion was extreme, and, like
the simile, impossible for us to realize. It has been said
that 200,000 souls left Lahor in flight on that day; an
overtax of all resources of transport.

Happily for the fugitives, the Ravi was fordable, but the
Chanab required boats and the Jehlam was in flood. Many
episodes unfolded themselves in the dudb of the Ravi and
Chanab. Haidar Mirza took his departure for Kashmir,
hoping to secure in it a royal retreat; Hindal and Yadgar-
nasir deserted and went south for Multan; Humayun was
urged to put further mischief out of Kamran’s power by ‘ —
his death; he refused,—a refusal which would be upheld
in the haram, ever faithful to the injunctions of Babar,
and knowing these better than the real risks caused by
Kamran’s disloyalty. Penetrating everything was the
irritation aroused by Kamran’s opposition to the royal
march for Kabul,—irritation which diffused itself and barely
missed a sequel of bloodshed.

The depression and gloom of the men who were the
responsible leaders of the fugitive mob must have been

8

34

deep and painful; but what was in the minds of their
dependents,—the ordinary troopers, the helpless women,
the comfortless children, and the camp-followers ?

There were many striking scenes in the lives of Babar
and Humayitn, but none more dramatic than that in which
the latter’s flight through the Panjab ended. A little
west of the Jhelam, at Khushab, the road runs through
a ravine of an outlying spur of the Salt Range. Beyond
this it forks, north-west for Kabul and south-west for Sind.
Kamran asserted his intention to enter the defile first,
perhaps with the object of closing the Kabul road. Hu-
maytn insisted on his right to take precedence, and
blows threatened between their followers. Mediation was
made by Abua’l-baqa, the man who had led Babar to offer
himself for his son in 15380. He directed Humayun’s
attention to the superior force of Kamran, and he told
Kamran that it was the right of Humayun to take prece-
dence. In the end Humayun marched first and took
the southern road. At the fork of the ways each com-
mander and many a man must have made or confirmed
his choice between the brothers. And so the mighty
caravan split itself, and followed Kamran and ‘Askari or
Humayun.

With the Kabul section many women went to the safer
asylum. They had no choice to make where the roads
parted, but those of them who saw their litters turn south-
wards and themselves carried by a strange road, of which
they knew that it took them from the old home in Kabul,
must have had some bitter feelings about their destiny. I
believe Gul-badan went with Kamran. She does not say
80, but it comes out with tolerable clearness incidentally.
Her mother, Dil-dar, had gone with Hindal to Multan, and
with her was Hamida-banu, Akbar’s mother to be. Khan-
zada seems to have gone with Humayan, for her niece
mentions her later as an ambassador from him in Sind to
Qandahar. No other writer speaks of this embassy, I
think; but most tell of her other, made later from Kabul
to Qandahar in the service of peace between Kamran and

85

Humayun, after the latter had returned from his Persian
exile (1545).

Khigr is not mentioned as with Humayun in the desert
wanderings, but he was in Qandahar with ‘Askari in 1545.
On the occasion of her reunion with Humayun in Kabul,
in 1545, Gul-badan says that there had been a ‘toil and
moil of separation ’ lasting five years. The lustrum points
to a farewell said at the Jhelam. One thing makes for her
having gone with the royal party, and this is her lively
account of what befell it; but she is equally lively about
Persia ; where she certainly did not go. She had excellent
opportunity of hearing what went on in Sind because she
met her mother again in 1548, after she had come to Kabul
from Qandahar. She also met Hamida in 1545, and could
hear from her not only about her wedding, concerning
which she has such an excellent passage, but also about her
visit to Persia. There was ample and easy opportunity for
the two old companions to talk over the past and to refresh
their memories when the book was being written in and
after 1587 and when they were comfortably installed as the
beloved and respected ‘Beneficent Ladies’ of Akbar. More-
over, Gul-badan has a note of acknowledgment to Khwaja
Kisik for help derived from his writings, as to the early part
of the royal wanderings. There is therefore nothing to
contradict the probability that she continued under Kamran’s
protection from 1540, the date of her unwilling departure
from Agra, till 1545, when Humayin took Kabul.

During the lustrum in which she did not see Humayun,
his adventures were too many and too remarkable for
abbreviation in these pages. Mr. Erskine has told them
with evident enjoyment, and Gul-badan supplements his
narrative with some material he did not use; it may be
interjected here that he had no knowledge of her book. For
most of the period of the exile in Sind and Persia, Hamida
was a good authority, and more than once Gul-badan has
prefaced a statement with ‘Hamida-banu Begam says.’
She was one in the cruel desert march to Umarkot; it
will have been from her that the princess heard that

8—2,

Akbar’s birthplace was a beautiful spot where food was
very cheap; she was one of the little band which fled from
Quetta; she shared the qualified hospitality of the Persian
king, and, it should be said, reproduced only a sense of
good treatment by him; and she came back to Qandahar
with his auxiliary army.

In Kabul Gul-badan did not want for old friends and
kinswomen. She had her own home occupations and her
children to look after; of these, though she names one
only, Sa adat-yar, she may have had several; but there is
no definite statement as to which of Khizr’s children were
also hers. She was not unkindly treated by Kamran, as were
the other royal ladies whom he turned out of their usual
homes and exploited in purse. Indeed, he wished to regard
her as one of his own family and to distinguish between
her and her mother; but of this she would not hear.

In 1548 she had again the society of Hindal who, after
losing Qandahar to Kamran, came as a prisoner upon parole
to Kabul and his mother’s house. The movements of
Humaytn were made known from Sind to Kabul with
speed and completeness, and the news was acted on to
Humayun’s great detriment. There were domestic reasons
why Shah Husain Arghin should not be well disposed to
Humayun, besides the substantial one of the latter’s entry
and long occupation of his country. Of the more intimate
causes of ill-will one was inherited ; Babar had dispossessed
the Arghuns from both Kabul and Qandahar, and not only
so, but had given in marriage to his foster-brother Qasim
an Arghun girl, Mah-chtchak, daughter of Muqim Mirza.
This was a great offence, because it was a misalliance in
Arghun eyes and because it was enforced and the bride was
spoil of battle. The story of her anger and of her rebellion
at her fate is delightfully told by Mr. Erskine, and to his
pages readers may be safely referred for the sequel of my
brief allusion to it.

When Qasim kitka died, Mah-chachak married her cousin,
Shah Husain, and she was with him during Humayun’s
miserable stay in Sind.

37

Another cause of friction lay in the presence of a former
wife of Husain with Humayin’s household. In 1524
Husain had allied himself with Khalifa’s family by marry-
ing his daughter Gul-barg. As the fact adds to the——_
domestic complication, it may be mentioned that at the
same time Husain’s stepdaughter, Nahid, the child of
Qasim and Mah-chtchak, married Khalifa’s son, Muhibb-
‘ali. Husain and Gul-barg (Rose-leaf) did not get on well,
and she left him after what Mir Ma‘stm calls two years of
wedded life. She then, says the same author, went to India
with Jannat-ashyant (Humayun) ‘previous to the /itrat.’
This last word is frequently used of the rout at Chausa in
1539, but the next nearest catastrophe to which it would
apply after 1524 is the death of Babar, because Gul-barg is
named by Gul-badan in Humayiun’s household shortly after
his accession. She was with him in Sind in 1541 onwards,
and so, too, was Sultanam,! who was perhaps her mother,
and both were unlikely to make the best of Shah Husain to
Humayun.

In 1545 Kabul heard that Humayin was on his way back
from Persia with the Shah’s army behind him. A first
result of this was to bring the little Akbar within reach of
Khanzada and to her charge. All the histories tell of his
wintry journey from Qandahar taken with Bakhshi-banu,
the one being under three and the other about four. Their
coming adds a touch of tenderness to the historic Khanzada,
who paces through the histories sad and wise and trusted.
She kissed the baby feet and hands of Akbar, and declared
they were the very hands and feet of Babar, and that he
was like him altogether. Her first marriage with Shaibani,
had been made to save Babar from captivity or death. She
was divorced because suspected of leaning to his side when
his interests conflicted with her husband’s, and she had
been restored to him (1511) when she was about thirty-

her to go to Makka and take her daughter also, gives the impression
that Khalifa is dead.

three years old... To the reader’s fancy she wears a
mourning garb; she is mentioned with deference, and is a
dignified figure in the turmoil of her day. Her third
marriage,—she was doubly widowed at Merv,—takes an
impersonal colour, as an alliance which her age, story and
loss of her only son make seem rather one contracted to
confer honour and afford her a safe home, than on any
-ground of personal affection. She bore Mahdi no child;
she adopted his sister Sultanam at the age of two, and
reared her to become the wife of Hindal.

By March 21st Humayun was besieging Qandahar, and
he then sent an envoy to Kabul, who would be a welcome
guest as teller of the events since Humayin had left Quetta
in 1548. This was Bairam Khan Baharli, and with him
went Bayazid biyat. Bairam saw Akbar, and could take
back to Hamida news of his welfare; and also a number
of princes who were kept in Kabul under Kamran’s eye.
These were Hindal, Yadgar-nasir, some of the ‘ mirzas,’
Sulaiman, Haram and Ibrahim.

Bairim spent six weeks waiting till Kamran should
choose his course now that he knew his brother was the
stronger ; and when he left the city, he was accompanied by
Khanzada, charged to mollify Humayin and smooth the
way for ‘Askari when the latter should submit. She went
into Qandahar, but her presence did not bring about the
immediate surrender, and the weary siege carried on its
burden of suffering. Many of the amirs of the defence
began to slip away; the two Khizrs, Hazara and Cha-
ghatai, dropped themselves over the wall. The first got

, away to the mountains with adventures which fit a High-
land setting; the second sought Humayun and obtained
forgiveness.

Qandahar was surrendered on September 8rd, and ‘Askari
and his amirs came out with swords hung round their

necks, and some having winding-sheets in their hands.
He was forgiven, and a feast with wine and talk and music
sped the night away. While ‘Askari was gay with the rest,
someone laid before him his own letters to the Biluchi__
chiefs of whom Gul-badan tells, urging them to capture
Humayun when he was in flight from Quetta. This was
Humayun’s revenge.

Meantime Kamran was in singular isolation in Kabul.
He heard of the fall of Qandahar, of the move of the royal
army for Kabul, of the death of the travel-worn Khanzada,
and of the escape of some of his princely détenus. He
was depressed and irritable. He sent troops out to meet
Humayun, but there was no fighting, and he fled by way
of Ghazni to Sind. Then came the end of the ‘toil and
moil’ of separation, and Gul-badan met her brother again
after five years, on November 15th, 1545. For awhile
there was peace and festivity in Kabul. Hamida followed
the army in the spring; she had now a second child, a
girl, born in Persia, and she took possession once more of
her first-born. Humayun wished to see if Akbar, whom
his mother had had to desert at Quetta when he was
fourteen months old, would remember her now. He had
him taken into a room in which a number of ladies had
assembled and seated him on the masnad. The child
recognized Hlamida, and made his way to her arms.
Abua’l-fazl, who tells the story, gives all the credit of the
recognition to the boy; but to those not dazzled by the
light in which Akbar lived for his historian, it seems
extremely probable that the child had some help from the
smile which he had known as one of the first happy things
of life.

In the spring, too, Humayun set out on a campaign in
Badakhshan. He sent word back to the governor of Kabul,
Uncle Muhammad ‘Ali, that he was to strangle Yadgar-
nasir, who had been tried and condemned to death for
treachery. The khwaja declined the office. ‘How should
I kill the mirza, I who have never killed a sparrow?’ This
uncle (fayhaz) seems a mild man for his post. Another

executioner was found, and the mirza ‘ was relieved of the
pains of existence.’

Humaytn took ‘Askari with him as a precautionary
measure. Of the ladies, Mah-chichak went, and in atten-
dance, Bibi Fatima, the chief armed woman of his haram
and mother of Zuhra, whom Hamida’s brother was to
marry and murder. Near Khishm Humayun fell alarm-
ingly ill and lay unconscious for four days. He had nurses
at hand whose excellence is attested by the annals, and it
adds life to the scene to know that the long watch over the
unconscious man was broken by his opening his eyes just
when Mah-chichak was dropping pomegranate-juice into
his mouth. He recovered, but it was a perilous time for
him and his supremacy, and had a bad sequel. -

News of the illness went to Sind, and Kamran, reinforced
by his father-in-law, Husain, hurried up and seized Kabul.
Winter was at its depth on the passes, and the amirs with
the royal force were anxious to get back to protect their
families. They had premonitions that he would take the
city again, and many slipped away in small parties and
went to Kabul, where they found all their anticipations and
dread justified. It does not seem right to stigmatize their
leaving Humayun as traitorous; they had their own people
to save, and this might be done by slight show of submis-
sion to Kamran. No one can consider Humayun a man who
had claim to fidelity when the lives and honour of wives and
children were in the balance. Indeed, to have left Kabul
under the charge of Muhammad ‘Ali was to court disaster,
and to make reasonable a good deal of independence of
action in those whose unarmed people he could not protect.

Every fear of the amirs was justified. On his northward
march Kamran passed through Ghazni, where Zahid Beg
was governor. He it was who when offered a Bengal
appointment in 1538, had asked Humayan if he could not
find another place to kill him in. He had not waited for
a reply, but had left Bengal, and helped Hindal to rebel
in Agra. Kamran now answered his question in Ghazni,
and after this murder hurried off towards Kabul. ‘It was

morning, and the Kabulis were off their guard, and grass-
cutters and water-carriers were going in and out as usual.
Mirza Kamran went in with all these common people.’
So speaks the princess. The gentle-hearted governor was——__
at the hamam, and was brought before Kamran, without
time given to dress, and there and then sabred. The list
of other ‘cruelties and murders is too terrible reading for
these pages, and the ensuing siege was full of barbarous
acts. Humayun crossed the passes as soon as it was
practicable, and sat down to take the city. When Kamran
saw at length that he could not hold it, he escaped through
a hole fashioned in the wall, got through the trenches and
away to the mountains. Some say Hindal let him pass
the royal lines; others that Haji Muhammad Khan kiika
overtook him later (so destitute that he was being carried
by a man), and that Kamran appealed to their milk-
brotherhood and was allowed to go free. He then joined
his hereditary foes, the Uzbegs.

In 1548 Humayun entered upon a campaign in Badakh-
shan which yielded interesting personal matters, such as
this rivulet of the great stream of affairs can convey. He
left Kabul on June 12th, and Hamida bore him company
with Akbar as far as Gul-bihar. As governor this time a
soldier, and a man enraged against Kamran, was left in
charge of Kabul. The campaign culminated in the capture
of Taliqan, which was made over on August 17th by
Kamran, who was allowed to go to the refuge of all
whose presence was undesired at home, Makka. Piety
had no part in Kamran’s intention to betake himself to the
holy city, and when he had heard, with incredulous ears,
that Humayun was meting out mercy without justice to the
revolted amirs he had captured, he took heart and himself
asked forgiveness. It is almost incredible, and would be
quite so if one did not know Humayun, that he was
received with kettle-drums, trumpets, tears and pardon.
Certainly Humayun never deprived himself of the luxury
of tears and the loose rein on his feelings. So wonderful
was the following scene that Mr. Erskine’s words shall tell


--- Page 59 ---

42

it: ‘When Kamran approached the Emperor, who was
sitting in state in the pavilion of public audience, he took
a whip from the girdle of Munim Khan, who stood by, and
passing it round his neck, presented himself as a criminal.
“* Alas, alas !’’ exclaimed the Emperor, “there is no need
of this; throw it away.’’ The mirza made three obeisances,
according to the usual etiquette of the Court, after which
the Emperor gave him the formal embrace and commanded
him to be seated. Kamran began to make excuses for his
past conduct and to express his regret. ‘‘ What is past is
past,” said the Emperor. ‘‘ Thus far we have conformed
to ceremony; let us now meet as brothers.” They then
rose and clasped each other to their breasts in the most
affectionate manner, and both burst into tears, sobbing
aloud, so as to affect all present. Humayun, on resuming
his seat, desired his brother to sit next to him on the left,
the place of honour, adding kindly in Turki, the language
of the family, ‘‘ Sit close to me.” A cup of sherbet was
brought, of which the Emperor, having drunk one half,
handed it to his brother, who drank the other. A grand
entertainment followed, at which the four brothers (also
Sulaiman), who now met for the first time after a long
separation, sat on the same carpet and dined, or, to use
the words of the historian, ate salt together. The festival
was prolonged for two days in the midst of universal
rejoicing. As Kamran, from the rapidity and hurried
nature of his return, had left his tents behind him on
the road, the Emperor ordered a set to be pitched close
to his own, and, at his desire, consented to ‘Askari’s going
to stay with him.’

For this historic feast Gul-badan has provided a hors
@euvre in shape of a story of improper conduct in
Sulaiman which, if it expressed derision, as her vague
wording does not forbid to be read, was fully justified by
both what had been and what was to come. It is a very
funny little tale, and readers are commended to it.

To tears and professions were added lands and freedom.
Kamran received Kulab, where Haram Begam’s father had

once ruled for Babar and Humayun. He was now dead,
and his son, Chakr ‘Ali, was left with Kamran there. The
mirza was not pleased with his fief. ‘What!’ he exclaimed
to the bearer of the deed of grant, ‘have I not been kin
of Kabul and Badakhshan? Kulab is a mere district of
Badakhshan. How can I serve in it?’ The bearer
observed that he had heard Kamran was wise, and begged
permission to remind him that the wonder was he had
received anything at all. ‘Askari, too, was given a fief,
and then, leaving them neighbours and at large, Humayun
went back to Kabul in October, 1548.

A campaign was planned for 1549 against the Uzbegs
and Balkh. This was done despite marked instability in
the royal following. Instability or, in a plainer word,
desertion, was an accident to which Humayun was pecu-
liarly liable. One cause of it is more interesting than the
common one of personal gain, because it is rooted in
theological bias. Humayun’s coquetry with Shiism in
Persia is one of the most entertaining of the episodes of
his sojourn there, and it had consequences in arousing
distrust of him, which cropped up from time to time.
Babar himself had lost ground because of his tolerance to
variety of faith. But to this, both in the father and still
more in the son, were added, as causes of desertion, the flux
and reflux of weak government which forbid men to know
who will keep the upper hand and have power to oppress.

To return to the Balkh campaign: spring was waited
for and there was delay for men. Spring came, and the
minds of the ladies turned to thoughts of excursions out of
town. They remarked more than once to Humayun that
the riwdj would be coming up in the hills. This is a
plant of subacid flavour which some say is like sorrel and
some like rhubarb. It was, at least, a plant that people
made excursions to eat, much as others go blackberrying.
To these hints for change, the royal reply was that the
army was going out; that it would pass by the Koh-i-
daman (which is renowned for its riwdj); and that the
ladies should go too. Gul-badan must not be deprived of


--- Page 61 ---

44

her story of the picnic, which illuminates the domestic
ways of the court. The ladies went so far as to see the
waterfall at Farza, and perhaps even to Istalif, twenty
miles north of Kabul, and then returned.

There had been bad omens for the start and there
followed plenty of bad news from the front to fix attention
on them. Kamran broke his promise to come to Humaytn’s
help. Gul-chihra’s second husband, an Uzbeg prince, ran
away when he came to know that the army was directed
against his people. There was an extraordinary retreat
without an enemy, and of which the cause seems to have
been fear that, as Kamran was not there, he was oppressing
Kabul. Humayun was left almost alone, and the Uzbegs
attacked and killed many fugitives. His horse was
wounded and the whole affair was a fiasco. After all, too,
when Kabul was reached, there had been no sign of
Kamran.

It was the expected that Kamran should not keep his
word, but perhaps the unexpected was behind his conduct
on the occasion of the Balkh campaign. Sulaiman and
Ibrahim were with Humayun, and their presence might
well have kept him away, for Gul-badan tells of an in-
cident in which the three men had part and which did
not make them good company for one another. It is a
bit of scandal to which Haram adds salt and vitality. It
is repeated here because some little points do not quite
stand clear in the begam’s wording. While Kamran was
in Kulab—i.e., his last holding,—someone, who from her
name of Tarkhan Begam must have been a woman of
good birth, advised him to make love to Haram Begam.
Good, she said, would come of it. So Kamran sent a
go-between with a letter and a kerchief to Haram, who,
furiously angry, at once summoned husband and son
from wherever they were away from home, and told them
of the advances made to her. She railed at Sulaiman,
saying that it was clear he was thought a coward, and
further observed that Kamran feared neither her nor
her son. Much was packed in the pronoun here; there


--- Page 62 ---

45

was ground to fear the energetic and resolute woman who

had the army of Badakhshan at her disposal. She was

a forceful person and had the go-between torn to pieces.
Kamran was audacious, and his advances look the more sQ____
that Haram’s sister was his wife; but they may have been

made rather to the charms of her army than to those of its
commandante.

The events of 1550 sum up in Jauhar’s words: ‘ Mirza
Kamran wandered about the country with bad intentions.’
In his course he surprised Humayun in the Qibchaq defile,
and an engagement took place which was attended by great
loss of life. It was witnessed by Kamran’s wives and
daughters from a commanding height. Bayazid mentions
that the ladies wore turbans (dastar-basti), a detail which
may have been suggested by the great heat of the weather.
Why the women were on the scene is perhaps explained
by a similar record in the Memoirs which concerns a wife
of Sultan Husain Baygrd. Shahr-banu, a daughter of
Sultan Abu-sa‘id Mirza, was, with Husain’s other wives,
present at a battle between her husband and her brother,
Mahmtd Mirza. She did not, as the other ladies did, leave
her litter and mount a horse, so as to be ready for flight if
necessary, but trusting to her brother, in the case of her
husband’s defeat, remained comfortably in her litter while
the fight went on. This dispassionate composure so much
offended Husain that he divorced her. Perhaps Kamran’s
family, too, had prepared for whatever was to be their fate
by protecting themselves against the sun and by being
ready to mount.

In this encounter Humayun was badly wounded. Gul-
badan was able to hear the details of the misadventure,
because Khizr Khwaja was with her brother and, it may
be said, fighting against his own, Yasin-daulat. Khizr
and Mir Sayyid Birka Tirmizi helped to hold the wounded
man up on an ambling pony when he could not sit his
horse, and so they led him out of the fray, sustaining his
courage as they went by tales of other princes who had
come through plights as bad. The wound was on the head,


--- Page 63 ---
Courtesy www.pdfbooksfree.pk

46

and was like one of Babar’s in that it was given through
@ covering turban and this was uninjured. The pain was
great and caused faintness. Humayin took off his quilted
coat and gave it to a servant. The man finding its weight
an encumbrance, left it lying; it was taken to Kamran,
who posted off with it to Kabul, showed it as evidence of
death, and once more took possession of the unfortunate
city.

Jauhar has quaint stories of the destitution in which
Humayin now was, with his camp equipage lost and
deprived of all necessaries. He was helped along through
the night, cold and weakened, and in the morning was
placed in safety by the arrival of a body of reliable troopers
under Haji Muhammad kiika. He warmed himself in the
sun, washed his wound, said his prayer kneeling on a
scarlet stool, and borrowed a coat from a servant to replace
his own, which was blood-stained. Then came an old
woman of the place and offered him a pair of silk trousers,
that he might discard his blood-stained ones. He accepted,
while saying they were not fit for a man’s wear, and
remitted her taxes for life. This was drawing well in
anticipation of the time when his account in those regions
would stand to his credit.

It is said that while he sat with his face still to the qibla
one of his followers, Sultan Muhammad garawal, performed
again for him the rite his father had observed, and expressed
his willingness to die for him. Humayan spoke reassuring
words and comforted his faithful sacrifice.

For nearly three months Kabul believed Humayin dead.
These words cover much feeling, sad and joyful ; but there
is no one to tell the truth and say whether it was thought
by some to offer better hope of peace that Humayun should
be dead. There was always a large following of powerful
officers ready to join Kamran, and one cannot suppose their
changes in allegiance mere folly and fickleness. But no
courtly author has told Kamran’s side of the whole matter,
nor his view of his own position.

AT

He was kept safe through all the vicissitudes of his father’s
career, and was well cared for both by Kamran and by
‘Askari. It has been said that on one occasion Kamran
exposed him on the battlements of Kabul to his father’s
guns, and this charge finds support from our princess. She
however, it may be observed, makes no mention of the act
attributed by some writers to Maham anaga, of interposing
her own body to shield the child; indeed, she never once
mentions this latterly influential woman. But this incident
notwithstanding, it must be admitted that the boy was well
treated. “Askari’s wife, who took charge of him after his
capture at Quetta, is said to have been most kind to him.
He was entrusted by Kamran to Khanzada, itself an act of
surety and kindness. Again and again he fell into his
uncle’s hands when Kamran was exasperated by foiled
attempts to keep Kabul, and yet he survived. Kamran
had a son; it would have surprised no one to learn that,
as complement to his effort to ousi Humaytn from his
higher place, he had killed Akbar to give his own son
more chance. In this there is what fixes attention in the
same way that it is fixed by Gul-badan’s record of Kamran’s
anxiety to obtain from the elder ladies of his house
sanction to have the khutba read in his name. It was
in his power to have himself proclaimed ruler in Kabul,
but he discussed his wish to be so proclaimed with the
other members of the royal family before he did it, and
the discussion was prolonged, and referred from Dil-dar to
the greatest of the ladies, Khanzada. In both these points

there is something which, if better known, might mitigate
' the sweeping judgment usually passed upon Kamran as
altogether wrong in all his doings.

Humayun spent some time in Ander-ab while his wound
was healing and his army gathering, and here Haram
comes again upon the scene. Where Sulaiman and Ibrahim
were, is not quite clear, but it was to Haram a message went
asking her for the army of Badakhshan. It was to come
as quickly as possible, and fully equipped. It took the
energetic woman only a few days to put some thousands of

48

men in the field. It was she, says our princess, who did it
all, took thought, and overlooked everything. Then she
led the men to ‘the pass,’—amongst so many possible, one
cannot fix on which,—and having done her work, went
home. It seems probable that Sulaiman and Ibrahim were
already with Humayun, and that Haram despatched a
supplementary force. The battle in which it was to engage
was that important fight at Ushtur-gram which Humayun
tried hard to prevent by previous mediation, and which
was forced on by Kamran’s chief officer, Qaracha Khan.

There was much previous discussion as to terms of peace,
but Kamran and Qaracha would have nothing less than
Kabul. A second embassy offered alliance of the ‘unique
pearl of the khilafat,’ Akbar, with the mirza’s ‘dear
daughter’ (who may be ‘Ayisha), and that Kabul should
be theirs ; and suggested that Humayun and Kamran should
join forces and again attack Hindustan. All came to
nothing, because Qaracha cried, and enforced his cry, ‘ Our
heads or Kabul.’ The battle that followed was a complete
success for the royal arms, and to add to its good results,
Akbar, of whose safety there had been doubt, was brought
to Humaytn’s camp. His father vowed charitable gifts
for his restoration, and also that he would never part from
him again.

A pleasant chance befell Humayun on the stricken field,
for when he had claimed, as his share of booty, two
driverless camels, he found in their loads his own books
which he had lost at the Qibchaq defile. Many would be
MSS. of the Persian poets; Babar knew these well and
often quotes the Gulistan; and Humayun was too much of
a dilettante and verse-lover not to have made himself
familiar with their round.

Happily the tale of the doings of Kamran is drawing to
a close. He made a night attack, by which Hindal lost his
life, on the royal forces on November 20th, 1551; sued
for help in vain from Salim Shah, the Emperor of
Hindustan; from Adam Ghakkar, and was surrendered by
him to Humayun; was blinded by the insistence of the

amirs on August 17, 1553, and allowed to go to Makka.
He was accompanied, as all the writers tell, by his Arghtin
wife Mah-chuchak, and by her equal in compassion, a
servant of Humayun, Chilma Beg. He made the faj four
times and he died on October 5th, 1557. Mah-chuchak sur-
vived him seven months. She only of his wives is com-
memorated as accompanying him to Makka, but I see no
reason why others may not also be accepted as equally
faithful. Her father opposed her going, and she roundly
upheld her view of her duty and has been taken into the
texture of history, but her co-wives may have gone un-
opposed and unpraised. How interesting Kamran might
have made a book of Memoirs in which he set down his
life from his own point of view, his motives, ambitions,
opinions of right and wrong, and above all, if he had spoken
his inner mind about the religious duties he was enabled
to perform before death, through his defeat and mutilation !
We do not know all the truth about him ; certain crimes, of
murder and of treachery after promise given, could never be
palliated, but in the matter of possession of Kabul there
may be much brought forward which would place him
rather in the position of the defender of rights than their
assailant. He had no courtly chronicler, and has borne
the blame of much that could plausibly be traced back to
Humayun’s own defects and their outcome of opportunity. °

To end the story of the faithful brothers ;—‘Askari too
received leave to go to Makka from Badakshan in 1551; he
died between that city and Damascus in 1558. Both he and
Kamran thus lived long enough to see their house triumph
again in India and their weary thwartings of its elder
branch set at naught by the firmer hands of Akbar’s chiefs.
Of ‘Askari one clear characteristic only comes out: he was
true to the blood-tie with his mother’s son and own senior,
Kamran.

A little return must now be made, in order to bring up
the tale of home events to the date of those military. In
1551 the first marriage of the younger generation was
arranged by the betrothal of Bakhshi-banu to Ibrahim, son

of Haram. The Badakhshi trio had certainly deserved
well of Humayun and, while doing the best they could to
strengthen their own position, had given him efficient
help. It is good to tell all that is known of Haram. She
seems to have had several daughters who played a part in
public events as seals of alliance. When Humayun had
passed a short time of repose in Kabul after his victory of
Ushtur-gram, he sent to Haram to ask Shahzada Khanam,
one of these girls, in marriage for himself. His envoys
were two persons whom Haram did not consider worthy of
their office. They were members of the royal household,
and trusted members too, for one was Khwaja Jalalu-d-din
Mahmud, mi samdan,} who, on Akbar’s accession, was
made commander of 2,500; and the other was Bibi Fatima,
whom we know as having helped to nurse Humayun in his
illness of 1546.

Haram, the dominant partner in the command of
Badakhshan, mother of a girl in whose veins was reputed
to flow the blood of Alexander and of Timur, daughter of a
tribal chief, and conscious of intrinsic claim to deference,
inquired of the two lowly messengers why no begam or lady
(aghacha) had come to prefer the royal request. She must
have known that Humayun could not mean to affront
her; he had just given his daughter to her son and had
testified gratitude for help in substantial ways to Sulaiman
at the same time. She allowed herself to be mollified on
condition that he himself should come to fetch his bride.
The wedding does not seem to have taken place and the
alliance was handed on to the next generation, in which,
besides Ibrahim’s, there was a betrothal of Muhammad
Hakim to a daughter of Haram.

While speaking of Haram and the alliances of her
family with the royal house, there may be named a high-
- handed act about another quasi-royal marriage. One of

and a word not linked in English with intoxicants would be better.

Kamran’s wives was Muhtarima Khanam Chaghatdi, and
on his death Sulaiman wished to marry her. Of her as
co-wife, Haram would not hear, and contrived to make her
a daughter-in-law by marrying her to Ibrahim. ——
The death of Hindal in the night attack of Kamran, on ~
November 20th, 1551, was a heavy blow to Gul-badan.
She writes of it with feeling, and casts light on the question
of rank in the affections of a Musalman wife. She asks
why her son or her husband was not killed rather than her
brother. Perhaps she spoke out of feeling born of the fact
that no dead father’s son can be replaced, and from the
deeps of family affection. Dutiful and admirable as were
many of the wives of this time, the tie between the husband
and a wife can never be so close as it is where the husband’s
affection is never a divisible factor in the household. Gul-
badan shows that Musalmani affection centred on those of
the same blood.
The royal ladies must have felt it hard when, after
having mourned Humayun through Kamran for nearly
three months, Hindal was killed. This happened near
Khizr Khwaja’s fief of Jui-shahi, which explains why the -
body was sent there for burial and entrusted to the khwaja.
It was removed later to Kabul and laid at Babar’s feet.
Hindal was thirty-two years old, and left one daughter,
Ruqaiya, who became the first wife of Akbar and survived
him, a childless woman, to the age of eighty-four.
Unfortunately for her readers, our begam’s book ends
abruptly (just after she has mentioned the blinding of
Kamran,) in the only MS. of which we have knowledge, i.e.,
that belonging to the British Museum. The missing pages
are a real loss. The narrative breaks off some three years
before Akbar’s accession, and for the future the best
authority on our topics is silent. There is no occurrence of
her own name in the histories until she goes to India in
the first year of Akbar. Much of supreme importance
happened to the royal family in the interval, and this
makes regret the keener for the defective MS.

determined, in 1554, to try his fortune again in Hindustan.
He left Kabul on November 15th,—a date so near that
of Babar’s start in 1525 that it looks as if both obeyed
the same omen of the heavens,—and with Akbar dropped
comfortably down the river from Jalalabad to Peshawar.
The course of his advance beyond the Indus can be followed
in Mr. Erskine’s pages, and need not be repeated here.
He was proclaimed Emperor in Dihli on July 23rd, 1555.
A little-known episode of the time is the visit to India and
the court of Sidi‘ Ali Reis, a Turkish admiral of Sulaiman
the Great, who by the exigencies of war and weather
found himself obliged to travel with a few officers and fifty
sailors from Strat to Lahor and thence across all the wide
intervening lands to Turkey... He was welcomed by
Musalmans for his master’s sake, and he was offered
appointments in India, all of which he refused. He was
received with great honour by Shah Husain Arghin, of
whom he says that he had then reigned forty years, and
had become so invalided during the last five that he could
not sit his horse and used only boats for travel. Else-
where it is said of Shah Husain that he was subject to
fever of such kind that he could live only on the river, and
that he used to spend his time in going up and down from
_ one extremity to the other of his territory in search of
ease and health. Probably this is a detail of the admiral’s
remark. He heard of Mah-chtchak (wife of Husain),
whom he calls Haji Begam, as prisoner of ‘Isa Tarkhan,
and of her return to Husain. He heard, too, something
which is not supported by other writers, namely, that she
poisoned Husain, and that he died in consequence ten days
after she rejoined him. The improbability of this story is
shown by the fact that later on she conveyed Husain’s
body to Makka for interment, an act which would be
incredible if the accusation of murder were true. Much
that is interesting is told of the journey to the first place

where Sidi ‘Ali’s route brought him into contact with Hu-
mayun’s people, i.e., Lahor. He arrived early in August,
shortly after the Restoration (July 23rd), and there awaited
royal orders, because the governor would not let him go on-
until the Emperor had seen him. When one tries to
picture one’s self without telegrams or newspapers, one
judges that a kindly-disposed amir would endeavour to
forward everyone who could tell a tale for the entertain-
ment of the court. Humayun sent for the admiral, and
had him received, in the first half of October,! outside Dihli
by Bairam Khan-i-khanan, other great amirs, 1,000 men,
and 400 elephants. He dined with the Khan-i-khanan, and
was then introduced to the presence. -

As was natural, the Emperor wished to keep his guest at
court permanently, if possible, and if not this, then long
enough to ‘calculate solar and lunar eclipses, their degree
of latitude and exact date, and to help the court astrologers
to study the sun’s course and the points of the equator.’
What fastened interest on the Ottoman was that he learned
to write verses in Chaghatai Turki so well that Humayun
called him a second ‘Ali Shir Nawai. He had a turn for
chronograms, too, and at his first audience presented one
of the taking of Dihli, and made others subsequently which
were admired. He was a clever man, and his literary
aptitudes suited his royal host and the tone of the entourage.
But he had other acquirements than those which ring well .
the change of words and obtained him his sobriquet of
‘book-man,’ and these others he used to bring about an
agreement between the Emperor and his own former host,

1M. Vambéry makes the Emperor urge, as a reason for keeping the
admiral, that they were ‘now close upon’ the rains. But it was
October, and, moreover, Humayiin pointed out that the rivers were in
flood and roads impassable. Perhaps this is a mistake of the admiral’s,
but still he saw the rivers, to his cost, in going to Dihli. Those who
may read the interesting little book, for which thanks are due to
M. Vambéry, need to accept it in other places also with some caution—
é.g., p. 38, Sultan Mahmiid Bhakkar’ is called Husain Arghiin’s adopted
brother, and, p. 40, his father. He was a kika. Some of the mistakes
may well be due to the difficulty of getting hold of a fact, and this
especially on a journey. But cf. p. 43 n. ’

Sultan Mahmud Bhakkart. An official paper was drawn up,
to which Humayun, literally, set his fist, for he dipped his
clenched hand in saffron and laid it on the deed. Mahmud
‘was much pleased, and both he and his vizier wrote their
thanks to the mediator. This incident, and others too,
gave occasion for other Turki ghazels and higher praise.
Sidi “Ali was constantly in the royal circle, and there were
contests in verse-making and dilettante amusements which
reveal the true and newly-risen Huma once more at ease _
in untranquillized India. The traveller had not much to
coax court favour with in the way of gifts, and this plumed
his poetic flights; when he was wearied by his detention,
he carried two ghazels to the royal seal-bearer and let
them plead for his departure. They were heard, and he
got ‘leave to go,’ with gifts and passport.

His affairs were all in order for his start when there
happened the fatal accident which ended Humayitn’s life.
That Humayun should die violently was in keeping with the
’ violent changes of his career; and that he met his death in
a building of Shir Shah was a singular chance. His last
hours of activity were filled by pleasant occupations; old
friends had been seen who had just come back from Makka
and would bring him news of both pilgrim brothers; letters
had been read from home in Kabul; he had gone up to the
roof of the Shir Mandal, which he used as his library, and
had shown himself to the crowd assembled below; then he
had interested himself in the rising of Venus, with the
object of fixing a propitious hour for a reception,—perhaps
to include the farewell of the Turkish guest.

The Shir Mandal is a two-storied building with flat roof
in the middle of which rises a small cupola which looks like
a shade from the sun. The roof is reached by two discon-
tinuous, steep, and narrow flights of high and shallow granite
steps, which are enclosed in walls and the upper one of which
emerges through the roof. The Emperor on that Friday
evening of January 24th, 1556, had started down the upper
flight and was on its second step, when the mw’azzin raised
the cry for prayer from the neighbouring mosque. Sidi

“Ali says, as though it were some individual habit of
Humayun, that the latter had the custom of kneeling
whenever he heard the cry; other writers say that he
tried to seat himself. His foot became entangled, some
say in his mantle (postin), his staff slid along the smooth
step, and he fell to the bottom of the flight with severe
injuries to head and arm. It is professed that a letter
went after the fall from him to Akbar, but this may be a
part of the well-meaning deception in which the dangerous
nature of the injuries was shrouded; it would seem
more probable from the admiral’s account of the episode,
which is silent as to any recovery of consciousness, that
the injuries to the head were too severe to allow of
restoration to sense. Three days later Humayun died, on
January 27th, and in the forty-eighth year of his age.

‘We come from God, and to Him we return,’ and
‘There is no guard against fate,’ are the quoted comments
of the Turkish admiral. He counselled that the death
should be concealed until Akbar’s return to Dihli, and
brought forward experience drawn from his own country’s
similar circumstances. This was done and various fictions
were composed. A man personated the dead Emperor in
public audience, and there were rejoicings over his recovery
from the fall. Sidi ‘Ali took leave of the grandees, and
conveyed the false news of Humayun’s restoration to
health in a friendly way along his route. By the time he
reached Lahor he found that Akbar had been proclaimed,
and his name read in the Friday prayers. Here, as
before, the traveller had to wait for royal orders, because
the governor had, or invented, useful orders for the crisis,
that no one should pass to Kabul. Then he was sent to
the presence in Kilantr, where Akbar honoured his father’s
passport and let the harassed and home-sick man con-
tinue his journey, with money for expenses and a strong
escort to Kabul.

Before bidding him good-bye on his still lengthy journey,
it may be said that he and his four escorting begs and his
sailors marched to Peshawar through the night to escape that

Adam Ghakkar who had made over Kamran to Humayun ;
that they saw two rhinoceroses, an event which makes one
wonder whether there still remained a part of the ancient
lake of the plain of Peshawar to serve as habitat for the
huge and now vanished beasts; and that they crossed the
many-memoried Khaibar.

In Kabul the admiral saw Humaytn’s two sons,
Muhammad Hakim and Farrukh-fal, who were born in
the same month of 1553, one being the child of Mah-
chuchak and the other of Khanish dgha Khwdarizmi. This
statement is a surprise, because Bayazid says that Farrukh
died within a few days of birth. The admiral’s information
suggests an error in Bayazid’s MS.

Sidi ‘Ali found Kabul beautiful and speaks of its snowy
girdle, its gardens and its running water. He traced pleasure
and merriment and feasting everywhere, and even instituted
comparison between it and Paradise to the disadvantage of
the latter. But he had no time for ‘ frivolities,’ and thought
only of hurrying home. He saw Mu‘nim Khan in the city,
and being told by him that he could not cross the passes,
observed that men had overcome mountains, and under the
- care of a local guide whose home was on the road, accom-
plished the feat with labour and safely. He took the road
to Taliqan and there saw our well-known friends, Sulaiman
and Ibrahim, but he is silent as to Haram. Here, too, he
wrote and offered his ghazel, and was both welcomed and
speeded. In Taliqaén we must leave him who has been a
welcome new figure amongst familiar actors.

Section JII].—Unper Axpar.

Protected by the capable men who upheld Akbar, the
royal ladies had not again to flee before foes or to suffer
violent change of fortune. Humaytn had planed their
journey from Kabul to India. Akbar more than once in
his first year of rule had to cancel the orders he had given
to effect it. Three military affairs disturbed the plan,—the
suppression of the revolt of Abi’l-ma‘ali, the operations

57

against Sikandar Afghan, and the encounter with Himt at
Panipat. At length amirs were named to escort the ladies
from Kabul. The officers set out, but on their march
received orders to act first against Sulaiman Mirza, who,———
on hearing of Humayin’s death, had come over from
Badakhshan to besiege Kabul. This was the first of a
series of his attempts on the city, to which he laid fanciful
claim as head of the house of Timur after Humayun. The
approach of the imperial troops broke up his siege, and his
claim having been accommodated by reading his name
once in the khutba at Kabul, he went home and left the
ladies free to start.

They made their journey in time to arrive during the
first quarter of 1557 near where lay the royal camp, at
Mankot, in the western Sewaliks. The Emperor came a
stage from it to meet them, and was ‘much comforted by
the reunion.’ With Hamida-banu Begam, to whom, as
Empress-mother, the chief place must be assigned, were
Gul-badan, Gul-chihra, Haji, and Salima Begams. There
was also a large company of officers’ wives.

Perhaps the ladies remained near the camp until it broke
up and went to Lahor. It left that city on its march for
Dihli on December 7th, 1557; at Jalindhar it halted, and
here, with pomp and amidst general interest, Bairam
Khan-i-khanan married Salima Sultan Begam, a grand-
daughter of Babar. She was a half-niece of Humayun,
and she had with Akbar cousinship of the ‘four-anna’
degree. Babar was their common ancestor, and their
differing grandmothers diluted the cousinly relation.

This alliance had been arranged by Humayin, and the
use of sipurdan by Abu’l-fazl when writing of it, shows
that what was now celebrated was a marriage, and not a
betrothal. This point is mentioned here because some
writers fix Salima’s age at this time as five, an estimate
which is not supported by known facts of her life. The bride
was probably a reward for the surpassing services done by
Bairam for Humayun, the newest being those of the Resto-
ration. Bairam was a man to whom seems due the largesse

of the hand of a king’s daughter; he out-topped his con-
temporaries by his full stature in capacity, culture, faithful-
ness, and character. Salima,} though much his junior, was
in other respects a fit wife for him. She was an educated
woman; ranks amongst verse-makers so completely as to
have a pen-name (takhallas), and stands out gently, by
birth, character, and attainments.

Khizr Khwaja Khan had gone to Hindustan with
Humayiin in 1554, and early in 1556 had been appointed
by Akbar to the government of Lahor. He was left to
carry on operations against Sikandar Afghan when Akbar
was called away by Himw’s movements, and he was defeated.
The few words said about him give the impression that
he was not a good soldier, and he is never again named
in responsible command. The slight things recorded of
him point to subsequent comfortable existence at court as
the ‘husband of the Emperor’s aunt, Gul-badan Begam.’
Once he made a gift of horses to Akbar; in 1563 he helped
to nurse Akbar when the latter was wounded in Dihli; and
there is no record of his death. He was raised to high
military rank, and at some time was amiru-l-wmara, but
the Ain-i-akbart does not place him in its list of mansabdars.
He stands twelfth in the general list of the T'abaqat, and
amongst the chiefs of 5,000.

From her coming to India in 1557 to the time of her
pilgrimage in 1574, our princess is not mentioned by the
historians. The interval held much of deep interest to her
and to others of her generation whose lives were slipping
away under the safeguarding of Akbar. Some survivors of
an older day, witnesses of Bairam’s fidelity to Humayun,
must have felt his downfall keenly. Hamida can hardly
have been ignorant of the intrigue which brought this
about, because she was related to the chief actors in it,-—
Maham anaga, Adham Khan, and Shihabu-d-din Ahmad

1 The histories have a definite statement about her descent which
yet presents difficulties when looked into. Its points are considered in
the Appendix, s.n. Salima.

Nishaptirt. The last was governor of Dihli, where she
lived, and part of the scheme to separate Akbar from
Bairam took him to Dihli to see her, and thus under the
eye of Shihab. Hamida must have had clear in memory ———~
the truly valid services done for her husband by Bairam
during the Persian exile. The plot had its nucleus in a
sayyid circle and in families religious by inheritance, and it
was carried out at the point of the tongue. Muhammad
Baqi Khan kitka, the anaga's elder son, does not appear as
taking part in it. He served the Emperor till 1584, rose
to be a chief of 8,000, and of his character nothing is
known. His younger brother, Adham, although put to
death in 1562, had become chief of 5,000. All that is said
of him is bad, and he, like his mother, was fluent in detrac-
tion and did all in his power to poison the mind of Akbar
against the worthiest of his amirs.

Many comments have been made upon Maham anaga,
both by the Persian writers and by their Kuropean com-
mentators. Abi’l-fazl calls her a cupola of chastity, and
it is now possible to wipe from her reputation the stain —
suggested by Professor Blochmann when writing of the
parentage of Adham. She was wife of Nadim Khan hika,
a faithful servant of Humayin. This fragment of useful
information was brought to light by Mr. Beveridge, who
found it in a MS. of Colonel Hanna, which may yield other
valuable matter on quasi-domestic points. Maham anaga
may be granted the praise she deserves as a nurse who
earned the affection of Akbar to the end of her life; she is
entitled to such praise as belongs to a mother who screens
a son’s every fault and pushes his fortunes with all her
influence. She must take the dispraise of not pushing her
elder son’s as she did Adham’s. Bayazid biyat speaks of .
her as kind to him, and tells little stories which show her
the centre of small affairs. I have not discerned in her any
sign of talent. Whatever influence Akbar’s affection gave
her would be strengthened by her connection with his
mother, and perhaps, too, with other women who were de-
scended from Ahmad Jami. Amongst these was Haji

Begam, Humayiin’s widow and a person much regarded
by the Emperor.

In the year following Bairam’s death, Adham Khan,
who, says the Tabaqat, held a place higher than the other
courtiers because he was his mother’s son, was on duty in
Malwa against Baz Bahadur Sur. Incidents resulted
which emphasize regret that for such as the actors in them
Bairam had had to make way. Maham anaga was de facto
prime minister; Mu'nim Khan had been made Khan-i-
khandn, and it was looked for by his friend the anaga that he
should become prime minister de jure. Baz Bahadur was
defeated and fled from Sarangpir. Aping the Hindis, he
had ordered his servants to kill the women of his household
in the event of his defeat. Several had been so killed,
many had been wounded, when the sacrifice was inter-
rupted by the imperialists under Adham. Badayuni says
that there followed slaughter by Adham and his colleague,
Pir Muhammad Khan, of terrible extent, and his own eyes
saw that these two regarded God’s creation in mankind as
leeks, cucumbers, and radishes,—a quaint turn of words
which covers awful butchery. When remonstrated with
in the name of the law, the murderers asked what was to
be done with so many prisoners.

If the order for the death of the women of Baz Bahadur’s
household had issued from a Rajpit heart, there would
have been no need for executioners while he was in flight.
The victims were, however, not Rajputnis, and they suffered
only to gratify the vanity of a Moslim. Amongst those
wounded was Rup-mati, a dancing-girl renowned through-
out Hindustan for beauty, singing, and poetic gifts. Her
name seems that of a Hindi. Her wounds, inflicted by
Baz Bahadur’s order, were severe and she wished to die.
Adham let her know that, if she would care for herself, he
would send her to her master when she could travel. She
took his promise as true, had her wounds dressed and re-
covered. When she claimed fulfilment of Adham’s word,
. she was told to consider herself as his slave. He entered
her room, raised her veil, and saw her dead by her own act.


--- Page 78 ---

61

Perhaps the point of deepest social degradation in this
story is that Rip-mati was, by men’s decree, born to sin
without blame, and yet she died because she loved one
man. Her heart was single, and yet she was only the———_
most charming, clever and beautiful of a crowd of dancing-
girls, purchased slaves, to whom no man’s loyalty and no
mercy were thought due.

Adham Khan took much booty from Baz Bahadur, and
he disregarded the rule which required the choicest part
to be sent to the Emperor; he also comported himself more
like an independent ruler than a king’s lieutenant. This
angered Akbar, and he hurried off to Sarangpir, out-
distanced a messenger of Maham anaga whom she had sent
with warnings, and took Adham by surprise. She herself
came in next day and counselled surrender of the spoil.
This and other matters having been adjusted, the Emperor
started for his capital. No sooner was he gone than Adham,
with his mother’s connivance, regained possession of two of
the most coveted of the captive women. News of this went
after Akbar, who ordered them to be returned to the royal
camp. When they came again within her power, the
anaga had them murdered, so that they might not tell
the tale of their abduction.

Having spent so many years under the influence of
Maham anaga, it is to the credit of Akbar’s humanity and
mental force that there are not more than the recorded
blots on his scutcheon ; at nineteen he rebelled against his
nurse, when she had set his feet on the primrose path to
ruin of person and empire. He did not punish the murder
of the captive girls, but he soon manifested his intention to
depose his nurse and her son from power. Instead of
appointing their friend Mu'nim prime minister, he sum-
moned his foster-father, Shamsu-d-din Ahmad Ghaznavt
and gave him the post. Shamsu-d-din was an unlettered
man, but he was staunch and had sons who were true to
Ji-Ji anaga’s nursling.

The next episode in which Maham anaga and her son
appear, was one to shake the home fabric to its foundations,


--- Page 79 ---

62

for Adham murdered Shamsu-d-din, bursting in upon him
as he sat in business audience and unsuspicious. It was
done on the night of May 16th, 1562. The incident is well
known, how the murderer rushed to the faram door and
on the appearance of Akbar began to palliate his crime,
but was struck down by a blow of the royal fist and then
killed by royal order.!

It was the Emperor who told Maham anaga of her son’s
death: ‘Mama! we have killed Adham,’ are the words put
into his mouth by Bayazid. She fell ill from anger and
grief; this blow shattered her heart’s idol and her ambi-
tion for him and herself. Badayuni says that she died
after having presented the food of the fortieth day of
mourning, and this points to her belief that the souls of
the dead take final departure from earth on that day and
_ after partaking of the food of their choice which the care
of relations sets for them. Mother and son were buried
in one spot, and Akbar placed his shoulder under his
nurse’s bier in sign of his sentiment to her.

Quite stirring news for discussion through some years,
amongst the elder ladies of the royal family, would be the
conduct of Mah-chichak Begam in Kabul. She was the
last recorded wife of Humayin,.and was married in 1546,
after the coming of Hamida from Qandahar to Kabul. She
was not a woman of birth,—one gathers a general impres-
sion that few royal wives married late in life were so,—and
her title of begam was probably owed to her having borne a
son, Muhammad Hakim. In 1554 Humayun had left her
three-years-old boy as nominal governor of Kabul under
charge of Mu‘nim Khan, and in 1556 Akbar had confirmed
the appointment. When Munim went to court in 1561,

1 Some writers put into Akbar’s mouth, when he addressed Adham,
an epithet which would imply baseness in his birth and opprobrium of
his mother; but I am advised that from various considerations weight
need not be given to the inference of the word, which, moreover, is not
used by all the sources. The point is mentioned here because of the
contradiction involved in the epithet with the statement of marriage
with Nadim kika, and with the terms of respect employed towards
the anaga by the Persian writer who uses the degrading epithet.

63

his son Ghani became his locum tenens, but Ghani had
neither ‘suavity nor sense,’ and the begam shut him
out of Kabul, one morning when he had gone to walk
in the melon gardens. He went to India, and she took
up the guidance of her boy’s affairs. She chose three men
to help her; two soon came by their deaths at her dicta-
tion, and the third became supreme. Akbar, and no doubt
the ladies also, heard of these doings, and despatched
Mu‘'nim Khan with men to put things straight. Mah-
chichak met Munim at Jalalabad, utterly defeated him,
and he fled to court. She then killed the last adviser
of her trio and took another, whom she may have married,
named Haidar Qasim Kohbur. These proceedings surprise
one in Mah-chtchak, and bring her story down to the
first half of 1564, when Abu’l-ma‘ali appears upon her
stage.

We cannot enter here into the previous history of Abu’l-
ma ali,—his rebellions, murders, imprisonment, pilgrimage,
and reinvigorated return to wickedness. He now came
to Kabul fresh from two assassinations in Hindustan, a
fugitive, and indited a letter to the ruling begam, with
profession of affection and devotion to the memory of
Humaytn. She welcomed him, gave him her little
daughter Fakhru-n-nisa in marriage, and let him take
the lead. Before long he stabbed Mah-chuchak with his
own hand, murdered Haidar Qasim, and stirred revolt
against himself which led to woeful slaughter within the
walls of Kabul. Word of all this went from Muhammad
Hakim to Sulaiman and Haram, with a prayer for help.
Haram approving and accompanying, the army of Badakh-
shan marched over the passes, met Abu’l-ma ali in the
Ghurband valley, captured him, and sent him bound to
the prince, who had him strangled. Both he and Adham
Khan had justified Bairam’s distrust, which had prompted
him to wish their death early in Akbar’s reign.

A little story of Haram may be inserted here, somewhat
after date. She had not been always on perfect terms
with Sulaiman. Not only, a little earlier, had there been

_—_—

64

the discussion between them of his wish to take Muhtarima
to wife, which Haram had frustrated by marrying the
khanam to Sulaiman’s son instead of to himself, but she
had been angered extremely by the murder of one of her
brothers by her husband and her son. She took the reso-
lution of deserting Sulaiman and went over to Kabul, where
then Mu'nim Khan was governor, and she had meant to
carry on her complaints to Akbar. Mu'nim, however, who
had been begged to mediate by Sulaiman, gave her good
advice and pacified her, so that at last she consented to
return to Badakhshan. He rode out to bid her farewell ;
she bade her camel kneel and dismounted; he got off his
horse, and there was exchange of friendly greeting. She
told him she regarded him as a brother and that for his
sake she would never bring the army of Badakhshan against
Kabul. It came several times later and with her approval,
but Haram could swear and break even ‘awful oaths.’
Bayazid biyat accompanied her to the Ghurband and was
charmed by her suavity and agreeableness.

On the death of Abiu‘l-ma‘ali, Sulaiman sent home for a
daughter and married her to Muhammad Hakim, parti-
tioned out some of the lands of Kabul to his own people,
and went home to Qila‘-i-zafar. Irritation against the
interlopers led to their expulsion by the Kabulis, and
this brought the Badakhshi forces again to Kabul, in 1564.
Muhammad Hakim hurried to the Indus and complained
to his big brother and Sulaiman was made to retreat.

In 1566 he and Haram and their girls were again
before the coveted Kabul, and on this occasion Haram
tried to supplement their failing military action by .
treachery. She got Sulaiman to lay an ambush for Mu-
hammad Hakim, whom, with ‘awful oaths’ of amity, she
had persuaded to have a meeting with her under profession
of desire to adopt him now that her son Ibrahim was dead.
The end of this affair was, in net result to the Badakh-
shis, nothing; Haram went home and Sulaiman followed.
With them went the unfailing daughters, of whom Haram
seems to have had many, or who were betrothed and not

65

‘entrusted,’ so many recorded times. They had been near
capture by the Kabulis in the Four-walled Garden, but the
commandant of the city recalled his men and let the girls
go free, because he did not think it seemly to capture
women.

This is not the place to follow Sulaiman’s interesting
fortunes to their close, under Akbar’s protection, by death
in Lahor in 1589. For our purpose, it is enough to say
that he held Badakhshan so long as Haram’s watchful eye
was on him, and lost it at her death. It was Muhtarima’s
son, Shah-rukh, his own grandson, who turned him out of
his beloved Badakhshan, and in this, too, there may be
Haram’s hand. Muhtarima would not be likely to teach
her boy dutiful conduct to Haram or to Haram’s husband,
for the two women were foes, and Haram had tried to
separate Muhtarima from her son, and to expel her from
Badakhshan to her parental home in Kashghar. If Haram
had lived, her pride would have found content in two
alliances of her grandson with daughters of the royal blood,
—one a child of Muhammad Hakim, and the other of
Akbar himself.

The ill-behaviour of Hamida-banu’s brother, Khwaja
Mu'‘azzam, must have been a frequent annoyance to the
inner circle of the elder ladies at court. From boyhood
he had been fantastic and mischievous, and perhaps carried
always the germ of the madness which overtook his last
years. Bairim, the sensible, had exiled him, then had
given him some countenance; on Bairam’s fall he had
received a fief, and, so far, had been favoured. But Akbar
did not like him, and the murders he had committed were
sufficient to warrant dislike. He was a true parvenu,
assertive and relying on his sister to excuse his faults.
Hamida had been conscious before her marriage that her
lowly birth was a point against her wedding with Humayun.
The disparity in her case, as in other misalliances of
the time, had raised unworthy people to power. Now,
in 1564, Bibi Fatima lamented to Akbar that Khwaja
Mu‘azzam had threatened to kill his wife Zuhra, who was

5

66

her daughter. The Emperor consequently sent the khwaja
word that he was coming to his house, and followed the
message closely. As he entered, the khwaja stabbed
Zuhra and then flung his knife, like a challenge, amongst
the royal followers. Abw’l-fazl says that for punishment
the murderer was flung into the river, but ‘would not
drown.’ The more sensible Nizému-d-din Ahmad says he
was beaten and then soused in the river. He died insane,
in prison, at Gualiar. All the shortcomings and crimes of
the man notwithstanding, Hamida must have cherished
some warmth of feeling for the tricksy boy who had lifted
suspicion from her in the matter of the stolen rubies of the
Persian episode.

In 1571 another old acquaintance comes to the front in
the person of Nahid Begam, in whom our princess must
have maintained interest for the sake of her father Qasim,
Babar’s foster-brother. Nahid, as has been said earlier, was
the daughter of Qasim and of Mah-chuchak Arghiin, who
must not be confounded with Kamran’s wife of the same
name, one common amongst the Arghin women of the
time. She had married Muhibb-‘ali, son of Nizamu-d-din
‘Ali Khalifa Barlas, and who had risen to high military
rank but now lived remote from soldiering and in reposeful
retirement. Nahid’s mother was now in her (third) widow-
hood for ‘Isa Tarkhan Arghin, and she was not well
regarded by her last husband’s son, Muhammad Baqi
Tarkhan Arghin, the ruler of Tatta. Nahid, in 1571, went
to see her mother, and perhaps conveyed to Baqi the
impression that her visit was something more than filial.
He put Mah-chuchak in prison, and so behaved to Nahid
that she hurried off to court and made bitter complaint of
her own wrongs and of the rudeness shown to the royal
attendants who had been with her in Sind. She told Akbar,
too, that she had talked with Sultan Mahmud Bhakkari,
that old retainer of Shah Husain who had kept the island-
fort against Humayitn in the forties, and for whom Sidi
‘Ali Reis had negotiated terms in 1555. Mahmid had
suggested an attack on Tatta, and, supported by him,

Nahid pleaded for help from Akbar to act against Baqi.
She was very keen about her plan and persuaded the
Emperor to give men and money.

Muhibb-‘ali was disturbed from his repose, and put art ——
the head of the force. With him went Nahid and also a
wife named Samia and her son, Mujahid. For Nahid’s
ends the long war that followed was infructuous. An
amusing episode of it was that Samia, when things did not
go as she wished, went into rebellion against Akbar, and
actually held an entrenchment against the royal amirs a
day and a night. In the end, Muhibb-ali obtained a
comfortable town appointment and nothing more is heard
of the ladies. Probably they too accommodated them-
selves to the tolerant and forgiving atmosphere of Akbar’s
court.

Nizamu-d-din Ahmad is somewhat more sober of diction
than his fellow-penmen and so, when he says that the
Gujrat campaign of 1572 caused the royal ladies joy
enough to last their lives, whole-hearted delight is pictured.
‘This was the campaign which made beautiful Sikri the City
of Victory (Fath-par). Round one incident of the war
womanly interest,—and surely compassion also,—will have
centred. The veil of historic silence lifts for a brief moment,
and shows Gul-rukh, Kamran’s daughter, in flight with
her son.

Gul-badan’s long span of unchronicled life was probably
spent in the peaceful occupation of a wife and mother, with
variety from books, verse-making, festivities, and outside
news. She must have found much to exercise her lively
mind in Hindustan. That she went about with the royal
camp is shown by the record of the place assigned to her
tent in the encampments. It was pitched next to Hamida’s,
well within the great enclosure, and not far from the
Emperor’s own. Since she was a woman, she must have
found food for observation in the doings and position of her
sex under the conditions of their life in Hindustan. How
did sat? look to her? What did she think of the juhar ?
Both these Hindu customs were far different from those of

5—2

her traditions in similar crises. She came of a tribe which
boasts of the fidelity of its wives to the marriage tie. All
the women of her house must have heard of the defiant act
of Ais-daulat, Babar’s grandmother, who had ordered her
maids to stab a man to whom her captor had given her, and
who then, for sole excuse, had observed that she was the
wife of Yanas Khan. Gul-badan had also in her own family
history plenty of examples of the fate of captured girls, for
many of her kinswomen had married foes of their tribe ;
and many too had become contented wives, well treated,
and remaining in their foreign homes apparently without
constraint.!

What Timurid women saw amongst the Hindus reveals
another type of virtue and another standard of wedded life.
Our princess must have heard something on the topic
through her father’s experience when she was a child.
Wifehood and motherhood now gave her better insight into
the problems which underlie social relations. She would
hear that Rajpttnis died joyfully rather than be captured ;
that outmatched Rajputs killed wives and children and
went to certain death themselves,—a holocaust to honour.
The early years of Akbar furnished plenty of such records.

How, one would like to know, did the Musalmani regard
the willing death by fire of the Hindt widow, in that exalta-
tion which lifts thought above pain and terror and is
admirable, whether in the martyr for faith or for wifely
duty? Unfortunately, the barriers of language and habit
must have kept Akbar’s Rajput wives from charming the
Musalmani ladies by recital of the legends of their race.
These Hindus can never have been welcome inmates of the

1 TJ think, and the impression is gathered from the Memoirs, that
although women and children were often murdered by victorious
soldiers, wives were often returned to their husbands or families, and
that enforced marriage was usually with the defeated leader’s
daughters. Perhaps the Muhammadan law of divorce helped the
wives. Injustice might easily be done under the rough-and-ready
expectation that family ties would be set at naught by conquerors
who were Muhammadans. There was certainly diversity of action
and of degree of mercy and chivalry.

palace to any of the Moslims; but, pagan as they were
thought, their conduct as wives must have insinuated the _
thin edge of conviction that to no one form of faith is
committed the nurture of the sense of duty.

One common thought Gul-badan and the rest could have
shared with the Hindt ladies,—that of the duty of pilgrim-
age and of respect for holy places. When next history
concerns itself with our begam, it is to tell of her setting
out, in 1575, for Makka. The Emperor had been unwilling
to part with her, and it may be, even, had delayed with
the thought of accompanying her. His heart was now
much set upon making the Aaj, but he did no more than
walk a short distance with a caravan from Agra, dressed in
the seamless wrapper of the Arabian ceremonies. Though
debarred from leaving Hindistan himself, he helped many
others to fulfil this primary duty of their faith, and opened
wide his purse for their expenses. Hach year he named a
leader of the caravan, and provided him with gifts and
‘ample funds. Sultan Khwaja, Gul-badan’s cicerone, took,
amongst other presents, 12,000 dresses of honour. He did
not bring her home again; this duty fell to Khwaja Yahya
(John). What circumstance extorted royal consent to Gul-
badan’s absence is not recorded; her advancing age,—she
was past fifty,—and her dislike of the laxity in opinion and
practice in matters of the Faith would add warmth to her
request for leave to go.

Abi’l-fazl has preserved the names of the chief ladies of
the pilgrim party, but many others went with Gul-badan
Begam, and for all the royal purse bore the cost. She
was the lady of highest birth, and was probably a widow;
next came Salima Sultan Begam, widow of Bairam and
wife of Akbar. It was not usual for a wife to make the
pilgrimage, but Muhammadan law stipulates that per-
mission shall be granted to such wives as strongly desire
to do so, and Salima’s seems a case in point. Next comes
@ woman whose presence reveals pleasant things. She was
Sultanam, widow of Akbar’s uncle, ‘Askari, and of her it is
recorded in Akbar’s babyhood that she cared for him when

captured, with tender affection. It is probable that she
had spent many years under the care and at the cost of
the Emperor. Then come two step-nieces of Gul-badan,
daughters of Kamran,—Haji and Gul-izar Begams. I do
not know which child of his is veiled under the title of
Haji. She seems to be making her second haj, and may
well have gone on her first when her father was in Arabia.
To these two the pilgrimage would have humanly pious
significance, as a visitation to their father’s tomb and to
that of Mah-chtchak Arghiin, whom all his children must
have held in reverence. Next comes a grand-daughter of
Gul-badan herself, named Um-kilsum (Mother of Plump-
ness), presumably after the daughter of her Prophet.
Whether she was the child of Sa‘adat-yar is not said, nor
whether the last name on the list, Salima Khanam, is that
of a child of Gul-badan, as well as of Khizr Khwaja Khan.
Here some of the inconveniences of polygamy show them-
selves to the seeker after family facts.

An old associate of our princess accompanied her in the
person of Gul-nar dghdcha, who had been of Babar’s house-
hold and was, I think, one of the two Circassians sent as a
present to him by Shah Tahmasp in 1526. She was now
well on her way through life and considerably older than
Gul-badan Begam. Another of the party had also been of
Babar’s household, Bibi Sart-qad, or Sari-i-sahi (Straight
Cypress). She had been, too, in Humayiin’s service and
later had married, with full nisbat, Munim Khdn-i-khanan.
She was a widow, had been a singer and reciter, and was
a ‘reliable woman.’ Like her in accomplishments were Bibi
Safiya and Shaham dghd, both formerly of Humayin’s
household. Of the first and of Bibi Sari-qad we have the
happy little record that they sang in the moonlight on the
road to Laghman in 1549.

Fathpir-sikri seems to have been the rallying-point of -
the caravan and October 15th, 1575, the day of departure
from it. It started earlier than was usual, perhaps because
the ladies could not travel fast. Caravans generally left
Agra in the tenth month—this left in the seventh—of the


--- Page 88 ---

7

Muhammadan year. Akbar’s second boy, Murad, was told

off to escort the ladies to the coast. Salim met them one

stage out to give last greetings. At Gul-badan’s request,
Murad was excused from his long task of escort to Sarat,—
and he went back to Agra. One smiles to find that the
princes were five and four years old. The real charge of

the caravan was with several amirs, one being Muhammad

Baqi Khan kika, and another Rumi Khan of Aleppo, who

may have been Babar’s artillery officer.

It is a real loss that there is no record of the journey
from our begam’s pen. It was to be adventurous; even
perilous; and it was of great interest whether as sight-
seeing travel or pious duty. Surat was the port of embarka-
tion, but there are no details of the road taken to reach it.
Father Rudolf Acquaviva passed between the same two
terminal points in 1580, but the military movements of the
interval may well have allowed him to travel where the
ladies could not go. When they were first in Surat, it had
been a royal possession for two years only, and even when
the Father took the fairly direct route from it to Fathpuir-
sikri, the Rajput peasantry was in arms against their new
lord. The ladies were probably handed on from one
garrisoned place to another as the immediate circumstances
of conquest dictated. The main body of their haj joined
them by a tedious and weary route, first escorted through
Goganda by the army which was on active service, and
then passing on to Ahmadabad, and, perhaps by water, to
Surat. °

The governor of the port, who was to have a good deal
of trouble with this caravan, was Qulij Khan Andijani, a
sobriquet of pleasant sound in our begam’s ears. He had
inherited Timurid service from many generations, and his
father had been a grandee of Sultan Husain Bayqra.

‘There was peace with the isles of the Franks,’ but it
took the ladies a year to get to sea. The Akbar-nama
attributes some part of the delay to a foolish panic about
the Firingis which, after the ladies had embarked in their
hired Turkish transport, the Salimit, seized the other


--- Page 89 ---

72

pilgrims who were to sail in the royal ship, the Ilahi.
The real ground appears to have been want of a pass.
The Portuguese were then masters of the Indian waters,
and no ship might dare to put to sea without toll paid and
pass obtained. Alarm about the Portuguese was natural,
for there were stories that the very pass was sometimes a
letter of Bellerophon enjoining capture and death. Abu’l-
fazl says that, although the ladies embarked, they were
unwilling to put out and desert their fellow-pilgrims.
This may be mere broidery, or the one ship may have had
a pass and the other not. Perhaps, too, as theirs was a
hired transport, it was also one privileged to sail free.
However this may be, Badayuni makes the difficulty clear
by saying that Khwaja Sultan’s ships lay idle from want
of the pass. He also, it may be added, quotes a legal
opinion that at this time it was not lawful to make the
haj from India because, of the two practicable routes, one
lay through the Shiah country of ‘Iraq, and the other
obliged a pass which bore the idolatrous stamp of the
heads of the Virgin Mary and of Jesus Christ (‘on whom
be peace ’).

The mir haj sent word to the Emperor of his plight, who
at once despatched orders to Qulij Khan, in Idar, to go to
Surat and arrange the difficulty. Qulij took with him a
Cambayan, who was presumably a man versed in seafaring
business,—hurried to Surat and overcame the difficulty.

It took the ladies a year to get to sea; they sailed on
October 17th, 1576. Their port of debarkation is not men-
tioned; some pilgrims sailed by the Arabian, some by the
Persian Gulf. They spent three anda half years in Arabia,
and were able to make the aj four times.

Some day perhaps a pious and enlightened Musalman
will set down the inner meaning he attaches to the rites of
_ the pilgrimage. How interesting it would have been if our
princess had told us what it was in her heart that carried
her through the laborious duties of piety she accomplished
during her long stay in her holy land! She might have
given us an essential principle by which to interpret the


--- Page 90 ---

73

religious meaning which devout women attach to the rites
commanded on the pilgrimage.

The visitation duties are set down in Hughes’ ‘ Dic-
tionary of Islam,’ where even their brief recital is attractive
and adds to the wish of gauging the sentiment of believers
in their efficacy. The acts prescribed are exhausting, not
only to the body but also,.one thinks, to the mind, because
the very conception of the pilgrimage as a Divine ordinance
keeps brain and heart tense, as all obedience does which sets
the human will parallel to the Divine.

The mere recapitulation of the prescribed ceremonies is
impressive: The halt six miles from the city to put on the
seamless wrapper (ikram); the chanting of the pilgrim
song; the prayer of intention and of supplication for grace
to make the visitation duly ; the contemplation, touch, and
salutation of the mystic black stone; the sevenfold en-
compassment of the ka'ba, towards which from distant
homes has been directed the prayer of the bygone years;
the ascent of the Mount of Purity (Safa), and prayer
and confession of faith upon it; the race seven times
repeated from its summit to that of the Mount of Marwa;
the common worship in the Great Mosque, and the sermon
preached to the assemblage of common believers; the
various pilgrimages and prayers of the eighth and ninth |
days; and on the tenth the extraordinary pelting of devils,
which is symbolized by the patriarchal rite of the stoning
of the pillars of Mina. Later in the same day occurs the
final act of the faj, an animal sacrifice. Whether the
ladies could pay a substitute to perform this is not said.

During these ten busy days the seamless wrapper is
worn ; after the sacrifice it is laid aside, and attention may
be paid to the neglected toilette. The pilgrim stays three
days longer in Makka—days of the ‘ drying of the blood of
sacrifice,’ ‘three well-earned days of rest after the peri-
patetic performance of the last four.’ Still, all is not
finished; there should be more circuits of the ka‘ba,
another stoning at Mina, and a draught drunk from the
sacred well. Our princess would certainly do everything

74

which was due, and probably would go to Medina, and
she would also make visitation to the tombs of many pious
persons buried in the desirable soil of Arabia.

In 1579 Khwaja Yahya was mir haj, a friend of Badayuni,
and the charitable man to whom Husain the Patcher
(tukriya) was indebted for decent burial. He was com-
missioned to escort the ladies home, and also to bring back
curiosities and Arab servants,' who may perhaps have been
wanted for the Arab sarai, established near the mausoleum
of Humayun, outside Dihl.

The return journey was both adventurous and perilous.
They were shipwrecked off Aden, and had to stay, some
say seven, others twelve, months in that desolate spot, far
less habitable then than now, with condensed water, a
tide from the Suez Canal, occasional rain, and the British
raj. The governor did not behave well, and quitted the
path of good manners, misconduct for which he was
punished by his master, Sultén Murad of Turkey. One
pleasant incident broke the gloom of the long delay. Ona
day of April, 1580, the rock-bound travellers saw a ship
coming up from the south with the wind, and, wishing to
know whose it was, sent a boat out to make inquiry. By a
pleasant chance Bayazid? biyat with his wife and children
were on board, and he shortened sail, though the wind was
favourable, and gave and took news. Bayazid says that
the persons who sent out the boat to him were Gul-badan
Begam, Gul-izar Begam, and Khwaja Yahya. Perhaps

1 The passage in the Akbar-ndma about these servants is in its
author’s later and difficult style. ‘This led to mistake in my article of
the Calcutta Review, April, 1898. I referred a difficulty the khwaja
experienced to the ladies, whereas it was the servants who were
unwilling to leave their Arabian domicile. Several other errors of that
article are corrected in this book.

2 His wife and a child died in Arabia; he wished to end his days on
the sacred soil, and so sent home his other children. His wish also
was to be laid beside his wife, and he tried her grave for several hours
to see that it was neither too narrow nor too short. Happily for his
readers, he did not stay in Arabia. His children were captured by the
Portuguese, and he had to go back to their rescue. He sailed in 1582,
but had long to wait in Mocha harbour for a wind, and this, with other
delays, kept him eight months on board.

he was instrumental in getting them ships for return to
India.

I do not know when the ladies succeeded in leaving
Aden, nor when they landed in Surat. Here they again
waited long, and this delay is attributed partly to the rains
and partly to the royal absence in Kabul. It was March,
1582, when they reached Fathptr-sikri.

On the northward journey they visited the shrines of the
Chishti sairts in Ajmir, and there met Prince Salim. Day
after day there came an amir with greetings from the
Emperor, until he met the caravan at Khanwa. The night
of reunion was kept awake by ‘questions and entrancing
stories; gifts were shown, and happiness brimmed over.’
One item of home news would cloud the meeting: Bega
Begam had died just too soon to welcome her old friends.

Arrived in Fathpar-sikri, Gul-badan Begam would find
much to ruffle her orthodoxy; for Father Rodolf Acquaviva
was installed there and was giving Prince Murad lessons in
the Christian faith. She would hear of the reverence shown
by her nephew for the sacred things of an alien faith, and
of his liking for the society of the pious and learned guest.
Hamida-bani is named by the Father as protesting, with
other ladies of the haram, against the royal countenance of
Christianity, and assuredly Gul-badan would swell the
chorus of complaint, in which, too, Hindu wives would join
the Moslim lamentation.1. When the Father was leaving
Fathpir-sikri, he accepted only so much money as would
pay his expenses back to Goa, but he asked a favour from
Hamida-bani Begam. She had amongst her household
slaves a Russian of Moscow and his Polish wife, with their
two children. These four the Father begged to take with
him to Goa. ‘The begam, who was no friend to the
Firingis, was most unwilling to give up the slaves; but

1 The whole account of Father Acquaviva’s stay at the court is
extremely interesting, and much of it may be read in Father Goldie’s
‘First Christian Mission to the Great Mughal’ (Dublin: Gill and Co.,
1897).

the Emperor would refuse nothing to the Father,’ and the
family was carried off to freedom.

The next thing known of our princess is that she wrote her
Humadyiin-nama. The book is its sole witness, for no one
speaks of it. It is not literature, but a simple setting down
of what she knew or had heard, for the help of the Akbar-
nama. This was not her only composition, for she followed
the fashion of her day and wrote verses. Mir Mahdi Shirazi
has preserved in his Tazkiratu-l-khwatin two lines of hers,
in which her thought seems to be, ‘No love, no fruit of
life.’

“ Har part ki au b& ‘ashaq khud yar nist,
Tu yaqin midan ki hech az ‘umr bar-khur-dar nist.”

Nine copies were made of Bayazid’s Humdyin-nama,
which was written in obedience to the royal command
obeyed by Gul-badan Begam and also by Jauhar the Ewer-
bearer. Of these two went to the Emperor’s library ; three
to the princes Salim, Murad, and Danyal; one to our begam ;
two to Abw’l-fazl; and one perhaps was kept by the author.
This allotment brings out the little point that Gul-badan
collected books. Badayuni has a curious passage about
himself which also discloses something ‘bookish’ of
Salima: ‘On account of the book Khirad-afza, which had
disappeared from the library, and concerning Salima
Sultan Begam’s study of which the Emperor reminded
me, an order was issued that my allowance should be
stopped, and that they should demand the book of me.’
He adds that Abuw’l-fazl did not lay his refutation before
the Emperor, and he does not clear up the awkward doubt
as to what he had done with Salima’s desired book.

The remaining records of Gul-badan Begam’s life are few
and scanty. When she was seventy, her name is mentioned
with that of Muhammad-yar, a son of her daughter, who
left the court in disgrace; again, she and Salima join in in-
tercession to Akbar for Prince Salim; again, with Hamida,
’ ghe receives royal gifts of money and jewels. Her charities
were large, and it is said of her that she added day unto day


--- Page 94 ---
Courtesy www.pdfbooksfree.pk

in the endeavour to please God, and this by succouring the
poor and needy. When she was eighty years old, and in
February, 1603, her departure was heralded by a few days
of fever. Hamida was with her to the end, and it may be—
that Ruqaiya, Hindal’s daughter, would also watch her last
hours. As she lay with closed eyes, Hamida-banu spoke to
her by the long-used name of affection, ‘ Jiu.” (elder sister).
There was no response. Then, ‘Gul-badan!’ The dying
woman unclosed her eyes, quoted the verse, ‘I die,—may
you live!’ and passed away.

Akbar helped to carry her bier some distance, and for
her soul's repose made lavish gifts and did good works.
He will have joined in the silent prayer for her soul before
committal of her body to the earth, and if no son were
there, he, as a near kinsman, may have answered the
Imam’s injunction to resignation: ‘It is the will of God.’

So ends the long life of a good and clever woman, affec-
tionate and dutiful in her home life, and brought so near
us by her sincerity of speech and by her truth of feeling
that she becomes a friend even across the bars of time and
creed and death.

PART II.
GUL-BADAN BEGAMS BOOK, THE ‘HUMAYUN-NAMA.’

Ir is not generally known to English students of the
(so-called) Mughal period of Indian history that Gul-badan
Begam wrote a book. It was not known to Mr. Erskine,
or he would have given fuller and more accurate accounts
of the families of Babar and Humayiin. It escaped even
Professor Blochmann’s wider opportunities of acquaintance
with Persian MSS. Until the begam’s Humayiin-nama was
catalogued by Dr. Rieu, it was a literary parda-nishin, and -
since that time has been little better. Abu-‘l-fazl, for

whose information it was written, does not mention it, but
the Akbar-ndma is not without indication of its use.?

Bayazid’s Tarikh-i-humayan was reproduced several
times on its completion. Gul-badan Begam’s Humayiin-
nama was written under the same royal order and for the
same end. It would have been natural to reproduce it also,
but no second example of it can be discovered by us in any
of the accessible book-catalogues of Europe or India, and
prolonged search, made by advertisement, private inquiry,
and in person by my husband in India, has failed to dis-
close knowledge of its existence which may not con-
jecturally be traced to my own work upon it. Once hope
arose that a second MS. was to reward the search, because
a correspondent intimated that he possessed for sale a
MS. which was inscribed as being the begam’s. On
examination this was found to be so, but the MS. was a
copy of the Kaniin-i-humayin of Khwand-amir. It is now
in the British Museum.

Hope was again aroused by a mention of Gul-badan’s book
in a recent work, the Darbdar-i-akbart of Shamsu-l-ulama
‘Muhammad Husain dzdd. Mr. Beveridge paid two visits to
the author in Bombay, but could learn nothing from him.
He appeared mentally alienated, denied all knowledge of
the work, and that he had ever written of it. His reference
may conjecturally be traced to my article in the Calcutta
Review upon Gul-badan Begam’s writings, and does not,
unfortunately, appear to indicate access to a second MS.

The MS. from which I have translated belongs to the
Hamilton Collection in the British Museum, and was
bought in 1868 from the widow of Colonel George William
Hamilton. It is classed by Dr. Rieu amongst the most
remarkable of the 352 MSS. which were selected for
purchase out of the 1,000 gathered in by Colonel Hamilton
from Lucknow and Dihli. It does not bear the vermilion

1A passage about Babar (Bib. Ind., edit. I. 87) closely resembles
the begam’s on the same topic; and a divergence, noted by Mr. Erskine
(Mems., 218 n.) as made from Babar’s narrative by Abi'l-fazl, is made
also by the begam.

stamp of the King of Oude, so the surmise is allowed that
it came from Dihh. It has been rebound (not recently, I
believe), plainly, in red leather; and it is unadorned by
frontispiece, margin, or rubric. Whether there has ever
been a colophon cannot be said; the latter pages of the
work are lost. The folio which now stands last is out of
place, an error apparently made in the rebinding. Catch-
words are frequently absent, and there are none on the last
folio. There are blank fly-leaves, prefixed and suftixed, of
paper unlike that of the MS..

The absence of a second MS., and, still more, the
absence of mention of the work, seem to indicate that
few copies ever existed. ,

Dr. Rieu’s tentative estimate of the date of the British
Museum MS. (seventeenth century) does not, I am coun-
selled, preclude the possibility of transcription so late in the
sixteenth century as 1587 (995 H.) onwards. It may be the
first and even sole example.

Gul-badan Begam, as is natural, uses many Turki words,
and at least one Turki phrase. Her scribe (who may be
herself) does not always write these with accuracy; some
run naturally from the pen as well-known words do; some
are laboured in the writing, as though care had to be taken
in the copying or original orthography.

Tirki was Gul-badan’s native language ; it was also her
husband’s; it would be the home speech of her married
life. Persian was an accomplishment. These considera-
tions awaken speculation: Did she compose in Persian ?
or in Turki? That she read Turki is clear from her
upbringing and her references to her father’s book. She
has one almost verbal reproduction of a passage from it
retained in Turki.

The disadvantage of working from a single MS. is felt at
every point, and nowhere more than when the M$. itself
is under consideration.

TRANSLATION

OF THE

-HUMAYUN-NAMA OF GUL-BADAN BEGAM.


--- Page 99 ---
Courtesy www.pdfbooksfree.pk

NOTE ON THE PERSIAN TITLES.

Of these there are two:

1. ‘Humayiin-nama. Written by Gul-badan Begam,
daughter of Babar Padshah.’ This is on the first fly-leaf,
which is of paper differing in colour and texture from that
of the body of the MS., and identical with that of four
blank sheets which are bound up at the end of the M6,
perhaps to allow of writing in the missing portion of the
work.

2. ‘Accounts of Humayun Padshah. Put together by
Gul-badan Begam, a daughter of Babar Padshah and a
paternal aunt of Akbar Padshah.’ This stands on the first

(2b of the Persian text.)

In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compas-
sionate !

There had been an order! issued, ‘ Write down whatever
you know of the doings of Firdaus-makanit and Jannat-
ashyani.’?

At the time when his Majesty Firdaus-makani passed
from this perishable world to the everlasting home, I, this
lowly one, was eight? years old, so it may well be that I
do not remember much. However, in obedience to the
royal command, I set down whatever there is that I have
heard and remember.

First of all, by way of invoking a blessing (on my work),
and in pious commemoration, a chapter (juz%) is written
about my royal father’s deeds, although these are told in
his memoirs.4

1 Probably that mentioned by Abii’l-fazl, as issued for the gathering-
in of material for the Akbar-nima. (H. Beveridge, I. 29.) If so, the
begam’s book dates from about 1587 (995H.). ‘There are indications
of its use by Abi’l-fazl.

2 Babar’s and Humayiin’s posthumous names, ‘ Dwelling’ and ‘ Nest-
ing in Paradise.’ Several women, and notably Akbar’s mother, have
been named after death Maryam-inakdni, ‘Dwelling with Mary.’
Babar’s half-sister, Shahr-bani, is styled by A.F. Bilgis-makdani,—
Bilqis being the Queen of Sheba. Many other examples might be
quoted of the custom which, amongst some savage tribes, takes the
extreme form of total suppression at death of the name borne in life,
and towards which affection and reverence incline the most civilized
peoples.

3 Lunar years. Babar died December 26th, 1530. The begam’s
dates and numerical statements must always be taken lightly.

From his Majesty Sahib-qirant! down to my royal father
there was not one of the bygone princes who laboured as
he did. He became king in his twelfth? year, and the
khutba? was read in his name on June 10th, 1494,‘ in
Andijan, the capital of Farghana. (3a)

For eleven full years his wars and struggles against the
Chaghatai and Timurid and Uzbeg princes® in Mawara’u-
n-nahr (Transoxiana) were such that the tongue of the pen
is too feeble and weak to recount them.

The toils and perils which in the ruling of kingdoms
befell our prince, have been measured out to few, and of
few have been recorded the manliness, courage and en-
durance which he showed in battle-fields and dangers.
Twice he took Samargand by force of the sword. The
first time my royal father was twelve years old, the second
nineteen, the third time he was nearly twenty-two. For
six months he was besieged’ (in Samarqand), and neither
Sultan Husain Mirza Baygra, his paternal uncle,* who

filled in. The Tiz#k-1-babart (Leyden and Erskine: Longman, Rees,
eic., 1826.) will be referred to in these notes as the ‘Memoirs’ or
‘Mems.’. Mr. W. Erskine’s ‘History of India under Babar and
Humiayiin’ will be indicated by ‘B. & H.’.

1 Lord of the fortunate conjunction, t.e., of Jupiter and Venus, a
posthumous title of Timiir (1336-1405), from whom Babar was fifth in
descent.

2 Babar was born February 14th, 1483 (Muharram 6th, 888H.). He
therefore became king of Farghina (Khokand) when 114 years old.

3 The prayer and oration in which it is ordained that the name of
the reigning sovereign should be recited. Cf. Dict. of Islam, Hughes,
s.v.. The histories show that it was formerly so recited in India. The
term ‘ Ruler of the Age’ filled Victoria’s place.

4 Ramzan 5th, 899H. |Text, 909H.].

6 The first and second of this triad of foes were near and elder -

kinsmen; the third was the Shaibani of the histories.

6 Babar occupied Samargand three times. Twice he captured it,
and the third time entered without a blow struck and amidst a popular
welcome. The dates are respectively 1497, 1500, and 1511, and his
age fifteen, seventeen, and twenty-nine.

7 By Shaibani, after the second occupation.

8 ‘ammz. Wusain was of the fourth, and Babar of the fifth degree
of descent from their common ancestor, Timur. Babar’s father was
(anglice) Husain’s fourth cousin. As Husain was of an elder genera-
tion, Babar calls him ‘uncle.’ If ‘tammz were ever used to denote
an uncle by marriage, it would have triple application here, since
Husain married in succession three paternal aunts of Babar—Shahr-

maternal uncle,! who ruled in Kashghar, sent him help.
When none came from any quarter, he grew desperate.”

At this difficult time, Shahi Beg Khan? sent to say: ‘If
you would marry your sister Khanzada Begam‘ to me, (3b) >
there might be peace and a lasting alliance between us.’
At length it had to be done; he gave the begam to the
khan, and came out himself (from Samarqand).6 With 200
followers on foot, wearing long frocks on their shoulders
and peasants’ brogues on their feet, and carrying clubs in
their hands,—in this plight, unarmed, and relying on God,
he went towards the lands of Badakhshan (Badakhshanat)
and Kabul.®

Khusrau Shah’s’ people and army were in Kunduz and
the Badakhshanat. He came and paid his respects to his
Majesty,® my father, who, being as he was manly and
kind and generous, did not in any way touch the question
of retaliation, although Khusrau Shah had committed such
crimes as the martyrdom of Bayasanghar Mirza and the
blinding of Sultan Masud Mirza, both of whom were sons
of my royal father’s paternal uncle. In addition to this,

to cross his country, he was watched and rudely driven
out. Now he was pleased to command that Khusrau Shah
should take whatever his heart desired of his (own) jewels
and golden vessels, and so he got leave to go to Khurasan
in kindness and safety, and took with him five or six
strings of camels and five or six of baggage mules.! (4a)

His Majesty now set out for Kabul, which was occupied
by Muhammad Mugim, a son of Zi’l-niin Arghiin, and
grandfather of Nahid Begam.? He had captured it after
Ulugh Beg Mirza’s* death from Mirza ‘Abdu-r-razzaq, son
of his Majesty’s paternal uncle (Ulugh Beg).

His Majesty reached Kabul in safety. Muhammad
Muqim kept command for a few days, and then by pact
and agreement made over charge to the royal servants, and
went off with goods and chattels to his father in Qandahar.
This was in the last ten days of Rabi II., 910H.* Being
now master of Kabul, his Majesty went to Bangash, took it
at a blow, and returned to Kabul.

Her Highness, the khanam,* his Majesty’s mother, had
fever for six days, and then departed from this fleeting
world to the eternal home. They laid her in the New Year’s
Garden. His Majesty paid 1,000 coined misqal to his
kinsmen, the owners of the garden, and laid her there.

At this time urgent letters arrived from Sultan Husain
Mirza, saying: (4b) ‘I am planning a war against the Uzbegs.
It would be excellent if you came too.’ My royal father

scribe the time of her father’s military incursions, made when he was
trying to carve out a ruler’s seat.

1The begam’s brevity makes Babar’s capacity and forbearance
seem alike remarkable. He had gathered a force, and safety was the
‘ condition of Khusrau’s surrender (1504). Mr. Erskine writes (B. &
H., I. 208.) : ‘ Babar, whose abhorrence of Khusrau was as deep as it
was just, ordered his treasurer to send back the treasure, horses, and
whatever had been presented to him, just as they were; although,
says our author (Mirza Haidar), the King had only one horse suitable
for a person of his rank, and that was used by his mother.’

sought counsel of God. At length he set out to join the
mirza. On the way news came that the mirza was dead.
His Majesty’s amirs represented that, this being so, it was ;
advisable to return to Kabul, but he replied: ‘As we have—___
come so far, we will carry our condolences to the princes.’ i
In the end he went on towards Khurasan.!
When the princes? heard of the royal visit, they one and
all set out to give him honourable meeting, except Badi‘u- .
z-zaman Mirza, who did not go because Barandtq Beg
and Zi’l-niin Beg—amirs of Sultan Husain Mirza—said, in
effect, that as his Majesty was fifteen years younger than
Badi‘u-z-zaman Mirza, it was right that he should be the
first to bow, and that they should then embrace one
another. Qasim Beg? rejoined: ‘ Younger he is by years,
but by the tura,t he has precedence because he has more
than once taken Samargqand by force of the sword.’ (5a)
At length they agreed that his Majesty should bow on
coming in, and that Badi‘u-z-zaman should then advance
to show him honour, and they should embrace. The
mirza was not attending when his Majesty came in at the
door ; Qasim Beg clutched my royal father’s girdle and :
pulled it, and said to Barandiq Beg and Zi’l-nin Beg:
‘The agreement was that the mirza should come forward
and that then they should embrace one another.’ The
prince then advanced in great agitation and they embraced.
As long as his Majesty was in Khurasan, each one of
the princes showed him hospitality, and feasts were
arranged, and excursions to all the gardens and places of

interest. They set forth to him the inconvenience of
winter, and said: ‘ Wait till it is over, and we will fight
the Uzbegs.’ But they could not in any way settle about
the war. Eighty years' long had Sultan Husain Mirza
kept Khurasan safe and sound, but the mirzas could not
fill their father’s place for six months. When his Majesty
saw that they were careless” about his expenses and revenue,
he went to Kabul on the pretext of seeing the places he had
assigned to himself. (5) Much snow had fallen that year.
They took the wrong road. His Majesty and Qasim Beg
chose one® because of its shortness, but the amirs had
given other advice, and when this was not taken, they all
left him without a thought for him. He and Qasim
Beg and his sons made a road in two or three days by
removing the snow, and the people of the army followed.
So they reached Ghirband. Some Hazara rebels having
met his Majesty here, there was fighting; and cattle and
sheep and goods without number belonging to the Hazara
fell into the hands of his people. Then they started for
Kabul with their enormous booty.

At the skirts of Minar Hill they heard that Mirza Khan*
and Mirzé Muhammad Husain Gdurkan' had rebelled and

1A well-rounded number. Sultan Husain was born 842H. (1488),
and died 911H. (1506). Babar calls the joint-kingship of his sons a
strange arrangement and one never heard of, and quotes Sa‘di’s well-
known couplet as applicable—‘ Ten darvishes can sleep on one rug, but
one climate cannot hold two kings.’

2 While on the Murgh-ab, Babar agreed to winter in Khurasan, and he
.went with the joint-kings to Herat in order to see the ‘sights’ of that
renowned city. He certainly worked hard, for he names some fifty-
two which he saw in twenty days. The invitation to winter was
repeated, but neither quarters nor suitable conveniences (? revenues)
were allotted. Bibar delicately says he could not explain his real
motive for not remaining, and left under pressure of necessity on
December 24th, 1506, after snow had fallen along a route which was a
month’s ordinary journey.

It was during this absence from Kabul that he married Maham,
Humiyiin’s mother.

were holding Kabul. His Majesty sent a comforting and
cheering letter (to his friends in the fort), and said: ‘ Be of

good heart! I too am here. (6a) I will light a fire on the

Hill of the Moon-faced Lady; do you light one on the
Treasury, so that I may be sure you know of our coming. ———~
In the morning we will fall on the enemy, you from that

side and we from this.’ But he had fought and won before

the people of the fort came out.

Mirza Khan hid himself in his mother’s house; she was
his Majesty’s maternal aunt. Mirza Muhammad Husain
was in his wife’s house. She was his Majesty’s younger
maternal aunt. He flung himself down on a carpet, and
in fear of his life cried to a servant, ‘Fasten it up!’ His
Majesty’s people heard of this. They took him out of the
carpet and brought him to the presence. In the end, his
Majesty forgave the mirzas their offences, for the sake of
his aunts. He used to go, in his old fashion, in and out
of his aunts’ houses, and showed them more and more
affection, so that no mist of trouble might dim their hearts.
He assigned them places and holdings in the plain-
country. (6b)

God the most High, having freed Kabul from the power
of Mirza Khan, committed it to my royal father’s care. He
was then twenty-three years old? and had no child and greatly
desired one. In his seventeenth year a girl? had been born
to him by ‘Ayisha Sultan Begam, a daughter of Sultan
Ahmad Mirza, but she had died in a month. The most
high God blessed the taking of Kabul, for after it eighteen
children were born. (1.) Of my Lady (Akdam*) who was
Maham Begam there were born his Majesty the Emperor

Mirza, died in childbed. The mother’s name they gave to

(4.) Of Dil-dar Begam were born Gul-rang Begam, and
Gul-chihra Begam, and Hindal Mirza, and Gul-badan
Begam, and Alwar Mirza.

. In short, in taking Kabul he got a good omen. All his
children were born there except two begams who were born
in Khost, viz., Mihr-jan Begam, a daughter of Maham
Begam, and Gul-rang, a daughter of Dil-dar Begam. (7a)

The blessed birth of the Emperor Humayan, the first-born
son of his Majesty Firdaus-makani, occurred in the night
of Tuesday, Zu’l-qada 4th, 918H. (March 6th, 1508), in the
citadel of Kabul, and when the sun was in the sign Pisces.

That same year his Majesty was pleased to order the
amirs and the rest of the world to style him emperor
(badshah). For before the birth of the Emperor Humayin
he had been named and styled Mirza Babar. All kings’
sons were called mirzis. In the year of his Majesty
Humayin’s birth he styled himself badshah.

They found*® the date of the birth in Sultan Humayin
Khan, and also in Shah-(i)-ftroz-qadr.4

After children had been born to him, news came that
Shah Isma‘il had killed Shahi Beg Khan.>
(Cf. Vambéry’s ‘ Cagataische Sprach-studien.’) Babar uses the word
(Mems. 208.), and Mr. Erskine suggests to read ‘ My Lady.’

5 At Merv, December 2nd, 1510. Cf. B. & H., I. 302. On the
removal of this formidable foe, Babar again tried to regain his ancestral

lands, but was still outmatched by the Uzbegs. Defeat by them led
him to take a road of less resistance through Bajaur to Hindistan.

His Majesty at this time entrusted Kabul to Nasir! Mirza,
and set out? for Samarqand, taking with him his people and
wives and children, who were Humayun Mirza, and Mihr-
jahan Begam, and Barbul Mirza, and Mastma Begam, and
Kamran Mirza. (7b) —

With help from Shah Ismail, he took Samarqand
(October, 1511), and for eight (lunar) months the whole of
Mawara’u-n-nahr (Transoxiana) was in his power. Owing
to want of co-operation in his brothers and to the oppo-
sition of the Mughals,’ he was defeated at Kul Malik by
‘Ubaidu-l-lah Khan. As he could not remain in those
parts, he set out for Badakhshan and Kabul, and put out
of his head further thought of Mawara’u-n-nahr.

He had become master of Kabul in 910H. (1504). He
had always desired to go into Hindustan, and had not
carried out his wish because of the feeble counsels of his
amirs and the non-agreement of his brothers. When at
length these were gone,* and there remained no amir such
as could argue against it, he accomplished his desire.

Bajaur® he took in two or three hours and ordered a
general massacre.

On the same day the father of Afghani dghacha,® Malik ;
Mansir Yusufzai, came in and paid his respects. (82) His
Majesty took his daughter in marriage and then gave him
leave to depart. He bestowed on him a horse and a suit
of honour befitting a ruler, and said to him: ‘Go and

4¢.e.,dead. Jahangir died in 1507 and Nasir in 1515, both from
drinking. This passage resembles Babar’s own words. (Mems. 309.)

5 Gul-badan is confusingly brief. Bajaur was attacked 925H. (1519)
on the way to India, and its people put to the sword because they were
‘rebels to followers of Islam’ and addicted to infidel customs.
(Mems. 246 e¢ seq. .)

6 The Afghan Lady. It is thus that Gul-badan always speaks of Bibi
(Lady) Mubarika, the Yisufzai wife of Babar. Pavet de Courteille
defines aghacha thus: ‘Se dit des femmes par opposition 4 begam et
khanam; dame.’ I do not in Gul-badan’s work trace any disrespect
attaching to ‘aghdcha,’ such as is indicated by ‘ concubine,’ as which
it is sometimes translated.

bring men and labourers, etc., to your native land and
cultivate it.’

Qasim Beg,! who was in Kabul, sent a letter saying:
‘Another prince has been born. I have ventured to write
as an omen of the conquest of Hind and of taking its
throne. As for the rest, the Emperor is master, whatever
is his pleasure” (let it be done). In an auspicious hour
his Majesty named him Mirza Hindal.

Having subdued Bajaur, his Majesty went towards the
Bhira country, and on his arrival made peace without
plundering. He took four laks of shahrukhis? and gave to
his army, dividing them according to the number of his
followers. He then set out for Kabul.*

Just now came a letter from Badakhshan saying: ‘ Mirza
Khan is dead ;5 Mirza Sulaiman is young; the Uzbegs are
near ; take thought for this kingdom lest (which God forbid)
Badakhshan should be lost.’ (8b) Until there should be
thought taken, Mirza Sulaiman’s mother® had brought him
(to the Emperor). Agreeably to this petition and their
wish, the Emperor assigned to Mirza Sulaiman the lands
and inheritance which had been his father’s, and he gave
Badakhshan to Mirza Humayin.

The mirza set out for his province. His Majesty and
my Lady (Akam) followed and also went to Badakhshan,
and there spent several days together. The mirza remained

4 End of February, 1519. In his winning fashion Babar relates that
he forbade the news of his return to be taken to Kabul, and that there
was therefore no time to put his boys, Humaytn and Kamran, on
horseback, and that they were carried out in the arms of the nearest
servants to offer their duty on his return, to a place between the fort
gates and the citadel.

and my royal father and my Lady came back to Kabul’
(926H.—1520).

After a time his Majesty set out for Qilat and Qandahar.?

He was victorious at once in Qilat, and went on to Qanda-__———
har and kept its garrison shut up for a year and a half.
Then, by the Divine favour and after great fighting and
skirmishing, he captured it. Much gold fell into his
hands, and he gave moneys and camels to his soldiers and
the people of the army. Qandahar he bestowed on Mirza
Kamran, and himself set off for Kabul.

His advance camp having been set up,® he crossed the
hill of Yak Langa, and gloriously alighted in the valley of
Dih-i-ya'qub on Friday, Safar 1st, 932H. (November 17th,
1525), when the sun was in Sagittarius. (92) He spent the
following day there, and on the next set forth, march by
march, for Hindistan. In the seven or eight years since
925H. (1519)* the royal army had several times renewed the
attempt on Hindustan. Hach time it used to conquer lands
and districts, such as Bhira, Bajaur, Sialkut, Dipalpir,
Lahor, etc., up to the fifth time, when on Safar 1st, 932H.,
his Majesty went, march by march, from his glorious en-
camping in Dih-i-ya‘qub towards Hindustan. He conquered
Lahor and Sirhind, and every country that lay on his
path.

On Friday, Rajab 8th, 932H. (April 20th, 1526), he

so far as Badakhshan. That his parents went with him is one of Gul-
badan’s life-giving touches. Aka@m may now well have shown her

1.0. MS., 26a.)

2 Held now by Shah Beg Arghin, father of Shah Husain, Humayin’s
later enemy in Sind. Firishta gives three years as the duration of the
siege, Khafi Khan four years, and Mirza Haidar five years. The
occurrence unfortunately coincides with one of the gaps in the Memoirs.
This was Babar’s culminating attempt on Qandahar; his first being
in 1505,—this one seems to have ended in 1522 (928H.).

3 Gul-badan, by a sudden transition, passes over some three years,
and, as it seems, using her father’s Memoirs, enters on the account
of his last and successful expedition to Hindistan. Yak Langa is a hill
between Kabul and Butkhak, and on the road to Jalalabad.

arrayed battle at Panipat! against Sultan Ibrahim, son of
Sultan Sikandar, son of Bahlil Lodt. By God’s grace he
was victorious, and Sultan Ibrahim was killed in the fight.
His victory was won purely by the Divine grace, for
Sultan Ibrahim had a lak and 80,000 horse, and as many
as 1,500 head of fierce elephants; (9b) while his Majesty's
army with the traders and good and all (badr (?) bad, bad)
was 12,000 persons and he had, at the outside, 6,000 or
7,000 serviceable men.
The treasures of five kings fell into his hands. He gave
everything away. The amirs of Hind represented that in
Hindistan it was thought disgraceful to expend the treasure
of bygone kings, and that people rather added and added to
it, while his Majesty, on the contrary, had given all away.”
Khwaja® Kilan* Beg asked leave several times to go to
Kabul. He said: ‘My constitution is not fitted for the
climate of Hindustan. If leave were given, I should tarry
awhile in Kabul.’ His Majesty was not at all, at all
willing for him to go, but at last gave permission because
he saw him so very urgent. He said: ‘When you go, I
shall send some of the valuable presents and curiosities of
Hind which fell into our hands through the victory over

1¢A far-reaching, almost illimitable level tract, broken only by insig- —
nificant undulations. Here and there, where the shallow soil is
moistened from some niggardly watercourse, grow sparse grasses and
stunted thorn-bushes. But, for the most part, the eye falls only on
the uniform yellowish-gray waste of sterile earth. Everywhere empty
silence reigns, and it would almost seem as if this desert had been
designed for the battlefield of nations.’ (Emperor Akbar, F. v. Noer.,
trs. A.S.B. I. 74.)

Thrice in modern times a decisive battle has been fought out here:
(1) by Babar against Ibrahim and the Lodis, 1526; (2) by Akbar
against the Indian Afghans in 1556; and (3) by Ahmad Shah Durrani
against the Marathas in 1761.

2 Babar distributed the treasure on the 11th or 12th of May, 1526, |
and left himself so little that he was dubbed qalandar.

3M. Garcin de Tassy says, in his ‘Mémoire sur la Religion Musal-
mane’ (46 n.) that khwaja, like sayyid, is a title for a descendant of
Muhammad. Shaw’s Turki Dictionary states that khwaja is applied
to the offspring of a sayyid by a woman of another family, also to
their descendants. I find many instances where both titles are applied

_ to the same man.

arelation. He was one of seven brothers, sonsof Maulani Muhammad .
Sadru-d-din, who spent their lives in Babar’s service. ,

Sultan Ibrahim, to my elder relations’ and sisters and each
person of the haram. You take them. I shall write a list,
and you will distribute them according to it. (10a) You
will order a tent with a screen to be set up in the Garden
of the Audience Hall for each begam,? and when a pleasant
meeting-place has been arranged, the begams are to make
the prostration of thanks for the complete victory which
has been brought about.

‘To each begam is to be delivered as follows: one special
dancing-girl of the dancing-girls of Sultan Ibrahim, with
one gold plate full of jewels—ruby and pearl, cornelian and
diamond, emerald and turquoise, topaz and cat’s-eye—and
two small mother-o’-pearl trays full of ashrafis, and on
two other trays shahrukhis,’ and all sorts of stuffs by nines—
that is, four trays and one plate. Take a dancing-girl and
another plate of jewels, and one each of ashrafis and
shahrukhis, and present, in accordance with my directions,
to my elder relations the very plate of jewels and the self-
same dancing-girl which I have given for them. I have
made other gifts ;* convey these afterwards. (10b) Let
them divide and present jewels and ashrafis and shah-
rukhis and stuffs to my sisters and children and the
harams® and kinsmen, and to the begams and aghas® and

1 waliyu-n-ni'matdn, lords of beneficence. Gul-badan’s application
of it is to ‘ benevolent ladies,’ z.¢., the numerous aunts. It is a title of
respect for seniors.

2 T think each begam was to encamp with her own establishment and
within her own enclosure (sardparda), and not in hasty camp-fashion
of community of quarters. This would exalt the assembly.

The saraparda or enclosing canvas wall, run at optional distance
round tents, was, it is stated in the Ma’asiru-r-rahimi, invented by
Bairam Khdn-i-khdndn, and if this is true, it must at this date have
been a quite modern convenience.

* Tt is waste of time to try to estimate the amount of these money
gifts, made as they were in coins of uncertain value and recorded,
probably on hearsay, more than fifty years after bestowal. Mr. Erskine
puts the shahrukhi at from 10d. to 1s., Steingass, s.v.ashrafi, gives
for its value about 16 rupis, presumably of undegenerated rank.

* Qy., for the elder relations.

5 Presumably of his kinsmen and of officers whose families were with
Babar’s own in Kabul.

departments and not merely the guardians of harams.

nurses and foster-brethren and ladies, and to all who
pray for me.’ The gifts were made according to the
list.

Three happy days they remained together in the Audience
Hall Garden. They were uplifted by pride, and recited
the fatiha! for the benediction and prosperity of his
Majesty, and joyfully made the prostration of thanks.?

The Emperor sent by Khwaja Kilan a large ashrafi,?
which weighed three imperial s?, that is, fifteen sir of
Hind, for . . . ‘Asas.* He said to the Khwaja: ‘If ‘Asas
asks you, ‘‘What has the Emperor sent for me?’ say,
“One ashrafi,”’ as there really was only one. ‘Asas was
amazed, and fretted about it for three days. His Majesty
had ordered that a hole should be bored in the ashrafi, and
that “Asas should be blindfolded and the ashraft hung
round his neck, and that then he was to be sent into the
haram. The hole was bored and the ashraft hung round
his neck. He was quite helpless with surprise at its
weight, and delighted and-very, very happy. He took it
in both hands, and wondered over it and said, ‘No one
shall get my ashrafi.’ Hach begam, too, gave (? him) ten or
twelve ashraf?, so he had seventy or eighty. (11a)

After Khwaja Kilan Beg had started for Kabul, the
Emperor made gifts in Agra to his Majesty Humayun and

4 Lit. a night-guard. The words preceding ‘Asas offer much diffi-
culty. They may be read ba ‘ammiu,—to the paternal uncle of ‘Asas.
But the story is of ‘Asas, the night-guard and not of his uncle. Perhaps
‘ammié is a clerical error for ‘amah, bewilderment, misleading, and
this would suit the story well. Mr. Beveridge has suggested to me to
read ‘Umari, %.e., an old servant of ‘Umar Shaikh. This, too,
would be appropriate, for the victim of the hoax is clearly an old

man.

The title ‘Asas is applied several times by Babar. One ‘Asas was a
boon companion and partook of Babar’s vow before the battle of
Khanwa. (Mems. 283 and 354; Firishta, Pers. Text, Briggs I. 449.)
Gul-badan names one (200) as entrusted with the care of Babar’s
tomb,—Muh. ‘Ali ‘Asas. I think he was brother to Maham Begam,
and the governor of Kabul whom Kamran murdered in 1547.

to all the mirzaés and sultans and amirs. He sent letters
in all directions, urgently saying, ‘We shall take into
full favour all who enter our service, and especially such
as served our father and grandfather and ancestors. If
such will come to us, they will receive fitting benefits.
Whoever there may be of the families of Sahib-qiran~and
Chingiz Khan, let them turn towards our court. The most
High has given us sovereignty in Hindustan; let them
come that we may see prosperity together.’

Seven! daughters of Sultan Abi-said came (to Hindi-
stan): Guhar-shad Begam, and Fakhr-jahan Begam, and
Khadija Sultan Begam, and Badi‘u-l-jamal Begam, and
Aq Begam, and Sultan Bakht Begam.

(Also) Zainab Sultan Khanam, daughter of his Majesty’s
maternal uncle, Sultan Mahmud Khan, and Muhibb Sultan
Khanam,? daughter of Ilacha Khan (Ahmad), his Majesty’s
younger maternal uncle.

In short, all the begams and khanams went, ninety-six
persons in all, and all received houses and lands and gifts
to their heart’s desire. (110)

All through the four years that (my father) was in Agra
he used to go on Fridays to see his paternal aunts. One
day it was extremely hot, and her Highness my lady
(Aka@m) said, ‘The wind is very hot, indeed; how would
it be if you did not go this one Friday? The begams
would not be vexed.’ His Majesty said, ‘Maham! it is
astonishing that you should say such things! The
daughters of Abu-said Sultan Mirza, who have been
deprived of father and brothers! If I do not cheer them,
how will it be done?”

To the architect, Khwaja Qasim, his Majesty gave the
following order: ‘We command a piece of good service
from you. It is this: whatever work, even if it be on a
great scale, our paternal aunts may order done in their

palace, give it precedence, and carry it out with might and
main.’

He commanded buildings to be put up in Agra on the
other side of the river,! and a stone palace to be built for
himself between the haram and the garden. He also had
one built in the audience court, with a reservoir in the
middle and four chambers in the four towers. On the
river’s bank he had a chaukandi? built. (12a)

He ordered a tank made in Dholpur, ten by ten,* out of
a single mass of rock, and used to say, ‘When it is
finished, I will fill it with wine.’ But as he had given up
wine before the fight with Rana Sanga, he filled it with
lemonade.

A year after Sultan Ibrahim’s death, the rana‘ appeared
from the Mandi (or Hindu) side with a countless host.
Amirs and rajas and ranas, every one of those who had
come earlier and paid duty to his Majesty, now became an
enemy and went and joined the rana, until Kul-jalali and
Sambhal and Rapri—every pargana,—and rais and rajas
and Afghans became hostile. Nearly two laks of cavalry
assembled. ;

At this time, Muhammad Sharif, the astrologer, said to
the royal soldiers, ‘It would be best for the Emperor not to
fight, for the constellation Sakkiz Yildoz (Hight Stars) is
opposite.’ Amazing perturbation fell upon the royal army.
They became exceedingly anxious and troubled,’ and showed
signs of cowardice. (12) When his Majesty saw his army

4 This decisive battle was fought on March 16th, 1527, on the skirts
of the hill of Sikri, at Khanwa. Akbar’s prenomen of Fathiptr—
the City of Victory—was given to Sikri in 1573 to commemorate the
Gujrat campaign.

5 When the fight had been won, Babar soundly rated Muhammad
Sharif, gave him money, and dismissed him to the place from which
he had emerged, apparently only to cause trouble. He had come to
India with a royal kinsman from Kabul, and to Kabul in 1519 from
Khost (Maham’s home).

in this state, he thought over the whole position. As the
enemy was close at hand, this device occurred to his
blessed mind; he ordered the remnant of what remained
over and above deserters and enemies, to gather together.———~
One and all came—amirs and khins and sultans; plebeian
and noble, low and high. Then he addressed them, and
said: ‘Do you not know that there lies a journey of some
months between us and the land of our birth and our
familiar city? If our side is defeated, (God preserve us
from that day! God forbid it!) where are we? where
is our birthplace? where our city? We have to do with
strangers and foreigners. It is in every way best for
each man to set resolutely before himself the two alterna-
tives: if we win, we are avengers of the cause of God; if
we lose, we die martyrs. In either fate is our salvation ;
each is a step and upward stage in greatness.’
To this they all agreed. They swore by the divorce of
their wives and on the Holy Book; they recited the fatiha,
and said, ‘O King! God willing, we will not spare our-
selves in sacrifice and devotion, so long as there are breath
and life in our bodies.”! (13a) -
Two days before the battle his Majesty renounced wine,
and, indeed, he forswore all forbidden things. Following
his example, 400 young men of name, who had given proof
of manliness and one-mindedness and friendship, also
renounced these things when he did. His Majesty broke
up all forbidden utensils,—vessels of gold and of silver,
goblets and flasks, etc.; and he gave them to the poor and
needy.
He also sent abroad firmans with the announcement:
_ ‘We exempt (you) from all dues and octroi and tithe on
corn, and from all illegal imposts, so that no one, trader or

1 Mr, Erskine thus gives Babar’s words: ‘Every man dies. God
only survives unchangeable. He who comes to life’s feast must
drink the parting cup of death. How much better to die with honour
than to live with infamy !’

Perhaps, as Gul-badan says, Babar touched also the thought of home,
and this would be recorded by the woman.

other, may be hampered in his comings and goings, but all
may move unmolested and free from interference.’

In the night! before the battle word was brought that
Qasim Husain Sultan,—a grandson of Sultan Husain Mirza
through a daughter, ‘Ayisha Sultan Begam,—had come
to within ten kos (of the royal camp) on his way from
Khurasan. (13))

This news delighted his Majesty greatly. He asked,
‘How many men are with him?’ When he heard ‘thirty
or forty,’ he at once sent off 1,000 troopers, all armed and
equipped, at midnight, so that they might march in again
with Qasim Husain Sultan, and in this way the enemy and
outsiders be let know that reinforcements had come in good
time. Everyone who heard the plan thought it a good one.

Next morning, which was March 16th, 1527 (Jumada II.
[18th], 983H.), his Majesty arrayed battle against Rana
Sanga on the skirts of the hill of Sikri, where now Fathpur
has been built? and peopled. By the Divine grace he was
victorious and became an avenger of the cause of God.®

A year later my lady (akam), who was Maham Begam,
came from Kabul to Hindistan. I, this insignificant one,
came with her in advance of my sisters, and paid my duty to
my royal father. When my lady reached Kul(-jalali—i.e.,
‘Alighar), his Majesty had sent two litters with three
horsemen. (14a) She went on post-haste from Kil to Agra.
His Majesty had intended to go as far as Kil-jalali to meet
her. At evening-prayer time some one came and said to
him: ‘I have just passed her Highness on the road, four
miles out.’ My royal father did not wait for a horse to be

My royal father’s Khalifa® with his wife Sultanam’ came
as far as Naugram® to meet (us). My mdmds® had made
me alight at the Little Garden, and having spread a small
carpet, seated me on it. They instructed me to rise when
Khalifa came in, and to embrace him. When he came, I
rose and embraced him. Then his wife Sultanam came in

mother of Nadim Khwaja kika. She is several times mentioned, and
it appears from a MS. belonging to Colonel Hanna which Mr.
Beveridge has examined, that she was mother-in-law of the celebrated
Maham anaga who was Nadim’s wife.

too. (140) I, not knowing, wished to get up, but Khalifa
raised objections, and said: ‘She is your old serving-
woman. There is no need to rise for her. Your father has
exalted this old servant (? himself) by giving such an order!
about him. So be it! what power have slaves ?’

From Khalifa I accepted 6,000 shahrukhis and five horses,
and Sultanam gave me 3,000 and three horses. Then she
said: ‘A hasty meal (ma hazart) is ready. If you will eat
you will honour your servants.’ I consented. There was
a raised platform in a pleasant spot, and a pavilion of red
cloth with lining of Gujrati brocade, and six canopies of
cloth and brocade, each of a (differing) colour, and a square
enclosure? of cloth with painted poles.

I sat in Khalifa’s quarters. The meal drew out ta almost
. fifty roast sheep,’ and bread and sherbet and much fruit.
Having at length eaten my breakfast, I got into my litter
and went and paid my duty to my royal father. (152)

I fell at his feet; he asked me many questions, and took
me for a time in his arms, and then this insignificant
person felt such happiness that greater could not be
imagined.

When we had been in Agra three months, the Emperor
’ went to Dholpir. Her Highness Maham Begam and this

lowly person also went. A tank had been made there, ten
(gaz) by ten, out of one piece (of rock). From Dholpir his
Majesty went on to Sikri. He ordered a great platform
made in the middle of the tank, and when it was ready, he
‘used to go and sit on it, or to row about. This platform
still exists.
They also made a chaukandi in the Sikri garden, and my

Cf. anglice ‘heaps of, ‘hundreds of, etc. Perhaps the flock is a
product of childish weariness recalled half a century later. Possibly
one should read panj ahar, five foods, t.e., courses, dishes. Gul-badan is
now between five and six. Her doubt as to the reception due to Sul-
tanam rings true, and Khalifa’s words suggest a little play-acting to
please the small traveller; he treated her like a grown-up, and she
tried to act one.

royal father put up in it a tur-khana,! where he used to sit
and write his book.?

I and Afghani aghacha were sitting in the front of the
’ lower storey when my lady went to prayers. I said to
Afghani dghdcha: ‘Pull my hand.’ She pulled, and my——_
hand came out. My strength went and I cried. (15b) Then -
they brought the bone-setter and when he had bound up
my hand, the Emperor went to Agra.
_ After his arrival, word was brought that the begams were
on the way from Kabul. My royal father went as far as
Naugram to give honourable reception to my dearest
lady (aka-janam),? who was my oldest paternal aunt and
my royal father’s eldest sister. All the begams who had
come with her, paid their duty to the Emperor in her
quarters. They were very happy and made the prostration
of thanks, and then set off for Agra. The Emperor gave
houses to all the begams.

A few days later he made an excursion to the Gold-
scattering Garden (Bagh-i-zar-afshan). There was a place
in it for ablution before prayers. When he saw it, he said:
‘My heart is bowed down by ruling and reigning; I will
retire to this garden. As for attendance, Tahir the ewer- .
bearer will amply suffice. I will make over the kingdom °
to Humayin.’ On this my lady (akdm) and all his
children broke down, and said with tears: ‘God keep you
in His own peace upon the throne many, many years,
and may all your children after you reach a good old
age !’ (16a)

A few days later Alwar Mirza fell ill. His illness led to
an affection of the bowels, which grew worse and worse in
spite of all that the doctors could do, and at last he passed
from this transitory world to the eternal home. His
Majesty was very sad and sorry, and Alwar’s mother,
Dil-dar Begam, was wild with grief for the child, who was a

rarity of the world and unique of theage. As her lamenta-
tion passed due bounds, his Majesty said to my lady and
the begams: ‘ Come, let us make an excursion to Dholpur.’
He himself went comfortably and pleasantly by water, and
the begams also begged to go by boat.

Just then there came a letter from Maulana Muhammad
Farghari (Parghali) in Dihli, saying: ‘Humayiin Mirza is
ill and in an extraordinary state. Her Highness the begam
should come at once to Dihli, for the mirz& is much
prostrated.”! (16d)

My lady was very much upset on hearing this news,
and started for Dihli, like one athirst who is far from the
waters. They met in Mathura. To her experienced eye
he seemed ten times weaker and more alarmingly ill than
she had heard he was. From Mathura the two, mother
and son, like Jesus and Mary, set out for Agra. When
they arrived, this insignificant one went with her own
sisters to visit that royal angel of goodness.

He was then growing weaker and weaker. Every time
he came to his senses, his pearl-dropping tongue asked for
us, and said: ‘Sisters, yOu are welcome! Come, and let
us embrace one another. I have not embraced you.’ It
might be three times that he raised his head and that his
jewel-dropping tongue let fall these uplifting words.

When his Majesty came and saw how it was, his light-
revealing countenance at once became sad and pitiful, and
he began more and more to show signs of dread. (17a) On
this my lady said: ‘Do not be troubled about my son.
You are a king; what griefs have you? You have other
sons. I sorrow because I have only this one.? His
Majesty rejoined: ‘Maham! although I have other sons,
I love none as I love your Humayin. I crave that this

cherished child may have his heart’s desire and live long,
and I desire the kingdom for him and not for the others,
because he has not his equal in distinction.’

During Humayun’s illness' his Majesty walked round_
him and turned his face (in intercession) to his Reverence,
Murtaza ‘Ali Karimu-l-lah. He kept up that going-round
from the Wednesday and made intercession from the
Tuesday, in anxiety and deep dejection. The weather
was extremely hot and his heart and liver burned. While
going round he prayed, saying in effect: ‘O God! if a life
may be exchanged for a life, I who am Babar, I give my
life and my being for Humayun.”

That very day he fell ill, and Humayun poured water on
his head, and came out and gave audience. (17b) Because
of his illness, they carried my royal father within, and he
kept his bed for two or three months.

As he grew worse, a messenger was sent to summon his
Majesty Humayun, who had gone towards Kalinjar. He
came post-haste, and on paying his duty to the Emperor,
noticed that he was very feeble. Filled with compassion,
he began to break down, and kept saying to the attendants:
‘How has he come to such a lamentable pass all at once ?”
He sent for the doctors, and said to them: ‘I left him well.
What has happened all at once?’ They said this and that
in reply.

1 The account of Babar’s self-surrender which follows is somewhat
puzzling to translate, but the sense is clear and the important state-
ments are in accordance with other sources.

2 One of Kehr’s (Ilminsky’s) ‘ fragments ’ (which, if it be not Babar’s
own, it is not improbable was added to the T#zuk by Jahangir) tells
this story in Babar’s person. After rejection of the suggestion to
sacrifice for Humayin’s life the great diamond (? the Koh-t-nzr), the
narrative continues (P. de C., IT. 460.): ‘J’entrai dans la chambre ou il
se tenait, et je tournai trois fois autour de lui, en commencant par la
téte et en disant, ‘‘J’assume sur moi tout ce que tu souffres.” En
méme instant je me sentis tout alourdi, tandis que lui se trouvait
léger et dispos. Il se leva en pleine santé, et moi je m’affaissai, accablé
de malaise.’

Faith in the rite of cireumambulation still prevails in Persia. Babar,
it is clear, believed his devotion to have borne fruit. (Cf. Hughes,
Dict. of Islam, s.v. Intercession. For Karimu-1-lah, see Badayuni, Bib.
Ind. Text, III. 191.).

The whole time my royal father kept repeating : ‘ Where
is Hindal? What is he doing?’ Just at this time
some-one came in and said: ‘Mir Bardi Beg, the son
of Mir Khurd Beg,! conveys his obeisance.’ My royal
father, full of agitation, sent for him at once and asked:
‘Where is Hindal? When will he come? What trouble
waiting gives!’ (18a) Mir Bardi said: ‘The fortunate prince
has reached Dihli; he will wait on you to-day or to-morrow.’
On this my royal father said to Mir Bardi Beg: ‘IIl-
fated little fellow! I have heard that they married your
sister in Kabul, and you in Lahor.? It is because of the
wedding festivities that you have (not)? sooner brought my
son, and so my weary waiting has been very long.’ He
asked: ‘How tall has Hindal Mirza grown?’ and ‘ What is
he like?’ As Mir Bardi was wearing one of the mirza’s
dresses, he showed it and said: ‘This is a robe of the
prince which he bestowed on his servant.’ His Majesty
called him nearer and said: ‘ Let me see how tall and how
big Hindal has grown. He kept repeating, ‘Alas! a
thousand times alas! that I do not see Hindal,’ and asking
everyone who came in: ‘ When will Hindal come ?’

During his illness, he laid a command on my lady, and
said: ‘ Marriages ought to be arranged for Gul-rang Begam
and Gul-chihra Begam. (18b) When the royal aunt, my elder
sister,> honours me with a visit, tell her that I say it has
occurred to me to give Gul-rang to Isan-timur Sultan and
Gul-chihra to Tukhta-bigha Sultan.’®

1 Hindal’s guardian from birth (1519-1530). He had previously
been Babar’s bakdwal (house-steward). One of his sons, Khwaja Tahir
Muhammad, served under Humayin and Akbar, and was mir faraghat
(master of comfort). He may be the Mir Bardi (qy. a child’s sobriquet,
Master Full-of-fun) of this episode. Tahir’s son, Baqi, was a sewer,
1.¢., table-decker (sufra-chi).

* Hindal, with whom doubtless Mir Bardi and his father were
travelling, was on his way from Badakhshan to the court.

3 The text has no negative.

4 Hindal was now about eleven years old, so Mir Bardi must also
have been a boy.

5 Khanzada Begam—aka-janam—dearest lady.

6 Isan (Ishan, or Yussun) was the ninth, and Tikhta-bigha the
tenth, son of Ahmad Khan, Babar’s maternal uncle. They were uncles
of Gul-badan’s own husband, Khizr Khwaja.

Dearest lady, the smiling one,! came, and they said to
her: ‘The Emperor spoke in this manner, and it has
occurred to him in sucha way. It now remains to know
your pleasure. Let it be as you wish.’ She said the same
and, ‘God grant blessing and peace! His idea is very
good.’ My chicha? herself and Badi‘u-l-jamal Begam and
Aq Begam, both of whom were paternal aunts of his Majesty,
were conducted into the hall. Having raised an estrade?
and spread carpets and chosen a propitious hour, Maham’s
nanacha made both sultans bow the knee‘ in order to exalt
them to the rank of sons-in-law.

Meantime his Majesty’s disorder of the bowels increased.
The Emperor Humayun broke down again when he saw
his father’s condition worsen, and called the doctors, and
said to them: ‘ Think it well over and find some remedy.’
(9a) Having consulted together, they said: ‘Small is our

1 tabassum kundn.

2 This Turki word presents great difficulty.

Vambéry has jicha, Kirghiz, mother, and chicha, aunt (inferentially
maternal); Shaw, chicha, Qazzaq, mother. P. de Courteille, Dict.,
chicha, an elder sister. The word has in Samarqand the meaning
‘maternal aunt.’ .

It occurs again in the text (23a), and is used for Gul-badan’s sisters,
the brides of this page (19a) ; ; so that it may be right (spite of the
singular number) to read ‘my elder sisters themselves —i.e. ., the
brides. But it might be ‘my mother.’

The word occurs at least once in the Memoirs. (Ilm., 446 ; Ers., 387.)
It is preceded by one which Ilminsky writes yanka, and Erskine Bikeh
(Bega). The letters of both words might be identical and the points
only decisive. Shaw says yangd is an elder brother’s wife; Vambéry,
belle-scur, Schwagerin ; and Erskine (208 n. .), bridesmaid, by which,
I believe, is meant one who leads the bride to the bridegroom—an
exactly appropriate use here, since Habiba yanga brings her daughter
Ma‘sima to marry Babar. (N.B.—Shaw writes y yanga and chicha,
where Vambéry and others have a final ‘round hd.’)

But if the chicha of Mems., 387, is to be read ‘elder sister,’ Babar
can apply it only to Khanzada Begam (elsewhere called by him aulugh
agachi (Ilm., 116.); and this would, I believe, make the reading of
Bikeh (Bega) difficult, since Khanzada could not be called anything less
than Khanam. The same objection would apply to the reading of chicha
as mother or as maternal aunt. This inclines one to read yanka, and not
bikeh, at Mems., 887; and the Zainab of the sentence may be grand-
’ daughter (nabira), through the female line, of the belle-swur, or brides-
maid, of Khanzada Begam. But nothing is clear as to the relationship.

luck, for our remedies are of no avail. We hope that God, the
most Holy, will soon give one from His invisible treasures.’

When they felt his Majesty’s pulse, they came to the
opinion that there were symptoms of the same poison as
that given him by Sultan Ibrahim’s mother. It was in
this way: that ill-fated demon (the mother) gave a tola of
poison to one of her maids, and said: ‘ Take this and give
it to Ahmad the taster and tell him to put it in some way
or other into the special dishes prepared for the Emperor.’
And she promised him large rewards. The ill-fated demon
did this although his Majesty used to call her “mother,”
and had assigned her place and lands with every favour,
and had been kindly pleased to say: ‘ Consider me as in
the place of Sultan Ibrahim.’! But as ignorance prevails
amongst those people, she did not regard his kindnesses.
The (fitting) hemistich is well known :

‘Everything reverts to its original type,
(Whether pure gold, or silver, or tin).’

To cut short the story: the cook (Heaven having made
him blind and deaf,) spread the poison which had been
brought and given to him, on the Emperor’s bread only,
and so little was eaten. But the symptoms of this illness
were like that one’s, seeing that day by day he lost
strength and became more and more emaciated. (19b) Every
day the disorder increased and his blessed countenance
changed.

Next day® he called his chiefs together and spoke after
this wise: ‘For years it has been in my heart to make over
my throne to Humayun Mirza and to retire to the Gold-
scattering Gurden. By the Divine grace I have obtained
all things but the fulfilment of this wish in health of body.
Now, when illness has laid me low, I charge you all to
acknowledge Humayun in my stead. Fail not in loyalty

to him. Be of one heart and one mind with him. I hope
to God that Humayun also will bear himself well towards
men.

‘Moreover, Humayun, I commit to God’s keeping you
and your brothers and all my kinsfolk and your people and
my people; and all of these I confide to you.’

At these words hearers and onlookers wept and lamented.
His own blessed eyes also filled with tears. .

When his family and the people within the haram heard
of these occurrences, they were stupefied and overwhelmed,
and cried and lamented.

Three days later he passed from this transitory world to
the eternal home. The death took place on Monday,
December 26th, 1530 (Jumada I. 5th, 937H.). (20a)

They brought out our paternal aunt’ and our mothers?
on the pretence that the doctors were coming to look. All
rose. They took all the begams and my mothers to the
’ Great House.*

Black fell the day for children and kinsfolk and all.
They bewailed and lamented; voices were uplifted in
weeping; there was utter dejection. Each passed that ill-
fated day in a hidden corner.

The death was kept concealed. After a time Araish
Khan,—he was an amir of Hind,—said: ‘It is not well
to keep the death secret, because when such misfortunes
befall kings in Hindistan, it is the custom of the bazar
people to rob and steal; God forbid that the Mughals
not knowing, they should come and loot the houses and
dwelling-places. It would be best to dress someone in red,
and to set him on an elephant, and to let him proclaim that
the Emperor Babar has become a dervish and has given
his throne to the Emperor Humayun.’ This his Majesty
Humayun ordered to be done. People were at once re-
assured by the proclamation, and all offered prayers for

his welfare. On Friday, December 29th, 1580 (Jumada I.
9th, 987H.), the Emperor Humayin mounted the throne,
and everyone said: ‘May all the world be blessed under
his rule.’ (20b) .

After that he came to visit his mothers and sisters and
his own people, and he made inquiry after their health
and offered sympathy, and spoke with kindness and com-
miseration. He was pleased to order: ‘ Let each keep the
office, and service, and lands, and residence which he -has
had, and let him serve in the old way.’

On the same day Hindal Mirza, having come from Kabul,
paid his homage to the Emperor, who received him with .
kindness, and was very happy, and bestowed on him many.
_ things from the treasures left by their father.

After my royal father’s death, there were the good works
and consecrated days of the first assembly! at his tomb.”
His Majesty named Muhammad ‘Ali ‘asas* its guardian,
and ordered the appointment of sixty good reciters of the
whole Quran and readers with good voices, so that the
congregational prayers might be said five times daily and -
the whole Quran recited, and prayer offered for the soul of
the royal dweller in Paradise (Firdaus-makdnz). (21a) The
whole of Sikri—now known as Fathpur—together with five
laks charged on Bayana, was given as an endowment to the

1 ma‘rka. Raverty (Afghan Dict..) gives as the first meaning of
this word ‘a party of ambassadors, or persons sent to make peace
between two tribes’; and, secondly, as ‘the business of making peace,
or an arrangement between two tribes.’ Lane and other writers
render it ‘battle-field’ and ‘battle,’ etc. Steingass adds ‘hubbub,
turmoil’ (modern colloquial). Gul-badan uses it for the common
social assemblies she names, and here for the gathering of relations
at a tomb.

2 Babar’s body was laid first in the Ram or Aram Bagh (Garden
of Rest), on the opposite side of the river from the present Taj-mahdall.
Later it was taken to Kabul.’ Mr. Erskine (B. & M., I. 517 et seq..)
quotes a charming passage from Burns’ ‘ Travels in Bokhara’ (IT. 121
et seq.), which describes Babar’s self-chosen resting-place. He follows
this by an eloquent estimate of Babar’s character which makes clear
his regret in bidding farewell to the great and vivid personality he
has so admirably set before his readers.

tomb, for the support of the men of learning (‘ulamd) and
the reciters who were attached to it.

My lady made an allowance of food twice daily: in the
morning an ox and two sheep and five goats, and at after-———
‘noon prayer-time five goats. She gave this from her own _
estate during the two and a half years that she remained in
the prison of this world.

During my lady’s life I used to see his Majesty in her
residence. When she fell into bad health, she said to me:
‘It will be very hard that when I am gone, the Emperor
Babar’s daughters should see their brother in Bibi Gul-
barg’s' house. Just as though her words were in the
royal heart and mind, his Majesty used always, so long as
he was in Hindistan, to come to our house. He used to
visit us and showed us kindness and affection and favour
without stint. He used to come to the house of this
insignificant one, and there would come Masuma Sultan
Begam, and Gul-rang Begam, and Gul-chihra Began,’ etc.
—all the married ladies—and pay their duty to him. (210)

In short, after the death of my royal father and my
lady, his Majesty, in the fulness of his affection, showed .
this broken one such favour, and spoke with such boundless
compassion to this helpless one, that she did not know she
was orphaned and headless.°

During the ten* years after the death of his Majesty

Hind, the people dwelt in repose and safety, and obedience
and loyalty.® 7

makdani, Biban! and Bayazid advanced from the direction of
Gaur. On the news of this, his Majesty at once left Agra
and moved to meet them. He defeated them, and then
went to Chanada (Chunar),? took it, and thence returned to
Agra.

My lady, who was Maham Begam, had a great longing
and desire to see a son of Humayiin. Wherever there was
a good-looking and nice girl, she used to bring her
into his service. Maywa-jan, a daughter of Khadang
(? Khazang), the chamberlain (yasawal),? was in my employ.
One day (after) the death of his Majesty Firdaus-makani,!
my lady said: ‘ Humayin, Maywa-jan is not bad. Why
do you not take her into your service?’ So, at her word,
Humayin married and took her that very night. (22a)

Three days later Bega Begam® came from Kabul. She
became in the family way. In due time® she had a
daughter, whom they named “Agiqa. Maywa-jan said to
Lady (Aka) Maham Begam, ‘I am in the family way, too.’
Then my lady got ready two sets of weapons, and said:
‘Whichever of you bears a son, I will give him good
arms.’ Then she packed up the arms, and got ready
gold and silver walnuts. She procured also the (special)
arms of a Mughal commander, and was very happy, and

5 Bega had had one son, Al-aman. She is known in the later
histories as Haji Begam, but she made her pilgrimage in 972H.. She
was captured at Chausa in 1539 (946H.) by Shir Shah; and most
writers give her at this date the brevet titie of Haji. It is probable
that Bega was not her personal name. It is the title of a lady of rank,
and answers to beg.

kept saying: ‘Perhaps one of them will have a son.’ She

kept watch till Bega Begam’s‘Aqiqa was born. Then she

kept an eye on Maywa-jan. Ten months went by. The
eleventh also passed. Maywa-jan said: ‘My maternal aunt————
was in Mirza Ulugh Beg’s' haram. She had a son in the
twelfth month; perhaps I am like her.’ So they sewed

tents and filled pillows.2 But in the end everyone knew

she was a fraud. .

His Majesty who had gone towards Chanada (Chunar),
returned safe and sound.

My lady who was Maham Begam, gave a great feast.
(22b) They lit up the bazars.? Before that time people used
to illuminate the bazars (only). Then she gave orders to
the better class and to the soldiers also to decorate their
places and make their quarters beautiful, and after this
illumination became general in India.

... a jewelled throne,‘ ascended by four steps, and above
it gold-embroidered hangings, and laid on it a cushion and
pillows embroidered in gold.

The covering of the pavilions and of the large audience
tent was, inside, European brocade, and outside, Portu-
guese cloth. The tent-poles were gilded; that was very
ornamental. ;

(My lady) had prepared a tent-lining and a kannat®
and sar-i-kannat of Gujrati cloth-of-gold, and a ewer for
rose-water, and candlesticks, and drinking-vessels, and rose-
water sprinklers,—all of jewelled gold.

With all her stores of plenishing, she made an excellent
and splendid feast.

3 IT am very doubtful as to the meaning of the following paragraph.
It can hardly be true that India waited for Maham to instruct it in the
art of illumination or decoration. I have conjecturally read that,
whereas formerly only bdzdrs were made to look festive, she had other
houses adorned.

feast. There are here and at p. 123 ff. many difficult words in it.

She gave special robes of honour to 7,000 persons. The
festivities lasted several days.!

At this time came news that Muhammad-zaman Mirza?
had killed the father of Haji Muhammad Khan kiki,
and was meditating rebellion. (23a) His Majesty sent to
summon them‘ to the presence, and having laid hands
on them, imprisoned them in Bayana, in charge of
Uncle Yadgar. Uncle Yadgar’s men sided with Muhammad-
zaman Mirza, and let him escape (15383—940H.). At this
time it was ordered that Sultan Muhammad Mirza> and
Nai® (Wali) Khub Sultan Mirza should both be blinded.

1 The feast here credited to Maham Begam may be that of the first
anniversary of Humayiin’s accession. Of this Gul-badan gives an
account, minus such details as are set down here, at 24a et seq..

At the ‘ accession feast,’ held December 19th, 1531, and thus not quite
a year after the accession, it is said by Nizimu-d-din Ahmad that
12,000 robes were bestowed, 2,000 of these being ‘ special.’ For details
as to khil‘at, cf. Memoirs, 274 n..

Lists are dull reading, unless each item calls up an image. It is
easy to add splendour and beauty to Gul-badan’s few poor words by
looking at actual things of the kinds she names, as may be done in the
Oriental Section of the South Kensington Museum. The links between
Persia and India in her day and earlier and later were many and close.
Many Persians born and bred in Persia or by descent formed part of the
Mughal court. Persian art and manufacture were at their highest
development, experts say, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.
The uncritical eye doubts if the products of those centuries, as exhibited
in the examples England possesses, can be excelled for splendour and
satisfying charm. With such things the personages of our begam’s
book surrounded themselves.

with his sons, Ulugh Mirza and Shah Mirza, made their
escape a few days later.

There was perpetual disturbance from these people
during the years we were in Hind. —_

When his Majesty returned from the campaign against

Biban and Bayazid, he was in Agra! for about a year.
He said to my lady: ‘I am sad at heart in these days.
If you approved, I would go with you to Gualiar.”* Her
Highness my lady, and my mother (d@am),? and my sisters
Ma'suma‘ Sultan Begam, whom we used to call Elder
sister Moon, and Gul-rang Begam, whom we used to call
Elder sister Rose,—we all were in Gualiar in attendance on
the beneficent ladies.®

As Gul-chihra Begam was in Oude, and her husband,
Tukhta-bigha Sultan, went to the mercy of God, her
attendants wrote to his Majesty from Oude and said:
‘Tukhta-bigha Sultan is dead. (23b) What is the order
about the begam?’ His Majesty said to Mir Zaycha:’ ‘Go
and bring the begam to Agra. We also are going there.’

At this time her Highness my lady said: ‘If you
approve, I will send for Bega Begam and ‘Aqiga, so that -
they also may see Gualiar.’ She despatched Naukar® and :
Khwaja Kabir, who brought them from Agra.

its date as Sha’ban 939H. (February, 1533).

as ‘ Ma desirée,’ but considered with other words in this text after which
the enclitic am (my) is incorrectly written, it seems that prosaic ‘my

desire, is the wording on 25b (No. 48 of the guest-list), djam walida-

They let two months slip by in one another’s company
in Gualiar, and then set out for Agra, which they reached
in February, 1534 (Sha ban, 940 H.).?

In April (Shawwal) my lady was attacked by a disorder
of the bowels. On the 27th of the same month (13th
Shawwal) she passed from this transitory life to the
eternal home.

The stamp of orphanhood was set anew on my royal
father’s children, and especially on me, for whom she
herself had cared. I felt lonely and helpless and in great
affliction. Day and night I wept and mourned and grieved.
His Majesty came several times to comfort me, and
showed me sympathy and kindness. I was two years old
when her Highness my lady took me into her own house
and cared for me, and I was ten when she departed from
this life. (24a) I remained one year more in her house.”
When I was eleven, and his Majesty went to Dholpur, I

1 This date cannot be right. The following are approximately correct
for this time: Visit to Gualiar undertaken, Sha‘ban, 939H. (February,
1588). Return to Agra and Maham’s illness, Shawwail (April). Death
of Maham, 13th Shawwal (May 8, 1533). Forty days of mourning
carries on the time to late in Zi’l-qa‘da (June). Start for Dihli, begin-
ning of Zw’l-hijja,—after June24. The building of Dinpana was begun
Muharram, 940H. (July, 1533).

2 Maham had also adopted Hindal. Babar details the circum-
stances, but the abbreviation, as it seems, of the Persian text, has led
to an error. (Mems., 250.) Those children of Babar who died young,
were not born in ‘this year’ (925H.), as will be seen in the fuller
rendering of Ilminsky, 281, and of P. de C., II. 44: ‘ Aprés Humayin
(b. 918H.) j’eus encore plusieurs enfants, nés de la méme mére que
lui, mais qui ne vécurent pas.’

We know from Gul-badan that these were Barbil, Mihr-jahan, and
Ishan-daulat.

‘Hindal n’était pas encore venu dans le monde. Comme j’étais
dans ces parages [Kehraj, in Mandesh, and on his way to India], il
m’arriva une lettre de Maham, dans laquelle elle me disait, ‘‘ Sera-ce
un fils ou une fille? Prononcez vous-méme sur la part que me réserve
la fortune ; 4 moi de mettre l’enfant dans le monde [Erskine, ‘I will
regard the child as mine’] et de Vélever.”’ Le vendredi, 26 du mois,

birth], et je lui écrivis 4 ce sujet une lettre qui lui fut portée 4 Kabul
par Yiisuf ‘Ali rikab-dar [courier] quoique Hindal ne ftit pas encore né.’

A passage now follows which, as is noted by P. de C., is neither in
the Persian version of the Memoirs nor in the English translation :

went to Gualiar and began to build.”

At the end of the mourning for my lady, his Majesty
went to Dihli? and began to build the fort of Din-pand.t

He then returned to Agra. ~

Dearest lady® (Khanzada Begam) said to his Majesty :

Elles prennent deux morceaux de papier; sur l’un elles écrivent, ‘Ali
ou Hasan, sur l’autre Fatima; puis elles les placent dans deux boules
de limon qu’elles mettent dans une coupe d’eau. Celles des deux qui
s’ouvre la premiére, leur sert 4 prognostiquer Vavenir ; si elle ren-
ferme le nom d’un garcon, il y aura un garcon; si c’est celui d’une
fille, il y aura une fille, disent-elles. On employa cette méthode; ce
fut un enfant male qui en sortit. En recevant cette bonne nouvelle,
j’écrivis aussitét pour en faire part 4 ma mére [sic]. Quelques jours
plus tard, effectivement Dieu me donna un garcon. Trois jours aprés
sa naissance et avant de l’annoncer, on enleva enfant, bon gré, mal
gré, 4 sa mére et on l’apporta chez moi ot on le garda. Lorsque j’en
donnai avis 4 ma mére [s‘c], celle-ci apprenant qu’elle avait obtenu
lobjet de ses voeux, donna au jeune prince le nom de Hindal, qui était
pour nous de bon augure. Par cet. arrangement cet enfant fit pour
moi [? nous] & la fois un frére cadet (for Humaytin) et un fils (for
Maham and himself).

The words hazrat wdlida cannot mean the mother of Babar She
had been dead some fourteen years. They may be equivalent to
Sultan-walida—t.e., the mother of the heir-apparent. Certainly it
was Maham who adopted Hindal. This initial misconception as to
the identity of Hazrat walida runs through the whole translation of
this most interesting passage. According to Gul-badan, Fariiq (born
in 9382H.) was Maham’s son. Babar names the birth. (Mems., 343.)

Majesty replied: ‘ B’ismu-l-lah.’ When Mirza Hindal was
married, my lady (Maham) was living, but there was delay
in arranging the feast. (Khanzada Begam) said: ‘ The
things for the Mystic Feast are also ready. Let us first
celebrate this, and afterwards Mirza Hindal’s.’ His Majesty
said: ‘ Let whatever my royal aunt wishes be done.’ She
replied: ‘May God bless it and make it good.’

“DESCRIPTION oF THE House oF FEASTING WHICH WAS SET
UP ON THE River’s Bank, AND WHICH WAS CALLED THE
Mystic! Hovse:

First there was a large octagonal room with an octa-—
gonal tank in the centre, and again, in the middle of the
reservoir, an octagonal platform on which were spread
Persian (wildyatt) carpets. (24) Young men and pretty
girls and elegant women and musicians and sweet-voiced
reciters were ordered to sit in the tank.’

The jewelled throne which my lady had given for the
feast was placed in the fore-court of the house, and a gold-
embroidered divan® was laid in front of it, (on which) his
Majesty and dearest lady sat together.

On her right sat her paternal aunts, the daughters of
Sultan Abii-sa‘id Mirza :

1.4 Fakhr-jahan Begam.
2. Badi‘u-l-jamal Begam.
8. Aq> Begam.

4, Sultan Bakht Begam.

1 Tilism; Greek, ré\eoua, talisman. Perhaps an epithet drifted
from astrological phraseology. This feast commemorated the acces-
sion of Humayin. Cf. Humdyiin-nama, trs. Sada-stkh La’l (B.M.
Add. 30,774, p. 76.): ‘talismanic palace,’ which may be the building
named by Gul-badan. Cf. ‘ samite, mystic,’ of Tennyson. Khwand-
amir speaks at length of this feast in his Humdyiin-ndma, and calls
the building in which it was held ‘imdrat-t-filism.

Upon another cushion sat our paternal aunts, the sisters
of his Majesty, Firdaus-makani :

7. Shahr-bani Begam.
8. Yadgar Sultan Begam.

(N.B.— Other guests of the right follow).

9. ‘Ayisha Sultan Begam, daughter of Sultan Husain
Mirza.

10. Ulugh Begam, daughter of Zainab Sultan Begam, a
paternal aunt of his Majesty.

11. ‘Ayisha Sultan Begam. .

12. Sultani Begam, daughter of Sultan Ahmad Mirza,

paternal (grand-)uncle of his Majesty.

14. Maham Begam.?

15. Begi Begam, daughter of Ulugh Beg Mirza Kabuli,
paternal (grand-)uncle of his Majesty.

16. Khanzada Begam, daughter of Sultan Mas‘id Mirza;
on her mother’s side, grand-daughter of Payanda Muham-
mad Sultan Begam, paternal (grand-)aunt of his Majesty.

17. Shah Khanam, daughter of Badi’u-l-jamal Begam
(No. 2.).

18. Khanam Begam, daughter of Aq Begam (No. 3.).

19. Zainab Sultan Khanam, daughter of Sultan Mahmid
Khan, eldest maternal (grand-)uncle of his Majesty.

20. Muhibb Sultan Khanam, daughter of Sultan Ahmad
Khan,— known as Ilacha Khan, the younger maternal uncle
of the elder? Emperor (Babar).

1 The words used of Sultani do not grammatically apply to ‘Ayisha,
but I believe she is also a daughter of Sultan Ahmad Mirza and is
Babar’s first wife, who left him under the influence of an elder sister,
perhaps Saliga Sultan (Aq Begam). Saliqa married a son of Sultan
Mahmiid Mirza, and may have acted under the evil impulses of the
family quarrels which did so much to embitter, if also to stimulate,
Babar’s early ambitions.

had great friendship for one another (? Shad and Mihr-

adorned by varied accomplishments, such as the making
of thumb-rings* and arrows, playing polo, and shooting

1 Probably the daughter of Sultan Mahmiid Mirza and mother of
Shad Begam (No. 28.) by a son, Haidar, of Sultan Husain Mirza.

2 Text zih-girt tarashi, which might be experimentally rendered
carving thumb-rings, a gentle art of the day. But if wa be inserted,
each word would represent a separate accomplishment of the well-bred
in knightly arts. These would be congenial to a lady who played polo
(chaugdn). Cf. Babar’s account of Haidar’s accomplishments (Ilmin-
sky, 14, Mems., 18, P. de C., 22.), and Haidar’s own recital in his
prologue to the Tarikh-t-rashidi.

I suggest to take tarashi (a word not used by Babar or Haidar) as
equivalent to the fletchery (auq), or the ‘ making arrow-heads’ (paikan),
of Babar.

Another possible reading has been suggested to me by Mr. Beveridge
—(a)z hikirt tarashi, ‘by cutting arrows.’ Hikri is a Hindi name for
cultivated reeds grown on low marshy grounds. (Wilson’s Glossary,
3.v., and Platt’s Hindustani Dict..) There is nothing improbable in
Gul-badan’s use of a Hindi word. Arrows were fashioned from these
reeds and men-at-arms practised the art. Gujrat reeds were exported
for arrows to Persia. The omission of the alif of az is not infrequent
in the MS..

A few words on the zth-gir find fit insertion here. It is a thumb-
ring worn on the right hand as a protection against the fret of the
bow-string both in drawing and release. Persians, like the Japanese and
Mongols and Chinese, drew with the thumb. The zih-gir is of eccentric

with the bow and arrow. They also played many musical
instruments.

30. Gul Begam.

31. Fauq Begam.

32. Khan (? Jan) Begam.

33. Afroz-bani Begam.

34. Agha Begam.

35. Firoza Begam.

86. Barlas Begam.

There were other begams, very many, adding up
altogether to ninety-six stipendiaries. There were also
some others.

After the Mystic Feast (988 H.) came Mirza Hindal’s
wedding-feast (Jauhar, 944 H.). Some of the begams
already named went away, and (of those) some had sat at
the right hand in that assembly (i.e., the Mystic Feast).?

Of our begams :

87. Agha (Agha,—passim, dgha), Sultan aghacha, mother
of Yadgar Sultan Begam.

88. Atun mama.

39. Salima.

40. Sakina.

41. Bibi Habiba.

thickness and unequal width, elongating on one side into a tongue.
This elongation lies along the inner side of the thumb, and points
towards the thumb-tip. In drawing, the thumb crooks round the
string which pulls against the zih-gir. The arrow is released by
straightening the thumb, and the string then flies over the hard surface
of the ring. The zth-gir is of jade, crystal, ivory, brass, gold, etc.. Some
are chased and carved, and some are jewelled. In December, 1898, a
remarkable one was offered for sale at an auction in Edinburgh of
Lord Dalhousie’s collections and the jewels of his daughter, Lady
8. G. Brown (Connemara). It is cut from a single emerald, and
inscribed: ‘ Jihat zihgir shah-t-shahan Nadir sihib-qiran bar taskhir-
t-hind az jawéhar-khana intikhab shud’ (‘ Selected for a thumb-ring
for the king of kings and lord of happy conjunction Nadir, from the
jewel-room on the conquest of Hind’).

An interesting account of Persian archery is included in the ‘ Book
of Archery,’ G. Agar Hansard (Lond., 1840.). It, however, calls the
ath-gir, safn. Safn is the rough skin of a fish or lizard which is
used to smooth the arrow-shafts. (Cf. Lane’s Ar. Dict..)

guests.

There are no repetitions of names, although the list seems to give the

983H., and as being of Babar’s household. They (Nos. 57 and 58) are

This was the fashion of the Mystic House: (there was)
a large octagonal room in which they gave the feast, over
against this a small room, also octagonal. In both every
sort of profusion and splendour appeared. In the large
octagonal hall was set the jewelled throne, and above and °
below it were spread out hangings (adsaqahdt) embroidered
with gold, and wonderful strings of pearls (shadhtha) hung,
each 14 yards (gaz) in length. At the end of each string
(larv) were two glass globes. There had been made and
hung some thirty or forty strings.

In the small room, in an alcove, were set a gilded bed-
stead and pdn-dishes,! and water-vessels and jewelled
drinking-vessels, and utensils of pure gold and silver.

learned to eat pan.

Facing west (was) the audience hall ; facing east, the
garden; on the third side and facing south, the large
octagon ; and on the side facing north, the small one. In
these three houses were three upper rooms. One they
named the House of Dominion, and in it were nine military
appurtenances, such as a jewelled scimitar and gilded
armour, a broad dagger and a curved dagger, and a quiver,
all gilt, and a gold-embroidered overmantle.? (27a)

In the second room, called the House of Good Fortune,
an oratory had been arranged, and books placed, and
gilded pen-cases,® and splendid portfolios,‘ and entertaining
picture-books written in beautiful character.°

In the third room, which they called the House of
Pleasure, were set out a gilded bedstead and a coffer of
sandal-wood, and all imaginable pillows. Then in front
were spread specially choice coverlets,® and before these
table-cloths, all of gold brocade. Various fruits and
beverages had been got ready, and everything for merri-
ment and comfort and pleasure.

On the feast-day of the Mystic House, his Majesty
ordered all the mirzas and begams to bring gifts,’ and
everyone did so. He said: ‘ Divide the gifts into three
heaps.’ They made three trays of ashrafts and six of
shahrukhis. One of ashrafis and two of shahrukhis he

armour) may be taken in the sense given to it in the Ain (Bloch-
mann, 109.), and include four weapons, which makes the total the mystic
nine. Cf. Ain, l.c., and plates. (N.B.—The numbering of the weapons
[Z.c. p. 110.] does not agree with that of the plates. Plate X. should be
consulted.)

3 galam-dan. Several such are to be seen at the 8. K. M. They
are boxes damascened or painted with pictures, about 10 inches by
3 inches, and contain writing implements. ‘Gilded’ does not seem an
appropriate epithet. Perhaps the dictionaries define imperfectly.

having flaps might be called portfolios.

gave to Hindu Beg and said: ‘This is the share of
Dominion; give it to the mirzais and chiefs and vazirs and
soldiers.’ (27))

He gave in the same way to Mulla Muhammad Farghari —__
(Parghali) and said: ‘ This is the share of Good Fortune. -
Give it to those who are eminent and respectable, and to
theologians and religious men, to ascetics and graybeards,
and dervishes and devotees, and the poor and the needy.’

Concerning one tray of ashrafts and two of shahrukhis he
said: ‘ This is the portion of Pleasure. Thisismine. Bring
it forward.’ They did so. He said: ‘ What need is there
to count?’ First he himself vouchsafed his blessed hand
and said: ‘ Let them take to the begams on one small tray
ashrafis and on another shahrukhis. Let each person take
her hands full.’ What was left, that is two trays of shah-
rukhts,—which may have been 10,000,—and all the ashrafts,
—about 2,000—he gave in largesse, and scattered! first be-
fore the walt ’u-n-ni' matan (beneficent seniors), and then to
those present at the entertainment. No one received less
than 100 or 150, and those in the tank especially received
very much. (28a) His Majesty was pleased to say: ‘Dearest
lady! if you approved, they might put water in the tank.’
She replied: ‘ Very good,’ and went herself and sat at the
top of the steps. People were taking no notice, when all
at once (?) the tap was turned and water came. (28a) The
young people got very much excited. His Majesty said :
‘There is no harm; each of you will eat a pellet of anise?
and a bit of comfit®? and come out of there.’ Upon this,
everyone who would eat the comfit came out quickly. The
water was as high as their ankles. To end the story,
everyone ate the comfit and all came out.

Then the viands of the feast were set forth, and robes of

honour were put on,' and gifts bestowed, and head-to-foot
dresses given to the comfit-eaters and others.

On the margin of the tank was a room (taldr)* fitted
with tale windows, and young people sat in the room and
players made music. Also a woman’s bazar® had been
arranged, and boats had been decorated. In one boat was
made (?) the semblance of six people (kasi) and six alcoves
(kanj); in (another) an upper room, and below it a garden _
with amaranthus and cockscombs and larkspurs* and
tulips. In one place there were eight boats, so that
there were eight pieces.®

In short, everyone was astonished and amazed who
beheld what gift of contrivance the great God had bestowe
on the blessed mind of his Majesty. (28b) -

In this passage Gul-badan twice uses the expression sar u-pdi. Per-
haps one might say that the ‘young people’ were given new clothes
from head to foot, and so shake off the fetters of the rigid khi‘lat, sar-
u-pdi, and ‘honorary dresses.’

2 The dictionaries I have seen, explain t(lir as a saloon built of wood
and supported on four columns, and this is appropriate here. Le
Strange and Haggard (Vazir of Lonkuran) say, ‘ Alcove or chamber in
which a ruler sits to give public audience and hear suitors.’ It is raised
above the level of the (e.g.) courtyard, so that petitioners are below the
hakim. Approaching this meaning is the ‘throne’ of the dictionaries.

as though she were her child. Sultanam was two years
old when Khanzada Begam took charge of her. She
(Khanzada) loved her very much, and thought of her as a
brother’s child of her own. She made a most entertaining
and splendid feast.

embroidered cushions and head-to-foot dresses for a prince,
with collar and bordering of gold embroidery, and bath-

worn over the armour.

For Sultanam Begam: nine jackets (nim-tana)* with
garniture of jewelled balls,> one of ruby, one of cornelian,

1M. Quatremére uses this word twice with perhaps two meanings.
(Notices et Extraits, XIV. 324, 325 and 406-8.) At p. 408 he translates
it kiosques, and it seems to be a building. At pp. 324 and 406 he
leaves it untranslated. (Here it may have the sense given by
Gul-badan.) It is named amongst items prepared for ambassadors at
a post-house. These are: ‘kat, tréne ; bastar, estrade;... kushka;
jinltk ; sandali, siége,’ etc. Gul-badan might intend to name a canopy
or screen for a sleeping-place in a large room or a movable kiosk with
sleeping comforts.

2 Cf. 22b.

3 A word follows tent which I cannot make out. It resembles
j-(h,ch)-l-gh (no vowels).

4 nim-tana, t.e., demi-corps. Like many of Gul-badan’s words, this
is marked by Steingass as ‘modern colloquial.’ Apropos of this,
Dr. Fritz Rosen says in the preface of his Modern Persian Colloquial
Grammar, that the Persian of Iran differs ‘in every respect’ from the
Persian of India. The Persian of Gul-badan allows one to feel at home
with the vazir of Lonkuran, and with Dr. Rosen’s own book. Per-
haps the difference he indicates is between the literary and colloquial.
Gul-badan’s Persian, however, is presumably that of contemporary
Irén, and her teachers were probably Persian born. Dr. Rosen’s
remark appears to require some restriction.

5 tukma (dar), usually translated buttons ; but the button is so asso-
ciated with the button-hole as to suggest a fastening. A dressmaker
might say ‘ball-trimming.’ Globular buttons were and are placed
round the neck and hem of a boddice. The vazir of Lonkurain
ordered a jacket with garniture of twenty-four gold buttons, smaller
than a hen’s and larger than a pigeon’s. Vests trimmed with ‘ buttons’
(Mems.) are repeatedly named by Babar as gifts.

Again: of necklaces, nine; and one embroidered collar

(tukma-dar), and one pair of ruby earrings and another of
pearls, three fans,” and one royal umbrella.

One dirakht®? and two khutb? and other furniture and
effects, and household goods and chattels and workshops* of
all sorts. (29a) Khanzada Begam gave everything she had
collected, and she arranged a feast such as had not been
made for any other child of my royal father. She planned
it all and carried it all out.

What my royal father’s brother-in-law’ (Mahdi Khwaja)
gave to the mirza was a set of nine tipiichaq horses, with
jewelled and gold-embroidered saddles and bridles; and

1 char gartiji; a suggested rendering only. Johnson gives karti
(qartt) as a short boddice reaching to the hips, and the gar recurs in
other words, having the sense of a body garment; e¢.g., gartaq, a
short-sleeved jacket; garza, a woman’s vest.

2 pankha.

3 T find no help as to these words in the dictionaries. My only
suggestion as to their possible meaning is too slightly based to be of
value. Itis this: In the South Kensington Museum, Oriental Section,
I have seen tall lamp-stands so shaped that they recall the Qugd pillar
outside Dihli. That such stands would be a part of good household
furnishing the South Kensington Museum allows us to suppose. We
have our ‘tall lamps,’ our ‘ pillar lamps,’ and also our ‘branched candle-
sticks,’ which may be a term parallel to dirakht, a tree.

4 kar-khanaha. These may be the kitchen and its plenishing; the
goldsmith’s, with his tools, furnaces, and appliances; the perfumer’s,
ete.. Cf. Ain, Blochmann, and Tar. Rash., E. & R., 470.

5 ghulamdn, which I have rendered slaves, because they were a gift.
But I know no warrant for such servitude as is thus implied.

6 yazna, which is explained by Vambéry and Steingass as ‘ husband
of the king’s sister.’ Nizamu-d-din Ahmad styles Mahdi Khwaja
damdd, which Meninsky and Steingass explain as ‘husband of the
king’s sister’ and ‘son-in-law.’ I do not find yazna rendered son-in-
law by any of the dictionaries. To read yazna ‘ brother-in-law of the
king’ agrees with the detailed statement of Mahdi’s relation to Babar
made by Bayazid biyat. Cf. Appendix, s.n. Khanzada.

gold and silver vessels, and two other sets of nine horses,
baggage animals, with velvet saddles and bridles; and
brocade and Portuguese cloth, and Tirki and Habshi and
Hindi slaves,—in all, three sets of nine; and three head of_
elephants.

In his Majesty’s leisure after the feast came news that
the vazir of Sultan Bahadur, Khurasin Khan by name,
had attacked Bayana. His Majesty despatched Mirza
“Askari, with several amirs, Mir Faqr-ali Beg and Mir
Tardi Beg, etc.. These went to Bayana and fought and
defeated Khurasin Khan. (29) The Emperor set out
for Gujrat shortly afterwards, in prosperity and safety. It
was on the 15th of the revered Rajab 941H.? that he quite
decided to go himself to Gujrat. He set up his advance
camp in the Gold-scattering Garden, and there spent a
month while the forces were gathering in.

On court days, which were Sundays and Tuesdays, he
used to go to the other side of the river. During his stay
in the garden, djam (Dil-dar Begam) and my sisters and the
ladies (haramdn) were often in his company. Of all the
tents, Ma'suma Sultan Begam’s was at the top of the row.
Next came Gul-rang Begam’s, and djam’s was in the same
place. Then the tent of my mother,® Gul-barg Begam and
of Bega Begam*‘ and the others.

They set up the offices (kar-khanaha) and got them into

1 Mirza Muqim, Khurasan Khan.

2 January 29th, 1535. Abiu’l-fazl gives Jumada I., 941H. (Novem-
ber, 1534) as the time for collecting the troops. Perhaps the begam’s
date is that of departure, a day liable to postponement when Humayin
was in pleasant quarters.

3 It may be that the copyist has transferred the words ‘my mother’
from a quite usual place,—preceding or following the djam of the
previous sentence. They are inappropriate to Gul-barg Begam; at
least, I have never seen them used to describe a brother’s wife, and such
I believe this Gul-barg tobe. We know of a ‘ Bibi Gul-barg,’ mentioned
somewhat condescendingly (21a) by Maham Begam ; I incline to take
Gul-barg there and here as Khalifa’s daughter, and the former wife of
Mir Shah Husain Arghiin. Cf. Appendix, s.n. Gul-barg.

4 This is, I think, Humayin’s wife and the mother of ‘Aqiqa. The
object of Gul-badan’s enumeration of the tents seems to be desire to
show that Babar’s daughters and widow had places of honour higher
than Humayin’s family.

order. When they had put up the pavilions (khaima) and
tents (khar-gah) and the audience tent (bar-gah), the Emperor
came to see the camp and the splendid set-out, and visited
the begams and his sisters. As he had dismounted some-
what near Ma‘suma Sultan Begam’s (tent), he honoured
her with a visit. All of us, the begams and my sisters,
were in his society. (302) When he went to any begam’s or
sister’s quarters, all the begams and all his sisters used to
go with him. Next day he came to the tent! of this lowly
person, and the entertainment lasted till the third watch?
of the night. Many begams were there, and his sisters,
and ladies of rank (begaha) and of position (aghaha), and
other ladies (dghdchaha), and musicians and reciters.
After the third watch his Majesty was pleased to command
repose. His sisters and the begams made resting-places
(takia) in his presence.®

Bega Begam woke (us) up, and said: ‘It is time for
prayers. His Majesty ordered water for ablution® made
ready where he was, and so the begam knew that he was
awake. She began a complaint, and said to him: ‘ For
several days now you have been paying visits in this
garden, and on no one day have you been to our® house.
Thorns have not been planted in the way to it. We hope
you will deign to visit our quarters also, and to have a
party and a sociable gathering there, too. How long will
you think it right to show all these disfavours to us help-
less ones? We too have hearts. Three times you have
honoured other places by visits, and you have run day and
night into one in amusement and conversation.’ (306)

When she had finished, his Majesty said nothing, and

1 Khana, lit., house.
2 pahr. Gul-badan names the Hindistani division of time into

watches on which her father had commented as being a novelty to
himself. (Mems., 331.)

3 It seems, as again later on, that they fell asleep where they were
seated, on mattresses and provided with pillows.

that prayer is better than sleep.

went to prayers. At the first watch of the day he came
out and sent for his sisters and the begams, and for Dil-dar
Begam, and Afghani dghdcha, and Gul-nar dghdcha, and
Meywa-jan and Agha-jan, and the nurses (anagaha). We
all went, and he said not a word, so everyone knew he was’
angry. Then after a little he began: ‘Bibi, what ill-
treatment at my hands did you complain of this morning ?’
and: ‘ That was not the place to makea complaint. You all
(shuma) know that I have been to the quarters of the elder
relations (wali’u-n-ni’matan) of you all (shumaydan). It isa
necessity laid on me to make them happy. Nevertheless,
Iam ashamed before them because I see them so rarely.
It has long been in my mind to ask from you all a signed
declaration (sijlz), and it is as well that you have brought
me to the speaking-point. Iam an opium-eater. If there
should be delay in my comings and goings, do not be angry
with me. Rather, write me a letter, and say: ‘‘ Whether
it please you to come or whether it please you not to come,
we are content and are thankful to you.’’’

Gul-barg Begam wrote to this effect at once, and he
settled it with her. Bega Begam insisted a little, saying:
‘The excuse looked worse than the fault.? (314) We com-
plained in order that your Majesty might lift up our heads
by your favour. Your Majesty has carried the matter to
this point! What remedy have we? You are Emperor.’
She wrote a letter and gave it to him, and he made it up?
with her also.

On February 18th, 1584 (Sha'ban 14th, 941 H.), he
set out from the Gold-scattering Garden and marched for
Gujrat, to fall upon Sultan Bahadur. They confronted one
another at Manhasur (Mandsur) ; a battle was fought, and
Sultan Bahadur, on his defeat, fled to Champanir. Then

his Majesty resolved to pursue him. Sultan Bahadur left
Champanir and went towards Ahmadabad.! His Majesty
took the country of Ahmadabad also, and portioned out the
whole of Gujrat to his men. Ahmadabad he bestowed on
Mirza ‘Askari? Bahraich on Qasim Husain Sultan,®? and
Patan on Yadgar-nasir Mirza.

He himself, with a small following, went from Champanir
to visit Kanbayat® (Cambay). A few days later there came a
woman with news, and said: ‘ Why are you sitting here?
The men of Kanbayat have gathered, and will fall upon
you unless your Majesty rides off.’ The royal amirs
attacked the rabble,° and got them into their hands and
cut them in pieces. (31b)

His Majesty then went to Baroda, and from there
towards Champanir.’” We had settled down, when there

1 Taking his treasure with him, Sultan Bahadur fied before
Humayin to Champanir, Ahmadabad, Cambay and Diu.

2? Huméyin’s half-brother. .

3 Grandson, through a daughter, of Sultan Husain Mirza Baygra ;
on his father’s side an Uzbeg.

-4 Humayiin’s first cousin, the son of Babar’s half-brother Nasir.
He was a posthumous child. Mr. Beveridge has drawn my attention
to the fact,—of which there are other examples,—that he is called
Yadgar, a souvenir, of Nasir, his father.

5 This excursion preceded the allotment of fiefs. Gul-badan’s way
of putting the pursuit of Bahadur is borne out by some other writers.
This was Humayin’s first sight of the sea, and the spectacle seems to
have been more in her mind than was Bahadur. Akbar’s first sight of
the sea is also commemorated in the histories.

6 Abw’l-fazl calls them Bhils and Gawars. (H.B. I. 309.) They were
rude tribesmen acting in Bahadur’s interests. Maternal affection saved
the small royal camp. The ‘woman’ had a son a slave in it, and she
purchased his freedom by revealing the designs of her fellow-tribes-
men. Although Cambay had not furnished the assailants, it paid in
fire and pillage for the attack. It lay near, was an enemy’s town, and
such an incident as the onslaught of the Bhils would not allow of fine
distinction of race and person.

7 Behind this dull statement is a stirring episode. Humayiin took
Champanir after a four months’ blockade, by night escalade of a rock
so nearly perpendicular that seventy or eighty iron spikes had to be
driven in to allow ascent. Thirty-nine men climbed up. Bairam
Khan was the fortieth, Humayin the forty-first of the three hundred
who mounted. Such a Babar-like episode makes regret the keener
that Humayiin’s life was ruined and stained by his slavery to a drug.
The loot of Champanir was enormous; it had been regarded as im-
pregnable, and was full of treasure. It was taken in 1536 (943 H.).

was a tumult, and Mirza ‘Askari’s people left Ahmadabad
and came to the Emperor. They represented to him that
Mirza ‘Askari! and Yadgar-nasir Mirza had conspired, and
wished to go to Agra. On hearing this, he himself was~
forced to go; he left the important affairs of Gujrat [(?) its
pacification], and turned away and went to Agra. Here he
spent as much as a year.”

He then went to Chanada (Chunar), and took it,? and
also Benares. Shir Khan was in Charkanda,‘ and made
an offer of service, saying: ‘I am your old servant. Give
me a place with a fixed boundary in which I may establish
myself.’

His Majesty was considering this, when the king of
Gaur Bangala®’ came wounded and a fugitive. For this
reason he gave no attention (to Shir Khan), but marched
towards Gaur Bangala. Shir Khan knew that his Majesty
had gone there, and went himself also with a large
detachment of horse, and joined his son (Jilal Khan), who
was in Gaur with his servant Khawas Khan. Shir
Khan sent them out, and said: ‘Go and fortify Garhi.”® (32a)

Both came and occupied Garhi. His Majesty had
written to Jahangir Beg: ‘Advance a stage, and go up

Humayitn now relapsed into an evil mood of feasting and indolence,
He remained near Champanir, and affairs entered on a recurrent phase.
There was complete relaxation of discipline.

Gul-badan’s ‘we had settled down’ (nishista budim) allows the
inference that she and other ladies had joined the camp. A later
instance will be found of the inopportune presence of women and
children with the army. But it may mean merely ‘we were com-
fortably awaiting events’ in Agra.

1 He was thinking of having the khutba read in his own name in
Agra. Such aa aspiration in Humayiin’s brothers was encouraged by
his own abdications of sovereignty.

2 A fatal year which allowed Shir Khan to gather force. Gul-badan’s
recital of the historical events of this time has no value.

3 Shir Khan.

to Garhi.’ There was fighting, and Jahangir Beg was
wounded and many men were slain.

When the Emperor had spent three or four days in
Kohlgant (Colgong), it became advisable for him to march
on and halt near Garhi. He marched forward, and when
he came near Garhi, Shir Khan and Khawas Khan fled by
night, and he entered Garhi next day. Thence he went to
Gaur Bangala, and took it.

He was nine months in the far-away country of Gaur,
and named it Jannatabad.!

He was comfortably and safely in Gaur, when news came
that some of the amirs had deserted and joined Mirza
Hindal.?

Khusrau Beg? (kiikaltash) and Zahid Beg* and Sayyid
Amir® paid their respects to the mirza, and said: ‘The
Emperor has gone comfortably far away, and the mirzas,
Muhammad Sultan Mirza and his sons, Ulugh Mirza and
Shah Mirza, have again raised their heads,° and continually
keep showing themselves in company.’ (320)

1 City of Paradise. The demoralizing effects of life in Gaur were
felt under Akbar. Humayin, with his empire crumbling around him,
was now (as Jauhar testifies) ‘so much devoted to pleasure and sensual
enjoyment that, after the first month, he was never seen, as he was
always shut up in a private apartment of the palace.’ Naturally, Gul-
badan’s next item of narrative is of rebellion,—this time by her own
brother, Hindal.

2 He was only nineteen, and the crown may well have seemed at
anyone’s service. The date is 1538 (945H.). Huméayin in Gaur was
cut off from his capital by Shir Khan.

3 Babar first names him in 1507-8 as coming from Harat. There
are two men named Khusrau kikaltash by Babar, but they were not
contemporaries. One died in 1502-3, before the other came upon the
scene.

put to death by Mirza Kamran at Ghazni in 1547.

the husband of a daughter of Babar. Cf. App. s.n. Gul-rang.

6 Hindal had recently defeated them. (Erskine, II. 89 et seg..) For
causes of Hindal’s rebellion, and for Bega Begam’s part in it, see
Erskine’s Jauhar, J.c., p. 18.

ments and military stores in an underground place, and
would have loaded them on carts and sent them to Shir
Khan and the mirzas.! Mirza Hindal would not believe it,
so Mirza Niru-d-din Muhammad was sent to inquire into
the matter. He found the armour and accoutrements, and
had Bandagi Shaikh Bahlul killed.2) The Emperor, on
hearing news of it, set out for Agra.

He was coming by that side of the Ganges (i.e., the left
bank) opposite Mungir, when his amirs represented: ‘You
are a great king! Return by the way you came, lest Shir
Khan should say: ‘‘Forsaking his road of advance, he took
another of retreat.” ’? The Emperor returned to Mungir,
and brought many of his people and his family by boat up
the river as far as Hajipur-Patna.

When he went (to Bengal) he had left Qasim (Husain
Sultan Uzbeg) there. Now came news of Shir Khan’s
approach. Whenever there was fighting, the royal troops
won.

Just now Babi Beg (Jalair) came from Jaunpir and
Mirak Beg from Chanada (Chunar), and Mughal Beg from
Oude. (33a) As these three amirs joined the Emperor,
corn became dear.

Then,—such was God’s will,—they had halted without
precaution, when Shir Khan came and fell upon them.
The army was defeated, and many kinsmen and followers
remained in captivity. His Majesty’s own blessed hand
was wounded. Three days he remained in Chunar, and
then came to Arail.*

cannot have believed the accusation. Perhaps, however, her long
friendship with Niru-d-din’s daughter Salima would make her pen
discreet in blaming his murder of the shaikh.

3 It was Mu’yid Beg Duladai Barlds who urged this foolish point
of honour, and who thus led to the disaster at Chausa. He was a
cruel man as well as one ignorant in military matters. He was a
favourite of Humayin, but the Emperor’s followers rejoiced when

e died.

in method) is somewhat misleading. Mr. Erskine allows one to follow

When his Majesty reached the river’s bank, he stopped,
bewildered as to the crossing, and said: ‘How to cross
without boats!’ Then came the raja (Birbahan) with five
or six horsemen and led him through a ford. For four or
five days his people were without food or drink. At last
the raja started a bazar, so that the people of the army
lived some days in comfort and repose. The horses also
were rested. Many men who were on foot bought fresh
mounts. In short, the raja rendered fitting and dutiful
services. Later on his Majesty gave him leave to go, and
at the hour of mid-day prayer came himself, safely and
comfortably, to the bank of the Jamna. The army
crossed ata ford they had found. A few days later they
came to Karra, where corn and grass were plentiful,
because it was his Majesty’s own country. (33)

When his people were rested, he went on to Kalpi, and
then marched on to Agra.

Before his arrival in Agra, he heard news that Shir
Khan was coming (from) the direction of Chausa. Great
anxiety fell upon his people.

Of many who were in that rout (at Chausa) there was
never heard, in any way soever, news or sign. Amongst
them were ‘Ayisha Sultan Begam, daughter of Sultan
Husain Mirza! (Bayqra); and Bachaka, who was a khalifa
of my royal father;? and Bega-jan kiika; and ‘Aqiga
Begam ;? and Chand Bibi, who was seven months with

the misadventures which culminated in the defeat. This—the rout at
Chausa—occurred near to where the Sdn falls into the Ganges and at
Chipat Ghat, on June 27th, 1539 (Safar 9th, 946H.). The statement
of Humayiin’s visit to Chunar, I do not find elsewhere. Chunar was
then held by royalists. The Arail named is presumably that near
Allahabad.

1 Wife of Qasim Husain Sultan Uzbeg, whose timely arrival gave
Babar so much satisfaction. (18a) Qasim had been Governor of Patna
(828), but, from the circumstance of his wife’s being at Chausa, would
seem to have left it with Humayin.

2 A Bachaka, who was a khalifa of Babar’s household, escaped with
him from Samargand in 1501 (907H.), some thirty-eight years before
the Chausa episode. Khalifa, as applied to a woman, denotes a servant
or slave who exercises surveillance over other women-servants, and has
charge of rooms,—an upper maid-servant.

child, and Shad Bibi, all three! (sic) of whom were of his
Majesty’s haram. Of these several people, he never heard
even a word, as to whether they were drowned or what
became of them. In spite of all possible inquiry and

search, what had become of them was never found out. :

His own illness? dragged on for forty days, and he then
grew better.

At this time, when Khusrau Beg (kakultdsh), and
Diwana Beg, and Zahid Beg, and Sayyid Amir, had come
on in advance of his Majesty, news again arrived that the
mirzas, Muhammad Sultan Mirza and his sons, had come
to Kanauj. (34a)

After Shaikh Bahlil’s murder, Mirzé Hindal went to
Dihli. He took with him Mir Fagr-‘ali and other well-
wishers to frustrate and disperse the mirzis. The mirzas
fled, and came into the Kanauj quarter. Mir Faqr-‘ali
brought Mirza Yadgar-nasir to Dihli. As there was
neither friendliness nor confidence between Mirza Hindal
and Mirza Yadgar-nasir, Mirza Hindal, when Mir Faqr- ali
made this mistake, sat down out of sheer annoyance and
besieged Dihli.*

When Mirzi Kamran heard these things, there arose
in him also a desire of sovereignty. With 12,000 fully
equipped horsemen he went to Dihli. Mir Faqr-‘ali and
Mirza Yadgar-nasir closed the city gates on his approach.
Two or three days later, Mir Faqr-‘ali, having made an
agreement, went and saw Mizra Kamran. He represented :
‘The news heard of his Majesty and Shir Khan may be
so and so.* Mirza Yadgar-nasir, from thought of his own
interest, does not wait on you. The advisable course at
this crisis is, that you should lay hands on Mirza Hindal,

Humiayin, ‘Aqiga is ‘of the haram.’

go to Agra, and not think of establishing yourself in
Dihli.’ (340)

Mirza Kamran gave heed to Mir Fagr-ali’s words, and
bestowed on him a head-to-foot dress. He then seized
Mirza Hindal and came to Agra. He visited the tomb of
Firdaus-makani,' saw his mother and sisters, and halted in
the Rose-scattering? Garden.

At this time Nur Beg brought word of his Majesty’s
coming. As Mirza Hindal was excluded from the presence
because of the murder of Shaikh Bahlil, he went to
Alwar.*

A few days after his Majesty’s arrival, Mirza Kamran
came from the Rose-scattering Garden and paid his respects
to him. We paid our respects on the evening of the day
he came. He took notice of this insignificant one, and was
kindly pleased to say : ‘I did not know you at first, because
when I led the army (whose footprints are victorious®) to
Gaur Bangala, you wore the high cap (ta@7), and now when
I saw the muslin coif’ I did not recognise you. And oh,
my Gul-badan, I used very often to think of you, and was
sometimes sorry, and said: ‘‘I do wish I had brought her !”
But at the time of the disaster (/jitrat) I was thankful I
had not, andI said: (35a) ‘‘ Thank God I did not bring Gul-
‘badan!” For although ‘“Aqiqa’ was young, I have been

the lachag as a square mantle worn by women, doubled into a

consumed by a hundred thousand regrets and cares, and
have said: ‘‘ Why did I take her with the army ?”’’

A few days later he came to see my mother. He had
with him the Holy Book. He commanded the attendants
to retire’ for awhile, and they rose and there was privacy.
Then he said to dam (Dil-dar Begam) and this insignificant
one, and to Afghani dghdcha, and Gul-nar aghdcha, and
Nar-gul dghdcha, and my nurse (anaga): ‘ Hindal is my
strength? and my spear;® the desirable light of my eyes,
the might of my arm, the desired, the beloved. . May what
I do be right! What shall I say to Mirzi Muhammad
Hindal about the affair of my* Shaikh Bahlal? What was
to be has been! Now there is no anger in my heart
against Hindal. If you do not believe it’... He had
lifted up the Holy Book when her Highness my mother,
Dil-dir Begam, and this poor thing snatched it from his
hand. All cried, ‘May what you do be right! Why do
you say such things?’ _

Then again he spoke: ‘How would it be, Gul-badan, if
you went yourself and fetched your brother, Muhammad
Hindal Mirza?’ (35b) Her Highness, my mother, said: ‘ This
girlie (dukhtarak) is young. She has never made a journey
(alone). If you approved, I would go.’ His Majesty said:
‘If I give you this trouble, it- is because it is clearly
incumbent on fathers and mothers to feel for their chil-
dren. If you would honour him with a visit, it would be a
healing-balm applied for us all.’

Then he sent Mir Abi’l-baga® with her Highness my

news: ‘She has come to see me!’ Muhammad Hindal
Mirzaé made his mother happy by giving her honourable
meeting. He came with her from Alwar, and paid his
duty to his Majesty. About Shaikh Bahlil he said: ‘He
used to send arms and military appurtenances to Shir
Khan. When this was ascertained, I killed the shaikh on
account of it.’

To put it briefly: in a short time came news that Shir
Khan had come near Lakhnau.

In those days his Majesty had a certain servant, a
water-carrier. (36a) As he had been parted from his horse
in the river at Chausa and this servant betook himself to
his help and got him safe and sound out of the current,
his Majesty now seated him on the throne. The name of
that menial person we did not hear, some said Nizam,
some said Sambal. But to cut the story short, his Majesty
made the water-carrier servant sit on the throne, and
ordered all the amirs to make obeisance to him. The
servant gave everyone what he wished, and made appoint-
ments. For as much as two days the Emperor gave royal
power to that menial. Mirza Hindal was not present at
his court;? he had taken leave, and had again gone to
Alwar with the intention of getting arms ready. Neither
did Mirza Kamran appear. He was ill, and sent to say to
his Majesty: ‘Gifts and favours of some other kind ought
to be the servant’s reward. What propriety is there in
setting him on the throne? Ata time when Shir Khan is
near, what kind of affair is this to engage your Majesty ?’

In those days Mirza Kamran’s illness increased amaz-
ingly. He became weak and so thin that his face was not
in the least his own, and there was no hope of his life. (36b)

1 Hindal was received in the presence of Kamran and other kinsmen.
Humayin said to Kamran: ‘You know who is to blame! Why did
Hindal rebel?’ Kamran passed on the question to Hindal himself,
who, with profound shame, pleaded that being young he had listened
to bad advice, and begged forgiveness. (Erskine’s notes on Stewart’s |
Jauhar, B. M. Add. 26,608.)

By the Divine mercy he grew better. He suspected that
the Emperor’s mothers,' by his Majesty’s advice, had given
him poison. His Majesty came to hear of this, and
instantly went to see the mirza and swore that he had
never had such a thought, nor given such an order to any
one. Nevertheless, Mirza Kamran’s heart was not purged.
Afterwards he got worse, day after day, and he lost power
of speech.

When news came that Shir Khan had left Lakhnau, the
Emperor marched towards Kanauj, and left Mirza Kamran
in Agra to act for him. In a few days the mirza heard
that he had made a bridge of boats and crossed the Ganges.
On this, he himself marched out of Agra towards Lahr.”

We had settled down? when he sent‘ a farmdan like a
king’s, and said: ‘ You’ are commanded to go with me to
Lahor.’ He must have said® to his Majesty about me
something of this sort: ‘I am very ill and very miserable
and lonely, and I have no one’ to sympathize with me. (37a)
If you will order Gul-badan Begam to go with me to Lahor,
it will be a real favour and kindness.’ For his sake his
Majesty will have said: ‘She shall go.’ Two or three
days after the Emperor had gone towards Lakhnau, the
mirza sent a farman,® in royal style, to the effect: ‘ Most
assuredly you will come with me.’ Then my mother must
have said: ‘ She has never travelled apart from us.’ He
replied :® ‘If she has not travelled alone, do you also go
with her.’ He sent as many as 500 troopers and trusty
grooms, and both his foster-father and his foster-brother,
and said (to my mother): ‘If she may not go with me (to

Lahor), come all of you one stage.’ When one stage was
reached, he began to declare, on his oath: ‘I will not let
you go.’ Then he took me by main force, with a hundred
weepings and complaints and laments, away from my
mothers, and my own mother and my sisters, and my
father’s people, and my brothers, and parted us who had
all grown up together from infancy.?

I saw that the Emperor’s command also was in the
affair. I was helpless. (37b) I wrote a suppliant letter,
saying: ‘I never expected your Majesty to cut off this in-
significant one from your service, and to give her to Mirza
Kamran.’ To this humble note he sent a compassionate
answer (saldm-nama), to this effect: ‘I had no heart to part
with you, but the mirza persisted, and was miserable, and
begged very hard, and I was obliged to trust you to him.
For just now there is important work? on hand. God
willing, I will send for you when it is settled.’

When the mirza was starting, many people, amirs and
traders and so on, made preparation with the intention of
letting their wives and families march under his escort to
Lahor. When we reached (the city) news came of a battle
on the Ganges, and that defeat had befallen the royal
army.®

At least there was this limit to misfortune,—his Majesty
and his brothers came safely through the peril.* Our other
relations’ came from Agra by way of Alwar to Lahor. (38a)

1 It must be remembered that Gul-badan’s husband, Khizr Khwaja,
was a brother of Aq Sultan (Yasin-daulat), Kamrdan’s son-in-law, and
Kamran may have had other motives than affection for desiring her
presence, ¢.g., the attraction of her husband’s contingent.

2 The opposition of Shir Khan, soon to be closed at Kanauj. Gul-
badan’s enforced departure with Kamran saved her a painful and
hazardous flight.

3 May 17th, 1540 (Muharram 10th, 947H.). Mirza Haidar gives an
admirable account of it as ‘the battle of the Ganges.’ Gul-badan’s full
brother, Hindal, led the van at Kanauj, and defeated Shir Khan’s son,
Jalal. Hindal was a successful general. ‘Askari, Kamran’s full brother,
was defeated by Khawas Khan.

4 As at Chausa, so at Kanauj, Humayiin was nearly drowned. Here
he was saved by Shamsu-d-din Muhammad of Ghazni, whose wife,
under the sobriquet of Ji-ji anaga, became a nurse of Akbar. :

Just now the Emperor said to Mirza Hindal: ‘‘Aqigqa
Begam disappeared in that first interregnum (/itrat'), and
I repented extremely, and said: ‘‘ Why did I not kill her in
my own presence?” Now, again, it is difficult to convey
‘women with us.’ Mirza Hindal answered: ‘What it would”
be to your Majesty to kill a mother and a sister, speaks for
itself! So long as there is life in me, I will fight in their
service. I have hope in the most high God, that,—poor
fellow as I am,—I may pour out my life’s blood for my .
mother and my sisters.’ :

Then the Emperor set out for Fathipar (Sikri) with
Mirza ‘Askari and Yadgar-nasir Mirza and the amirs who
had come safely off the battlefield.?

Mirza Hindal sent on before him? her Highness his
mother, who was Dil-dar Begam, and his own sister, Gul-
chihra Begam, and Afghani aghdcha, and Gul-nar aghacha,
and Nar-gul dghacha, and the amirs’ wives and families, etc. .
He was marching along when the Gawars pursued him
in great numbers. (38)) Some of his troopers charged
and defeated them. An arrow struck his horse. There
was much fighting and confusion. Having saved the
helpless women from the bond of the Gawars, he sent
on (to Lahdr) his mother and sister, and many of the
amirs’ people, etc., and went to Alwar. Here he got
together tents and pavilions and numerous requisites,
and then started for Lahor. He arrived in a few days,

1 4.e., battle of Chausa. Fitna would read more easily here.
Perhaps behind fitrat is the notion of relaxation in effort, or of an
interval between two periods of good fortune.

2 Amongst them was Haidar Mirza, who describes the fugitives as
‘broken and dispirited, and in a state heartrending to tell.’ Sikri must
have rubbed salt into their wounds, since it recalls Babar’s triumph.
noe halting-place there was his garden, a token of his genius for

ving.

3 The known enemy, Shir Khan, was in the rear. With Hindal’s
marriage-feast fresh in mind, one may give a thought to Sultanam.
She was probably of this party, since her husband’s contingent was
with Humayiin, and he was not on his jagir of Alwar.

4 Asp.t-mubartk, (?) the horse which had the happiness to bear him.
Perhaps asp is a mistake for some word to which ‘blessed’ would be a
more fit adjective.

and brought what was wanted for the princes and the
amirs.

His Majesty alighted in Khwaja Ghazi’s garden near
Bibi Haj-taj.1 Every day there was news of Shir Khan;
and during the three months that the Emperor was in
Lahor word was brought day after day: ‘Shir Khan has
advanced four miles,’ ‘ six miles,’ till he was near Sirhind.

One of the amirs was named Muzaffar Beg. He was a
Turkman. The Emperor sent him with Qazi ‘Abdu-l-lah
to Shir Khan to say: ‘ What justice is there in this? I
have lefi you the whole of Hindtstan. Leave Lahor alone,
and let Sirhind, where you are, be a boundary between you
and me.” (392) But that unjust man, fearless of God, did
not consent, and answered: ‘I have left you Kabul. You
should go there.’

Muzaffar Beg marched at once, and sent on an express to
say: ‘A move must be made.’ As soon as this message
came, his Majesty set off. It was like the Day of Resurrec-
tion. People left their decorated places and furniture just
as they were, but took with them whatever money they
had. There was thankfulness to God, because mercifully a
ford was found across the Lahdr water (Ravi) where every-
one crossed. His Majesty halted a few days on the river’s
bank. Then an ambassador came from Shir Khan. The
Emperor had decided to see him next morning, when
Mirzé Kamran made a petition, saying: ‘ To-morrow there

garden, and Humayin’s in Khwaja Dost munshi's.

Bibi Haj, Bibi Taj, Bibi Nar, Bibi Hir, Bibi Gihar, and Bibi
Shabaz are said to have been daughters of ‘Aqil, brother of ‘Ali
(Muhammad's son-in law). They were famous for piety and asceticism.
After the murder of Imam Husain at Kerbela, these ladies left Syria
for India in obedience to a secret intimation. They alighted outside
Lahor at the place named by Gul-badan and where their shrine now
is. They converted many of the townspeople to their faith, and thus
angered the, presumably Hindi, governor. He sent his son to
command their departure, but the son fell under their influence, and
remained near them. This still more angered his father, who went out
against them and their followers with an armed force. The ladies
prayed that their honour might be preserved, and they not be seen
by strange men. Immediately the earth opened and swallowed them.

will be an entertainment, and Shir Khan’s envoy will be
present. If I may sit on a corner of your Majesty’s carpet,
so that there may be distinction between me and my brothers,
it will be a cause of my exaltation.”

Hamida-bani Begam says it was his Majesty who wrote
and sent the following verse to the mirza? I had heard
that he sent it to Shir Khan by the envoy. This is the

verse :
‘ Although one’s image be shown in the mirror,
It remains always apart from one’s self.’ (39b)
‘It is wonderful to see one’s self in another form :
This marvel will be the work of God.’

When Shir Khan’s ambassador arrived he paid his
respects.

The Emperor’s blessed heart was cast down. He fell
asleep in a sad mood, and saw in a dream a venerable man,
dressed in green from head to foot and carrying a staff,
who said : ‘ Be of good cheer; do not grieve ;’ and gave his
staff into the royal hand. ‘The most high God will give
you a son who shall be named Jalalu-d-din Muhammad
Akbar.’ The Emperor asked: ‘What is your honourable
name?’ He answered: ‘The Terrible Elephant,? Ahmad
of Jam ;’ and added: ‘ Your son will be of my lineage.”*

1 For an account of Kaimran’s odious and fruitless treachery see
B. & H., II. 200 et seqg.. The meaning of his message to Humayin is
not clear to me. Perhaps he wished to show the envoy that he was
not on the level of Hindal and ‘Askari, but able to claim recognition as
a ruler and as Humayiin’s equal. Perhaps it was a hint to Humayin
that he must recognise Kamran’s equality in the lands in which
the latter had been supreme while he himself ruled in Dihli.

At this time Humayin was strongly advised to put Kamran to
death. He refused, but later on and after a dreary waste of good nature,
his filial piety had to yield to the common-sense of his victimized
followers and allow the blinding.

* At the time when the verse was written Hamida was not married.
The discussion in 1587 (circa) of a ‘point’ between the ladies is a
living touch to the old MS.._ Which was likely to be right, —Hamida
who might later have heard the story from her husband, or Gul-badan
who was in Lahér? Gul-badan puts the difference of opinion gently
but does not surrender, and leaves her readers to draw their own
inferences.

In those days Bibi Gunwar! was with child. Everyone
said: ‘A son will be born.’ In that same garden of Dost
munsht and in the month of Jumada’u-l-awwal, a daughter
was born whom they named Bakhshi-banu.

At this time his Majesty appointed Mirza Haidar to take
Kashmir. Meantime, news was brought that Shir Khan
was there. A wonderful confusion followed, and the
Emperor decided to march off next morning. (40a)

While the brothers were in Lahor, they conferred and
took counsel and asked advice, but they did not settle on
any single thing. At last the news was: ‘Shir Khan is
here.’ Then, as there was no help for it, they marched off
at the first watch of the day (9 a.m.).

The Emperor’s wish was to go to Kashmir, where he had .
sent Mirzé Haidar Kashghart; but news of the mirza’s
success had not yet come, and people counselled: ‘If your
Majesty were to go to Kashmir, and the country was not
conquered at once, it would—with Shir Khan in Lahor—be
a very difficult time.’

Khwaja Kilan Beg? was in Sialkot, and disposed to serve
his Majesty. With him was Mu’yid Beg, who wrote:
‘The khwaja greatly wishes to serve you and would come,
but he has Mirza Kamran to consider. If your Majesty
would come quickly, his help would be made easy in an
excellent way.’ The Emperor at once took arms and
equipment, and set out to go to the khwaja, and joined
company with him and brought him along.®

however, the coming child’s mother had to be of the same descent, since
Humiayiin’s claim to rank as of the saint’s lineage required no prophetic
announcement. Indeed this story seems to cast doubt on that claim.
Akbar’s mother, Hamida, was of the line of Ahmad of Jam. So, too,
was Bega (Haji) Begam. Another of the same family was Babi or
Bani digha, wife of Shihabu-d-din Ahmad of Nishapir.

1 To give value to Ahmad’s prophecy, Bibi Ginwar ought also to
have traced back to him. She does not seem to have been a woman
of rank. The girl now born was at least the third child of Humayin,
there having been Al-aman and ‘Aqiga, children of Bega Begam and
now both dead.

2 The well-known old servant of Babar and now one of Kamran’s
chief amirs.

3 The begam’s story here does not agree with that of Mr. Erskine’s
authorities. Mi’yid Beg is the ill-adviser of the march from Bengal
to Chausa. :

The Emperor was pleased to say: ‘With my brothers’
concurrence, I shall go to Badakhshan. (40b) Let Kabul
remain the fief of Mirza Kamran.’ But Mirza Kamran
would not consent to (his Majesty’s) going to Kabul, and
said: ‘In his lifetime the Emperor Firdaus-makani gave ——
Kabul to my mother (Gulrukh Begam). It is not right
(for you) to go to Kabul.’ .

Then said his Majesty: ‘As for Kabul, his Majesty
Firdaus-makdni often used to say, ‘‘ My Kabul I will give
to no one; far from it! Let none of my sons covet it.
There God gave me all my children, and many victories
followed its capture.’ Moreover, this expression of opinion
is recorded many times in his Wadgqi‘a-nama. What was
the good of my showing kindness to the mirza from
civility and brotherliness, if he now keep on talking in
this way !’

Let his Majesty talk as he would, pacifying and con-
ciliating, the mirza resisted more and more. When he saw
that there was a large following with Mirza Kamran, and
that the mirzaé was in no way willing for him to go to
Kabul, he had no resource but to move towards Bhakkar
and Multan. Having arrived in Multan, he halted one
day. (41a) A small quantity of corn was obtained in the
fort and having divided that little amongst his men, he
marched on till he came to the bank of a river which was
seven rivers in one. He stood distracted. There were
no boats, and he had a large camp with him. Then there
came word that Khawas Khan,’ with several amirs, was
coming up behind.

There was a Baluchi named Bakhshii (sic) who had forts

than Kabul on his way to Badakhshan.

of the Hindistani Language,’ C. J. Lyall, p.1n.. ‘ Hindo represents
an earlier Hindau, being the modern Persian for the ancient Hendava,
t.e., & dweller in the country of the sapta hindi (Sk. sapta sindhu), or
‘seven rivers,’’ now called, with the omission of two (probably the
Saraswati and Drishadwati or Ghaggar) the Panj-ab.’

and many men. His Majesty sent him a banner and
kettledrums, and a horse, and a head-to-foot suit, and asked
for boats and alsofor corn. After atime Bakhshu Baluchi
got together and sent about a hundred boats, full of corn
too, for the royal service,—a proper attention which pleased
the Emperor very much. He divided the corn amongst his
people, and crossed the water! safe and sound. May mercy
be shown to Bakhsht for his dutiful service !

After a weary journey, they reached Bhakkar at last.
The fort is in the middle of the river and very strong.
The governor, Sultan Mahmud (Bhakkari),? had fortified
himself in it. (41b) The Emperor alighted safe and well
over against the fort, near which was a garden* made by
Mirza Shah Husain Samandar.*

At length his Majesty sent Mir Samandar to Shah
Husain Mirza with this message: ‘We have come into
your territory under compulsion. May your country be
blessed to you! We shall not take possession of it. Would
to Heaven you would yourself come and pay us your
respects, and do us the service which is our due! We
intend to go to Gujrat, and should leave you your own
country.’ By tricks and wiles, Shah Husain kept his
Majesty as much as five months in Samandar; then he
sent a person to wait on him, and to say: ‘I am arranging
my daughter’s wedding-feast, and I send (someone) to wait
on you. I shall come (later).’ His Majesty believed him,
and waited still three months. Sometimes there was corn
to be had, sometimes not. The soldiers killed and ate
their horses and camels. hen his Majesty sent again, by

bank of the Indus. Shah Husain felt no anxiety as to military opera-
tions after hearing that Humayiin hadcamped here. Char-bagh seems
to denote a royal and private garden.

Shaikh ‘Abdu-l-ghafir,! to ask: ‘How much longer will

you be? What prevents you from coming? (42a) Things

have come to such a pass that there is inconvenience, and

many of my men are deserting.’ The reply was: ‘My
daughter? is promised to Mirza Kamran, and a meeting
with me is impossible. I could not wait on you.’

As at this time Mirza Muhammad Hindal crossed the
- river, some said he might be going to Qandahar.? On
hearing this his Majesty sent several people after him to
make inquiry and to say: ‘It is reported that you plan
going to Qandahar.’ When questioned, the mirza said:
‘People have given a wrong impression.’ On this the
Emperor came‘ to see her Highness my mother.

The mirza’s haram and all his people paid their respects
to his Majesty at this meeting. Concerning Hamida-banu
Begam, his Majesty asked: ‘Who is this?’ They said:
‘The daughter of Mir Baba Dost.’ Khwaja Mu'azzam® was
standing opposite his Majesty, who said: ‘This boy will
be one of my kinsmen (too ?)."° Of Hamida-banu he said:
‘She, too, is related to me.’ (42b)

In those days Hamida-bani Begam was often in the
mirza’s residence (mahall). Another day when his Majesty
came to see her Highness my mother, he remarked: ‘ Mir

Indus and about forty miles north of Sehwan. Patis in the sarkér
of Siwistan, a little to the east of the highroad to Hyderabad, and not
far north of Meani, the scene of Napier’s victory of 1843. I am in-
debted to Major-General Malcolm R. Haig for the information that
Pat is ‘now a ruin, having been destroyed in the latter part of the
eighteenth century when two Kalhora chiefs of Sind called in the
Afghans to quell domestic troubles.’

* Leaving his troops to prosecute the siege of Bhakkar, and passing
through Darbila where was his cousin, Yadgar-nasir. From the
wording it might be supposed that Gul-badan was with her mother in
Pat, but I believe she was in Kabul at this time.

Baba Dost is related to us. It is fitting that you should
give me his daughter in marriage.’ Mirza Hindal kept on
making objections, and said: ‘I look on this girl as a sister
and child of my own. Your Majesty is a king. Heaven
forbid there should not be a proper alimony, and that so a
cause of annoyance should arise.”! ,

His Majesty got angry, and rose and went away. Then
my mother wrote and sent a letter, saying: ‘The girl’s
mother has even before this been using persuasion.” It is
astonishing that you should go away in anger over a few
words.’ He wrote in reply: ‘Your story is very welcome
to me. Whatever persuasion you may use, by my head
and eyes, I will agree to it. As for what they have written
about alimony, please Heaven, what they ask will be done.
My waiting eye is on the road.’ My mother fetched his
Majesty, and on that day she gave a party. When it was
over, he went to his own quarters. (48a) On another day
he came to my mother, and said: ‘Send someone to call
Hamida-bani Begam here.’ When she sent, the begam
did not come, but said: ‘If it is to pay my respects, I was
exalted by paying my respects the other day. Why should
I come again?’ Another time his Majesty sent Subhan
Quli, and said: ‘Go to Mirza Hindal, and tell him to send
the begam.’ The mirza said: ‘Whatever I may say, she

1 This looks like a side-glance at the wasted fortunes of royalty.
No kingdom! No revenues! Whence then the dowry? It is clear
from the sequel that the important point was being pressed.

Jauhar says that Hamida had been already asked in marriage, but
not betrothed or perhaps promised. Her objections to marry Humayin
seem personal, and may indicate preference for another and dislike for
him. She is said to have been fourteen years old and Humayin was
thirty-three, an opium-eater, and much married already. Her objec-
tions, whatever their true basis, must have been strong or they could
hardly have survived, for Gul-badan to record, through the many years
of prosperity and proud motherhood which her husband’s renewed
sovereignty in India and her son’s distinction secured to her.

Behind Gul-badan’s story of the wooing of Hamida there were
doubtless many talks over ‘old times’ when the royal authoress was
freshening her memory for her literary task, begun (it seems probable)
when she was about sixty-five and Hamida some few years younger.

will not go. Go yourself and tell her.’ When Subhan
Quli went and spoke, the begam replied: ‘To see kings
once is lawful; a second time it is forbidden. I shall
not come.’ On this Subhan Quli went and represented
what she had said. His Majesty remarked: ‘If she is
not a consort (n@ makram), we will make her a consort
(mahram).’

To cut the story short: For forty days the begam
resisted and discussed and disagreed. At last her highness
my mother, Dil-dar Begam, advised her, saying: ‘ After
all you will marry someone. Better than a king, who is
there? The begam said: ‘Oh yes, I shall marry some-
one; but he shall be a man whose collar my hand can
touch, and not one whose skirt it does not reach.’ Then
my mother again gave her much advice. (43b)

At last, after forty days (discussion), at mid-day on
Monday (fault) Jumidu-l-awwal (sic) 948H. (September,
1541), and in Patr (sic), his Majesty took the astrolabe into
his own blessed hand and, having chosen a propitious hour,
summoned Mir Abi‘l-baqgé and ordered him to make fast
the marriage bond. He gave the mir two laks of ready
money for the dower! (nikahana), and having stayed three
days after the wedding in Patr, he set out and went by
boat to Bhakkar.

He spent a month at Bhakkar and he sent Mir Abi'l-baqga
to Sultan Bhakkari. The mir fell ill while away, and went
to the mercy of God.?

His Majesty then gave Mirza Hindal leave to go to
@andahar, and he dismissed Mirza Yadgar-nasir to his own
place, Lar. He himself went towards Seawan® (Sehwan),

1 Perhaps the ladies romance a little here. Humiayiin was certainly
at a loss for money now and later.

2 This is not a historic account of the death. He was sent to
Yadgir-nasir and was shot while crossing the river on his return to
Rihri by adherents of Shah Husain. His death caused great grief to
Humayin. (B. & H., II., 222.)

3 At the end of September, 1541. Hindal’s leave is a sisterly gloss
on his acceptance of an invitation to Qandahar given by its governor,
Qaracha Khan.

which is six or seven days’ journey from Tatta.1 Sehwan
has a strong fort, in which was Mir ‘Alika, a servant of his
_Majesty the Emperor.? There were several cannon, so no
one could possibly go near. Some of the royal soldiers
made trenches, and got near and gave him (‘Alika) advice,
and said: (44a) ‘ Disloyalty is not well at such a time,’ but
- Mir ‘Alika did not agree with them. Then they made a
mine and cast down a tower, but they could not take the
fort. Corn became dear and many men deserted. The
Emperor spent six or seven months there.

Mirza Shah Husain treacherously laid hands on the
royal soldiers in all directions, and made them over to his
people, and said: ‘ Take them and throw them into the salt
sea.’ Three’ or four hundred would be gathered into one
place and flung into boats and thrown into the sea, till as
many as 10,000 were cast forth.

“As after this there were few men even with the Emperor,
(? Shah Husain) filled several boats with cannon and
muskets, and came from Tatta against him. Sehwan is
near the river. (? Mir “Alika) hindered the coming of the
royal boats and provisions, and sent to say: ‘(?) I am
maintaining my loyalty. March off quickly.’ Having no
remedy, the Emperor turned to Bhakkar.

When he came near and before he could reach it, Mir
(Shah) Husain Samandar had sent word to Mirza Yadgar-
nasir: (44b) ‘If the Emperor, when he is retreating, should

reference to other writers. Humayin had intended to go to Tatta at
this time, and was diverted from the journey by a slight success of
arms. He then besieged Sehwan.

2 Certainly not so, for ‘Alika was an Arghin and follower of Shah
Husain. Perhaps Gul-badan wrote or intended to convey that ‘Alika
had served Babar as once all the Arghiins had done. Perhaps she
has confused the import of the story that Mir ‘Alika when sent by
Shah Husain to take command of Sehwan, actually passed through
Humiayiin’s lines and the bazar without recognition as an enemy.

3 Text, thirty—stsad. No wonder Humayiin’s force vanished! He
is said to have left Hindistan, 7.e., Lahor, with a following of 200,000.
This presumably included Kamran’s party, and was made up of
soldiers and women, children, traders, servants, etc.. At this time
Humayin had lost both Hindal’s and Yadgar-nasir’s troops.

come near Bhakkar,} do not let him in. Bhakkar may
remain your holding. I am with you; I will give you my
own daughter.’ The mirza believed him and did not allow
the Emperor to enter the fort, but wished to make him go
on, either by force or fraud.

His Majesty sent a messenger to say: ‘ Baba,” you are as
a son to me. I left you in my stead, so that you might
help me in case of need. What you are doing is done by
the evil counsel of your servants. Those faithless servants
will be faithless to you also.’ Whatever his Majesty urged
had no effect.2 Then he said: ‘ Very well! I shall go to
Raja Maldeo.* I have bestowed this country on you, but
Shah Husain will not let you keep.it. You will remember
my words.’ Having said this to the mirza, the Emperor
marched away by way of Jisalmir, towards Maldeo. He
reached Fort Dilawar (Dirawal), on the raja’s frontier, a
few days later. (45a) He stayed there two days. Neither
corn nor grass was to be had. He then went to Jisalmir,
and on his approach the raja sent out troops to occupy the
road, and there was fighting. The Emperor and some
others went aside off the road. Several men were wounded:
Alash® Beg, brother of Shaham Jaldir and Pir Muhammad
the equerry, and Raushang the wardrobe-keeper, and some
others. At length the royal troops won and the infidels
fled into the fort. That day the Emperor travelled 60 kos
(civ. 120 miles), and then halted on the bank of a reservoir.

Next he came into Sitalmir, where he was harassed all
day till he reached Pahlidi, a pargana of Maldeo. The

raja was in Jodhpir, and sent armour and a camel’s-load
of ashrafis, and greatly comforted his Majesty by saying:
‘You are welcome! I give you Bikanir.” The Emperor
halted with an easy mind, and despatched Atka Khan
(Shamsu-d-din Ghaznavi) to Maldeo, and said: ‘ What will
his answer be ?”4 .

In the downfall and desolation in Hind, Mulla Surkh,
the librarian, had gone to Maldeo, and had entered his
service. (450) He now wrote: ‘ Beware, a thousand times
beware of advancing. March at once from wherever
you are, for Maldeo intends to make you prisoner. Put no
trust in his words. There came here an envoy from Shir
Khan who brought a letter to say: ‘“‘By whatever means
you know and can use, capture that king. If you will do
this, I will give you Nagor and Alwar and whatever place
you ask for.”’ Atka Khan also said when he came: ‘ This
is no time for standing.’ So at afternoon prayer-time the
Emperor marched off. When he was mounting, they
captured two spies and brought them bound before him.
He was questioning them when suddenly they got their
hands free, and one snatched a sword from the belt of
Muhammad Gird-baz? and struck him with it, and then

_wounded Baqi Gualiart. The other at once unsheathed?
a dagger and faced the bystanders, wounded several and
killed the Emperor’s riding-horse. They did much mischief
before they were killed. (46a) Just then there was a cry,
‘Maldeo is here!’ The Emperor had no horse fit for
Hamida-bani Begam. He may have asked for one for
her from Tardi Beg,* who apparently did not give it. He
then said: ‘Let the camel of Jauhar, the ewer-bearer, be
got ready for me. I will ride it, and the begam may have

my horse.’ It would seem that Nadim! Beg heard that his
Majesty was giving his horse to the begam and thinking
of riding a camel, for he mounted his own mother on a
camel and gave her horse to the Emperor. ~~

His Majesty took a guide from this place, and mounted
and rode for ‘Umrkot. It was extremely hot; horses and
(other) quadrupeds? kept sinking to the knees in the sand,
and Maldeo was behind. On they went, thirsty and hungry.
Many, women and men, were on foot. (46b)

On the approach of Maldeo’s troops, the Emperor said
to Ishan(Isan)-timar Sultan and to Mu'nim Khan* and a
number of others: ‘You all come slowly, and watch the
enemy till we have gone on a few miles.’ They waited; it
grew night, and they missed their way.

All through that night the Emperor went on, and at
dawn a watering-place was found. For three days the
horses had not drunk. He had dismounted when a man
ran in, shouting: ‘The Hindus are coming up in numbers,
mounted on horses and camels.’ Then the Emperor dis-
missed Shaikh ‘Ali Beg (Jalair), and Raushan kika and
Nadim kika, and Mir Payanda Muhammad, brother of
Muhammad Wali, and many others.

They recited the fatiha, and his Majesty said: ‘Go, fight
the infidels!’ He thought: ‘Ishan-timir Sultan, and
Mu'nim Khan,‘ and Mirza Yadgar,® and the rest whom we
left behind, have been killed or captured by these people
who have now come to attack us.’ He mounted and left
the camp with a few followers.

Of the band which his Majesty had sent out to fight
after reciting the fatiha, Shaikh ‘Ali Beg struck the Rajput
captain with an arrow, and cast him from his horse. (47a)

Several more (of the royal troop) hit others with arrows ;
the infidels turned to flee, and the fight was won. They
brought in several prisoners alive. Then the camp went
slowly, slowly on; but his Majesty was far ahead. Those
who had recited the fatiha came up with the camp.

There was a mace-bearer named Bihbid. They sent him
galloping after the Emperor, to say: ‘ Let your Majesty go
slowly. By Heaven’s grace, a victory has been vouchsafed,
and the infidels have fied.’ Bihbid himself was taken to
the presence, and conveyed the good news.

His Majesty dismounted, and a little water even (ham)?
was found, but he was anxious about the amirs, and said:
‘What has happened to them?’ Then horsemen appeared
in the distance, and again there was a cry: ‘God forbid!
Maldeo!’® His Majesty sent a man for information, who
came running back and said: ‘Ishan-timur Sultan, and
Mirza Yadgar, and Munim Khan are all coming, safe
and sound.’ They had missed their way. Their return
rejoiced the Emperor, who rendered thanks to God.

Next morning they marched on. For three days they
found no water. (47b) On the fourth, they came to some
very deep wells, the water of which was extraordinarily
red. The Emperor halted and alighted near one of the
wells; Tardi Beg Khan was at another; ata third, Mirza
Yadgar, and Mu'‘nim Khan, and Nadim kika; and at the
fourth, Ishan-timir Sultén, and Khwaja Ghazi, and
Raushan kika.

As each bucket came out of the wells into reach, people
flung themselves on it; the ropes broke, and five or six

persons fell into the wells with the buckets. Many perished

from thirst. When the Emperor saw men flinging them-
selves into the wells from thirst, he let anyone drink from

and non-combatants.

his own water-botile. When everyone had drunk his fill,
they marched on again at afternoon prayer-time.
After a day and a night they reached a large tank. The

horses and camels went into the water and drank so much ~

that many died. There had not been many horses, but
there were mules and camels. (48a) Beyond this place
water was found at every stage on the way to ‘Umrkat,}
which is a beautiful place with many tanks.

The rana? gave the Emperor an honourable reception,
and took him into the fort, and assigned him excellent
quarters. He gave places outside to the amirs’ people.
Many things were very cheap indeed ; four goats could be
had for one rupt. The rana made many gifts of kids and
so on, and paid such fitting service that what tongue could
set it forth ?

Several days were spent in peace and comfort.

The treasury was empty. Tardi Beg Khan had a great
deal of money, and the Emperor having asked him for a
considerable loan, he lent 80,000 ashrafts at the rate of two
in ten. His Majesty portioned out this money to the
army. He bestowed sword-belts and cap-d-pie dresses on
the rana and his sons. Many people bought fresh horses
here.

Mir Shah Husain had killed the rana’s father. For this,
amongst other reasons, the rana collected 2,000 or 3,000
good soldiers and set out with the Emperor for Bhakkar.*
(480) |

In ‘Umrkot he left many people, and his family and
relations, and also Khwaja Mu‘azzam to have charge of the
haram. Hamida-bana Begam was with child. Three days
after his Majesty’s departure, and in the early morning of

Sunday, the fourth day of the revered Rajab, 949H.,5

1 The little desert town must indeed have seemed a haven after the
terrible journey, and not least so to the young wife who some two
months later became the mother of Akbar. Humayin reached ‘Umrkot

there was born his imperial Majesty, the world’s refuge
and conqueror, Jalalu-d-din Muhammad Akbar Ghazi. The
moon was in Leo. It was of very good omen that the birth
was in a fixed Sign, and the astrologers said a child so born
would be fortunate and long-lived. The Emperor was some
thirty miles away when Tardi Muhammad Khan took the
news to him. He was highly delighted, and by way of
reward and largesse (nisaér) for the tidings he forgave all
soever of Tardi Muhammad Khan’s past offences. He
gave the child the name he had heard in his dream at
Lahor, the Emperor Jalalu-d-din Muhammad Akbar.

On leaving this place, the Emperor went towards Bhakkar
with as many as 10,000 men who had gathered round him,
people of the rana and of the outlying tribes and Suidmas
(Sodhas) and Samichas. (49a) They reached the district of
Jun, where there was one of Shah Husain’s servants with
some troopers. He fled.1 Here there was the Mirror
Garden, a very pleasant and enjoyable place where the
Emperor alighted. He assigned its villages (? of Jin) in
jagir to his followers.

It is a six days’ journey from Jin to Tatta. The Emperor
was a8 much as six? months in Jun, and brought his family
and people and the whole ‘Umrkot party there.2 The
Emperor Jalalu-d-din Muhammad Akbar was six months
old when they took him to Jin. The party which had
come from various places with the royal family and the
haram now broke up. As for the rana, he marched off at
midnight for his own country, on account of a coolness‘
caused by some talk between him and Tardi Muhammad
Khan.’ All the Sudmas and Samichas went off by agree-

ment with him, and the Emperor was left alone, as before,
with his own people.

He sent brave Shaikh “Ali Beg (Jalair) and Muzaffar Beg
Turkman towards the large district of Jajka (Haj-kan). (49b)
Mirza Shah Husain sent a force to attack him, and there-
was a famous fight. At last Muzaffar Beg was routed and
fled, and Shaikh ‘Ali Beg (Jaldtr) was killed and perished
with all his men.?

A squabble arose between Khalid Beg? and Tarsh Beg, a
brother of Shaham Khan Jalair and his Majesty turned
all his favour to Tarsh Beg. So Khalid Beg deserted and
went with all his men to Mir Shah Husain. Then the
Emperor ordered Khalid Beg’s mother, Sultanam, to prison
and this made Gul-barg® Begam angry. Then he forgave
Sultanam and gave her leave to go to the blessed Makka
with Gul-barg Begam. Soon after this Tarsh Beg also
deserted. The Emperor cursed him, and said: ‘ For his
sake, I dealt harshly with Khalid Beg, who on this
account left the circle of the faithful for the circle of the
disloyal. Tarsh Beg will die young.’ So it was! Fifteen
days later, a servant killed him with a knife as he lay
sleeping in a boat. When the Emperor heard of it he
grew sad and thoughtful. (502) Shah Husain Mirza
brought boats up the river to near Jin, and his men and
the Emperor’s often fought on board, and many were killed
on both sides. Day by day there were desertions to Shah
Husain. In one of these fights was killed Mulla Taju-d-din
whom his Majesty held in the greatest favour as a pearl of
knowledge.

There was a squabble between Tardi Muhammad Khan
and Mu‘nim Khan. Mu‘nim Khan consequently deserted.

November, 1548.

Gul-barg of earlier episodes and a wife of Humayun.

Very few amirs remained; amongst them were Tardi
Muhammad Khan and Mirza Yadgar and Mirzé Payanda
Muhammad and Muhammad Wali and Nadim kika and
Raushan kiika and Khadang' the chamberlain. Then
there was word brought: ‘ Bairfm Khan has reached
Jajka (Haj-kan) on his way from Gujrat.’ The Emperor
was delighted, and ordered Khadang and others to give
him honourable meeting.

Meantime Shah Husain Mirza had heard of Bairam
Khan’s coming and sent to capture him. Bairam Khan
rashly went into a hollow, and there they fell upon him. (50))
Khadang the chamberlain was killed. Bairam Khan and
the rest escaped, and the khan came and paid his respects
to the Emperor.

At this time letters arrived (addressed to) Mirza Hindal
for his Majesty from Qaracha Khan, saying: ‘You have
been long near Bhakkar, and during the whole time Shah
Husain Mirza has given no sign of good-will but the
reverse. By Heaven’s grace, an easy way is open, and it is
best for the Emperor to come here (to Qandahar). This is
really advisable. If he will not come, come you yourself
without fail.’ As his Majesty’s coming was delayed,
Qaracha Khan went out and met Mirza Hindal, and made
over the town to him (in the autumn of 1541).

Mirza ‘Askari was in Ghaznin, and to him Mirza
Kamran wrote: ‘Qaracha Khan has given over Qandahar
to Mirza Hindal. Qandahar must be considered.’ His
idea was to take it from Mirza Hindal.

On hearing of these things, his Majesty came to his aunt
Khanzada Begam,? and said with great urgency: ‘ Pray do

2 From this it would seem that Khanzada was in Sind with
Humayin. No other writer, I believe, mentions this or the embassy
on which she is now sent. The Uzbegs and Turkmans do not appear
apropos here. If, as Gul-badan says,—and her authority is good,—
Khanzada now went to Qandahar, she will have gone on to Kabul,
possibly with Hindal after he surrendered the town to Kamran. Of
Mahdi Khwaja, Khinzada’s husband, I find no mention made by any

me the honour of going to Qandahar and advising Mirza
Hindal and Mirza Kamran. (51a) Tell them that the Uzbegs
and the Turkmans are near them, and that the best plan is
to be friends amongst themselves. If Mirza Kamran will
agree to carry out what I have written: to him, I will do
what his heart desires.’

Mirza Kamran came to Qandahar four days after the
begam’s arrival. Day after day he urged: ‘ Read the khutba
in my name’; and again and again Mirza Hindal said: ‘In
his life-time his Majesty Firdaus-makani gave his throne
to the Emperor Humayin and named him his successor.
We all agreed to this, and up till now have read the khutba
in his name. There is no way of changing the khutba.”*
Mirza Kamran wrote to her Highness, Dil-dar Begam :* ‘1
have come from Kabul with you in mind. It is strange
that you should not once have come to see me. (51b) Bea
mother to me as you are to Mirza Hindal.’ At last
Dil-dar Begam went to see him, and he said: ‘Now I shall -
not let you go till you send for Mirza Hindal.’ Dil-dar
Begam said: ‘ Khanzada Begam is your elder kinswoman,
and oldest and highest of you all. Ask her the truth
about the khutba.’ So then he spoke to Aka. Her High-
ness Khanzada Begam answered: ‘If you ask me! well!
as his Majesty Firdaus-makani decided it and gave his
throne to the Emperor Humayun, and as you, all of you,
have read the khutba in his name till now, so now regard
him as your superior and remain in obedience to him.’

To cut the matter short, Mirza Kamran besieged
Qandahar and kept on insisting about the khugba for four

historian after Babar’s death,—a singular fact and matched by the
similar disappearance of the great Khalifa. Abi’l-fazl names his
tomb. Cf. App. s.n. Khanzada.

1 She had a weary journey from Jin to Qandahar, and Kamran had
another, but less toilsome, from Kabul. Kamran kept Hindal besieged,
but there seems to have been a good deal of communication between
besiegers and beleaguered.

Our memory is better than the begam’s, and we remember that
Hindal found no difficulty in changing the khutbu to his own name in
ihli.

3 She would be probably with her son Hindal in the fort.

months. At last he settled it in this way: ‘ Very well!
the Emperor is now far away. Read the khutba in my
name and when he comes back, read it in his.’ As the
siege had drawn out to great length, and people had
gradually come to cruel straits, there was no help for it;
the khutba was read. (52a) He gave Qandahar to Mirza
‘Askari and promised Ghaznin to Mirza Hindal. When
they reached Ghaznin, he assigned the Lamghanat and the
mountain passes (Tangayha)! to the mirza, and all those
promises were false.”

Mirza Hindal went off to Badakhshan, and settled down
in Khost and Andar-ab. Mirza Kamran said to Dil-dar
Begam: ‘Go and fetch him.’ When she arrived, the
mirza said: ‘I have withdrawn myself from the turmoil
of soldiering, and even? Khost is a hermitage. I have
quite settled down.’ The begam answered: ‘If you intend
to lead the darvish-life, even? Kabul is a hermitage. Live
where your family and kinsfolk are. That is the better
plan.’ Then she made him come, and for awhile he lived
as a darvish in Kabul.

About this time, Mir Shah Husain sent to the Emperor
to say: ‘The course favouring fortune is for you to march
for Qandahar. That is the better plan.’ His Majesty
was willing, and replied: ‘ Horses and camels are scarce in
my camp; give me some to travel with to Qandahar.’ (52b)
Shah Husain Mirza agreed, and said: ‘ There area thousand
camels on the other side of the river, which I will send to
you as soon as you have crossed.’

At length the Emperor went on board boats, with kins-
folk and family, army and the rest, and travelled for three
days on the great river. At the frontier of Shah Husain
Mirza’s territory is a village called Nuasi.' Here they
halted, and his Majesty sent Sultan Quli, the head-camel-
driver, to fetch the camels. Sultan Quli brought a thousand,
all of which his Majesty gave to his amirs, and soldiers,
and others, ordering them to be apportioned.

The camels were such that one might say they had not
known city, or load, or man for seven, or rather seventy,
generations. As horses were few, many people took camels
to ride on, and what were left were assigned for the
baggage. Every camel which was mounted, at once flung
its rider to the ground, and took its way to the jungle. (53a)
Every pack-camel, when it heard the sound of horses’ feet,
jumped and bounded and tossed off its load, and went off
and away to the jungle. If a load was fixed so fast that,
jump as it would, it could not get it off, it carried it
away and ran with it into the jungle. This was the way
the Emperor started for Qandahar. Some 200 camels must
have gone off like this.

Shah Husain Mirza’s head-camel-driver Mahmid was
in Siwi (Sibi), and when the Emperor came near, he
strengthened the citadel and retired into it. His Majesty
came prosperously to within twelve miles’ distance. Then
word was brought that Mir Allah-dost and Baba Jajak?
had arrived in Siwi from Kabul two days earlier, and were
going on to (visit) Shah Husain Mirza. By them Mirza
Kamran had sent a dress of honour, and tiptichdq horses,
and much fruit, and they were to ask for Mirzi Shah
Husain’s daughter.?

The Emperor said to Khwaja Ghazi: ‘As there is the

‘Abdu-l-wahab, a lawyer with persuasive tongue.

tie of father and son! between you and Allah-dost, write and
ask him in what way Mirza Kamran stands towards me,
and what he will do if I go into his neighbourhood.’ (53b)
He also gave this order to Khwaja Kasak: ‘Go to Siwi,
and ask Mir Allah-dost whether he thinks it advisable for
me to come to Kabul.’ The khwaja set out, and the
Emperor said: ‘ We will not march till you have returned.’

When the khwaja came near Siwi, Mahmid, the head-
camel-driver, caught him, and asked: ‘ Why are you here?”
‘To buy horses and camels,’ he answered. Mahmud
ordered : ‘Feel under his arm and search his cap. Heaven
forbid that he should have brought a letter to win over
Allah-dost and Baba Jujuk.’ They searched, and brought
out the letter from under his arm. He had no chance to
twist it into a fold.22~ Mahmud took it and read it, and,
not letting the khwaja go, forthwith conveyed Allah-dost
and Baba Jajaik into the fort, and with various rough-
nesses made them swear: ‘We had no knowledge of his
coming here.’ (54a) (?) He has taken the initiative ;? and
‘Khwaja Ghazi is related to us and he was with Mirza
Kamran,’ and this is why he has written.’ Mahmud
decided to send all three to Shah Husain, and Mir Allah-
dost and Baba Jujuk spent the whole night smoothing
him down and entreating him, and in the end they were
set free.

Mir Allah-dost sent 3,000° pomegranates and 100 quinces.
for his Majesty’s use, and wrote no letter, because he was.
afraid it might fall into the wrong hands. By word of
mouth he sent to say: ‘If a letter should come from Mirza

but if not, it will be clear to your Majesty that nothing is
to be gained by going. You have few followers. What,
then, will happen ?’

Kasak came and reported this. The Emperor was
stupefied and bewildered, and said: ‘ What is to be done?
Where am I to go?’ They all consulted together. (54b)
Tardi Muhammad Khan and Bairam Khan gave it as their
opinion that it was impossible to decide to go anywhere but
to the north and Shal-mastan,! the frontier of Qandahar.
‘There are many Afghans in those parts,’ they said, ‘whom
we shall draw over to our side. Mirza ‘Askari’s people, too,
will join us.’ ;

Having settled it in this way, they recited the fatiha
and went, march by march, for Qandahar. Near Shal- ,
mastain they halted in a village named Rani (? Rali), but
as it had snowed and rained, and was extremely cold, they
determined to go on to Shal-mastan. At afternoon prayer-
time an Uzbeg youth, mounted on a sorry and tired-out
pony, came in, and cried out: ‘Mount, your Majesty! I
will explain on the way; time presses. There is no time
to talk.’2 The Emperor mounted the very hour the alarm
was given, and went off.

He went two arrows’ flight, and then sent Khwaja

‘Mu‘azzam and Bairam Khan to fetch Hamida-bani Begam.
(55a) They went and mounted her, but there was not a
chink of time in which to take the Emperor Jalalu-d-din
Muhammad Akbar. Just when the begam left the camp
to join his Majesty, Mirza ‘Askari came up with 2,000
troopers. There was an outcry, and when he heard it, he
entered the camp® and asked: ‘ Where is the Emperor ?’
People said: ‘He went hunting long ago.’ So the mirza
knew that his Majesty had gone away just as he himself

came in. Then he took possession of the Emperor Jalalu-
d-din Muhammad Akbar, and gave him in charge to his
wife Sultanam,! who showed him much kindness and
affection. He made all the royal followers march, saying :
‘Go to Qandahar.’

His Majesty, when he left, took the road to the mountains.
He went eight miles, and then travelled as fast as possible.”
(55) He had with him Bairam Khan, Khwaja Mu‘azzam,
Khwaja Niazi, Nadim kika® and Raushan kitka, and Haji
Muhammad Khan, and Baba-dost the paymaster, and Mirza
Quli Beg chili, and Haidar Muhammad the master of the
horse, and Shaikh Yusuf chilt, and Ibrahim the chamber-
lain, and Hasan ‘Ali, the chamberlain, and Ya qub the
keeper of the armoury, and ‘Ambar the superintendent and
the royal agent (mulk-mukhtar), and Sambal captain of a
thousand, and Khwaja Kasak.5

Khwaja Ghazi says :° ‘I also was in attendance.’ This
company went with the Emperor, and Hamida-bania Begam
says,° ‘There were as many as thirty people,’ and that of
women there was, besides herself, the wife of Hasan ‘Ali,
the chamberlain.

The prayer before sleep had passed before they reached
the foot of the mountains. The snow lay deep, so there
was no road to go up by. Their minds were full of anxiety
lest that unjust creature, Mirza ‘Askari, should follow
them. At last they found a way up, and climbed it in
some sort of fashion. They were all night in the snow,
and (at first) there was neither wood for fire nor food to eat.

hurried on.

Akbar was also Atha Khan (Shamsu-d-din Muhammad) and his wife,

that Khwaja Ghazi joined Humayin in Persia from Makka. This

They grew very hungry and feeble. (56a) The Emperor
gave orders to kill a horse. There was no cooking-pot, so
they boiled some of the flesh in a helmet, and some they
roasted. They made fires on all four sides, and with his
own blessed hand the Emperor roasted some meat which
he ate. He used to say: ‘My very head was frozen by the
intense cold.’

Morning came at last, and he pointed to another mountain,
and said: ‘There are people on that; there will be many
Biluchis there; and there we must go.’ On they went, and
reached the place in two days. They saw a few houses
near them, and a few savage Biluchis whose speech is the
tongue of the ghouls of the waste.

The Emperor halted on the skirt of the mountain. There
were about thirty people with him. The Biluchis saw him,
and collected and came near. He had settled comfortably
in his tent, so they knew from far off that he was halting.
They said to one another: ‘If we seize these people and
take them to Mirza ‘Askari, he will certainly give us their
arms, and many gifts besides.’ (56d)

Hasan ‘Ali, the chamberlain, had a Biluchi wife who
understood what the ghouls of the waste were saying, and
who made it known that they meant mischief. Early in
the morning the Emperor thought of marching on, but
they said: ‘Our chief is not here. When he comes, you
shall go.’ Besides this, the time had become unsuitable,
and so the whole night was spent there in strict watch-
fulness.

Part of the night had gone when the chief arrived. He
waited on the Emperor, and said: ‘A farman has come
from Mirza Kamran and Mirza ‘Askari, in which it is
written: ‘‘It is reported that the Emperor may visit your
dwellings. If he does, beware!—a thousand times beware !—

of letting him go. Seize him and bring him tous. You
- ean keep his goods and horses. Take him to Qandahar.”
As I had not seen your Majesty, I at first had this evil
thought, but now I will sacrifice my life and the lives of
my family, I have five or six sons, for your Majesty’s head,

or rather for one hair of it. (572) Go where you wish. God
protect you! Mirza ‘Askari may do what he likes.’ The
Emperor gave him a ruby and a pearl and some other
things.

At dawn he marched to honour Fort Baba Haji! by a
visit.. He reached it in two days. It belongs to the Garm-
sir,? and lies on the river (Halmand). There are many
sayylds there, and they waited on the Emperor and showed
him hospitality.

Next morning Khwaja ‘Alawalu-d-din (Jalalu-d-din)
Mahiid,° having left Mirza ‘Askari, came with an offering
of a string of mules, and one of horses and tents, etc.,
whatever he had. Once more the royal heart was at ease.
Haji Muhammad Khan kaki* brought thirty or forty
troopers and offered a string of mules.

Being helpless because of the disunion of his brothers®
and the desertion of his amirs, it now seemed best to the
Emperor,—with reliance on the Causer of causes,—to decide
upon going to Khurasan.° (57b)

_ After many stages and a journey of many days, he came
to parts adjacent to Khurasin. When Shah Tahmas (sic)
heard that he had reached the Halmand, he remained sunk
in wonder and thought, and said: ‘The Emperor Humayin
has come to our frontier by the perfidious revolution of the
firmament,—the firmament unpropitious and crooked of
gait! The Lord, whose existence is necessary, has led him
here!’ .
He sent all sorts of people to give honourable reception,

cultivated fields.

3 He was a revenue-collector of the mirza.

* Son of Baba Qishka, an intimate of Babar.

5 Kamran was master of Kabul and Ghazni, Qandahar, Khutlan and
Badakhshan. ‘Askari was attached to his full-brother’s fortunes, and
Hindal was a prisoner in Kabul. Shir Shah ruled Babar’s Indian
Empire, and Shah Husain was in Sind. Certainly there seemed no
‘crack’ to hold Humayin. The date is December, 1543.

nobles and grandees, low and high, great and small. All
came to the Halmand to meet the Emperor.!

The Shah sent all his brothers to meet his Majesty,—
Bahram Mirza, and Alqais Mirza, and Sam Mirza. All.
came and embraced him, and escorted him with full honour
and respect. As they drew near (the Shah) his brothers
sent him word, and he also came riding to meet the
Emperor. They embraced. (584) The friendship and
concord of those two high-placed pishas was as close as
two nut-kernels in one shell.? Great unanimity and good
feeling ensued, so that during his Majesty’s stay in that
country, the Shah often went to his quarters, and on days
when he did not, the Emperor went to his.

In Khurasan® his Majesty visited all the gardens and the
flower-gardens, and the splendid buildings put up by
Sultan Husain Mirza, and the grand structures of olden
days.

There was hunting eight times while he was in ‘Iraq,
and each time trouble was taken for him also. Hamida-
banu Begam used to enjoy the sight from a distance in
either a camel or a horse litter. Shahzada Sultanam,‘ the
Shah’s sister, used to ride on horseback, and take her stand .

1 He had crossed the river without receiving invitation or permis-
sion, because of Kamran’s threatened approach. The incidents of
Humayiin’s visit to Persia are very entertaining. (B. & H., II. 275
et seq..)

2 A figure of speech too compact to leave room for the facts. The
intercourse of the pashas was dramatic with human passion and foible.
Much of the story would be distasteful to Gul-badan’s family pride and
vexatious to her orthodoxy.

3 Not only in Khurasin but on and off the route to Tahmasp’s
summer quarters where the pashas met, did Humayiin visit note-
worthy places. He saw Harat as his father had done, and later his
devious journey took him to Jam, where he saw the shrine of his own
and of Hamida’s ancestor, the Terrible Elephant, Ahmad. He visited
the tomb of the Founder of the Safi dynasty at Ardabil, and the date
of his visit (1544) makes it probable that he trod that ‘ Holy Carpet’
of Ardabil which had been woven in 1540 for the shrine and which
now attracts our respectful admiration in the Oriental Section of the
Victoria and Albert Museum (S. K. M.).

4 This lady afforded Humfayin vital assistance in Persia, and even
pleaded for his life when it was in the balance. She was highly
esteemed by Tahmiasp, and had influence in state affairs.

behind her brother. His Majesty said (to Hamida-bant) :
‘There was a woman riding behind the Shah at the hunt.
She stood with her reins held by a white-bearded man.
People told me it was Shahzada Sultanam, the Shah’s
sister.’ (58) In short, the Shah showed the Emperor much
hospitality and courtesy, and laid a charge (on his sister)
to show motherly and sisterly hospitality and sympathy
(to Hamida-banu Begam).?

One day, when Shahzada Sultanam had entertained the
begam, the Shah said to her: ‘When (next) you offer
hospitality, let it be arranged outside the city.’ It was on
a beautiful plain, rather more than four miles out, that
they pitched tents (khaima) and folding-tents (khirga) and
an audience-tent (barga), and also set up chatr? and tag?

In Khurasan and those parts they use enclosing screens
(saradparda), but they do not put them at the back. The
Emperor set up an all-round screen after the Hindu fashion
(hindiana). Having pitched the tents, the Shah’s people
put coloured chicks (cheghha) all round. His kinswomen
and his paternal aunt were there, and his sisters and the
ladies of his haram, and the wives of the khans and sultans
and amirs, about 1,000 women in all splendour and
adornment.

That day Shahzada Sultanam asked Hamida-banu
Begam: (59a) ‘Are such chatr and faq met with in Hindu-
stan?’ The begam answered: ‘They say two dang‘ with
respect to Khurasan, and four dang with respect to Hin-

seems fittest to select from the several of ding or déinak. Others con-
ceivably applicable are ‘a small grain’ (anglice, peppercorn in this
connection), and the sixth of anything (anglice, the colloquial ‘frac-
tion’). Doubtless my difficulty is none to those experienced in colloquial
Persian.

Hamida’s ready use of a colloquial phrase to express that the
reputedly greater contains the less is neat and diplomatic.

dustan. When a thing is found in two dang, it is clear
it will be found better in four.’

Shah Sultinam said also, in reply to her own paternal
aunt, and in confirmation of the begam’s words: ‘ Aunt, ~
it is strange that you ask, ‘‘ Where are two dang? where
are four dang?” It is clear anything would be found better
and more wonderful (in four than in two).’

They passed the whole day very well in sociable
festivity. At the time of eating, all the amirs’ wives stood
and served, and the Shah’s ladies placed! food before
Shahzada Sultanam.

Moreover, they were hospitable? with all sorts of stuffs,
embroidered and others, to Hamida-bani Begam, as was
incumbent and fitting. The Shah went on in advance?®
and was in his Majesty’s quarters till the prayer before
sleep. (590) When he heard that Hamida-banu Begam
had arrived, he rose from the presence and went home.
To such a height of pleasantness and kindness was he
amiable !

Raushan kiika, spite of his former fidelity and services,
was now faithless, in that foreign and perilous country,
about some valuable rubies. These used to be kept in the
Emperor’s amulet-case ({wmar*), and of this he and the
begam knew and no one else. If he went away anywhere,
he used to give the amulet-case into her charge. One day
she was going to wash her head, so she bundled the case
up in a handkerchief, and put it on the Emperor’s bed.
Raushan kiika thought this a good chance to steal five
rubies. Then he agreed with Khwaja Ghazi, and trusted
them to him, meaning by-and-by to barter them away.

When the begam came back from washing her head, the
Emperor gave her the amulet-case, and she at once knew

from its lightness in her hand that it had lost weight, and
said so. (60a) The Emperor asked: ‘ How is this? Except
you and me, no one knows about them. What can have
happened? Who has taken them?’ He was astonished.

The begam said to her brother, Khwaja Mu‘azzam: ‘So
and so has happened. If at this pinch you will act the
brother to me and will make inquiry in some way quietly,
you will save me from what one may call disgrace. Other-
wise, a8 long as I live, I shall be ashamed in the royal
presence.’

Khwaja Mu'azzam said: ‘One thing occurs to me! I,
who am 80 closely connected with his Majesty, have not the
means to buy even a poor pony,' but Khwaja Ghazi and
Raushan kiika? have each bought themselves a tipichag
horse. They have not paid the money for them yet. This
purchase is not without a ray of hope.’

The begam answered: ‘O brother! now is the time
for. brotherliness! That transaction must certainly be
looked into.’ Khwaja Mu'azzam answered: ‘O elder
moon-sister !? tell no one about it. Heaven willing, I have
hope that the right will be righted.’ (60b)

He went out, and inquired at the house of the horse-
dealers : ‘ For what price did you sell those horses? When
is the money promised? What security has been given
for the payment?’ The dealers answered: ‘Both men
promised us rubies, and took the horses.’

From them he went to the khwaja’s servant, and said:
‘Where is the khwaja’s wallet, with his honorary dress
and his clothes ?# Where does he keep it?’ The servant
answered: ‘My khwaja has no wallet and no clothes.
He has one high cap which, when he goes to sleep, he

Muhammad. (Cf. list of companions of Humayin on his journey, 556.)

puts under his head or his arm.’ Khwaja Mu'azzam saw
the meaning of this, and made up his mind for certain
that the rubies were with Khwaja Ghazi, and were kept in
his high cap. He came and represented to his Majesty :_
‘I have found trace of those rubies in Khwaja Ghazi’s high
cap. In some way I will steal them from him. (61a) If he
should come to your Majesty and seek redress against
me, let your Majesty say nothing to me.’ The Emperor
listened, and smiled.

Khwaja Mu‘azzam then repeatedly played off tricks and
little jokes and pleasantries on Khwaja Ghazi, who came
and set it forth to the Emperor. ‘I am a lowly man,’
said he, ‘(?but) I have a name and a position. What
does the boy Khwaja Mu'azzam mean by playing off these
tricks and jokes, and making fun of me in this foreign
land, and insulting me?’ His Majesty said: ‘On whom
does he not? He is young. It often comes into his head
to do terrifying and ill-bred things. Do not take it to
heart. He is only a boy.’

Another day, when Khwaja Ghazi was seated in the
reception-room, Khwaja Mu‘azzam, pretending an accident,
filched his cap from his head. Then he took out the
matchless rubies, and laid them before his Majesty and
Hamida-bant Begam. His Majesty smiled, and the begam
was delighted, and said, ‘Bravo!’ and ‘Mercy be upon
you.’ (610)

Khwaja Ghazi and Raushan kika, in shame at their
deed, made secret communications to the Shah, and carried
_ their talk so far that his heart was troubled. His Majesty
saw that the Shah’s intimacy and confidence were not what
. they had been, and at once sent some of whatever rubies
and other jewels! he possessed as a gift to him, who then
said: ‘ Khwaja Ghazi and Raushan kiika are in fault; they
turned my heart from you, and truly I used to regard you

as a brother.’ Then the two sovereigns again became of
one mind, and made clean heart to one another.

The two wrong-doers were excluded from the presence,
and were made over to the Shah, who, when opportunity
occurred, got possession of those rubies,! and, as to the
men, ordered: ‘ Let them be kept in custody.”

His Majesty’s time in ‘Iraq was (now) spent happily.
In various ways the Shah showed good feeling, and every
day sent presents of rare and strange things. (62a)

At length the Shah despatched his own son and khans
and sultans and amirs with his Majesty to help him, to-
gether with good arms and tents, folding and audience
tents ; and chatr and faq and shamiana, excellently wrought,
and all sorts of the things necessary and fit for a king,
from the mattress-warehouse and the treasury and the
workshops and kitchen and buttery. In a propitious hour
those two mighty sovereigns bade one another farewell, and
his Majesty left that country for Qandahar.?

At the time of his departure, he asked pardon from the
Shah for the offence of those two faithless ones (Khwaja
Ghazi and Raushan kaka), and, having himself forgiven
them, took them with him to Qandahar.

When Mirza ‘Askari heard (1545) that he was on his
way from Khurasan and approaching Qandahar, he sent
the Emperor Jalalu-d-din Muhammad Akbar to Mirza
Kamran in Kabul, who gave him into the care of Dearest
Lady, Khanzada Begam, and our paternal aunt. (62b) He
was two and a half years old when she received him into
her charge. She was very fond of him, and used to kiss
his hands and feet, and say : ‘ They are the very hands and
feet of my brother the Emperor Babar, and he is like him
altogether.’

1 (?) those already bartered away.

2 They were, it would seem, let down by tent-ropes into the celebrated
underground prison of Sulaiman’s Diwén. (Jauhar, Stewart, 72.)

3 Humayin again indulged his love of travel and sights, and delayed
so long in Persian territory that the Shah, coming unexpectedly upon
him, angrily turned him off without ceremony.

When Mirza Kamran was sure that the Emperor was
approaching Qandahar, he went to Dearest Lady and cried,
and was very humble, and said with countless pains :' ‘Go
you (May your journey be safe!) to Qandahar to the
Emperor and make peace between us.’ 7

When she left (Kabul) she made over the Emperor
Akbar to Mirza Kamran, who gave him into the care of
(Muhtarima) Khanam. Then she travelled as fast as
possible to Qandahar. The Emperor besieged Mirza
Kamran? and Mirza ‘Askari for forty days in the city, and
he sent Bairam Khan on an embassy to Mirza Kamran.®
(63a) Mirza ‘Askari grew dejected and humble, admitted
his offences, and came out and paid his duty to the Emperor,
who then took possession of Qandahar (September 4th,
1545). He bestowed it upon the son of the Shah, who in
a few days fell ill and died. When Bairam Khan’ arrived,
it was given into his charge.

The Emperor left Hamida-banu Begam in Qandahar and
set out after Mirza Kamran. Dearest Lady, Khanzada
_ Begam, went with him, and at Qabal-chak® she had three
days of fever. The doctors’ remedies were of no avail, and
on the fourth day of her illness she passed to the mercy of
God. At first she was buried at Qabal-chak, but three
months later her body was brought to Kabul and laid in
the burial-place of my royal father.’

Ibrahim and Yadgar-nasir, all under surveillance. The embassy
reached Kabul before Khanzada left, and she travelled with Bairam on
his return to Humayin.

5 The begam’s chronology is faulty here. Bairam had returned
before the capitulation.

he had never made a hostile raid,} and now, all at once,
when he heard of his Majesty’s approach, desire to break
forth (? hunt) seized him, and he went into the Hazara
country.” (63b)

Mirza Hindal, who had chosen the darvish’s corner (in
Kabul), now heard of the Emperor’s return from ‘Iraq and
Khurasan, and of his success in Qandahar. He saw his
chance, and sent for Mirza Yadgar-nasir, and said: ‘ The
Emperor has come to Qandahar, and has been victorious.
Mirza Kamran sent Khanzada Begam to sue for peace, but
the Emperor did not agree to his sort of peace. The
Emperor sent Bairam Khan as his envoy, and Mirza
Kamran did not agree to what he proposed. Now the
Emperor has given Qandahar to Bairam Khan and has set
out for Kabul. Come now, let us, you and I, plan and
agree together, and scheme how to betake ourselves to his
Majesty.’ Mirza Yadgar-nasir agreed, and the two made
their plan and compact. Mirza Hindal said: ‘You make
up your mind to run away and when Mirza Kamran hears
of it, he will certainly say to me: ‘‘ Mirza Yadgar-nasir has
gone off; go and persuade him to come back with you.”
(64a) You go slowly, slowly on till I come. Then we will
go a8 quickly as we can and pay our respects to the
Emperor.’

Having so settled it, Mirza Yadgar-nasir ran away. The
news went to Mirza Kamran, who came back at once to
Kabul and sent for Mirzi Hindal and said: ‘Go and
persuade Mirza Yadgar-nasir to come back.’ Mirza Hindal
mounted at once, and joined Mirza Yadgar-nasir with all
speed. Then they travelled post-haste for five or six
days, when they were honoured by paying their duty to
the Emperor.

1 takht raftan. I do not know what the begam wishes to say.
Kamran had made hostile raids to Badakhshan and against the
Hazaras. One might read ‘ hunting expedition.’

2 He had a Hazara wife. Perhaps the passage about Kamran’s
hostile raid or hunting is merely an introduction to Hindal’s plan of
scape. (Cf, B. & H., II. 314, 315, for this story.)

They advised the Khimar? Pass as the best route. On
Ramzan 9th, 951H. (the third week of October, 1545), his
Majesty ordered a halt in that pass. News of this went to
Mirza Kamran on the same day and disturbed him greatly _—__
He had his tents taken out very quickly and encamped in
front of the Guzar-gah.? (640)

On the 11th of the same month, the Emperor ordered a

halt in the valley of (?) Tipa, and Mirza Kamran? also came
and drew up opposite to fight. Then all his amirs deserted
and were exalted by kissing the royal feet. Even Bapts‘
who was one of his well-known officers, deserted him with
all his following and was exalted by kissing the royal feet.
The mirza was left solitary and alone. ‘No one remains
near me,’ he thought, so he threw down and destroyed the
door and the wall of the house of Bapts® which was near,
and went softly, softly past the New Year’s Garden and the
tomb of Gul-rukh Begam,® dismissed his 12,000 troopers,
and went off.

who planned to go to Tatta and Bhakkar. In Khizr Khan
Hazara’s country, which lies on the way to Bhakkar, he
married Habiba Begam to Aq Sultan and entrusted her to
him, while he himself went on.

The victorious Emperor dismounted in triumph in the
Bala-i-hisar when five hours of the night of Ramzan 12th
had passed,—prosperously and with safety and good luck.!
All those followers of Mirza Kamran who had been promoted
to the royal service, entered Kabul with drums beating
(November, 1545).

On the 12th of the same month, her Highness my mother,
Dil-dar Begam, and Gul-chihra Begam, and this lowly
person paid our duty to the Emperor. For five years we
had been shut out and cut off from this pleasure, so now
when we were freed from the moil and pain of separation,
we were lifted up by our happiness in meeting this Lord

of beneficence again. Merely to look at him eased the
' gorrow-stricken heart and purged the blear-eyed vision. (65b)
Again and again we joyfully made the prostration of thanks.
There were many festive gatherings, and people sat from
evening to dawn, and players and singers made continuous
music. Many amusing games, full of fun, were played.
Amongst them was this: Twelve players had each twenty
cards and twenty shahrukhis. Whoever lost; lost those
twenty shahrukhis, which would make five misqals.2 Each
player gave the winner his twenty shahrukhis to add to
his own.®

To widows and orphans, and kinsfolk of men who had

who may follow the begam’s statement, says that the entry took place
on the 12th; other writers name the 10th. The only reason for dwelling
on the point is the agreement of Abi’l-fazl and Gul-badan.

to him by an Oriental writer is when Babar sends some to Shah Husain
Arghin who was ‘very fond’ of them, by Mir ‘Ali, the armour-bearer,
in 933H. (1526-27). No doubt such an easy means of speeding the
hours was known to the ladies of Babar’s family as early as to anyone
else, and Gul-badan is perhaps merely describing a new game. -

servants. In the days of his Majesty’s good fortune, great——_
tranquillity and happiness befell soldiers and peasants.

They lived without care, and put up many an ardent prayer

for his long life. (66a)

A few days later he sent persons to bring Hamida-banii
Begam from Qandahar. When she arrived, they celebrated
the feast of the circumcision of the Emperor Jalalu-d-din
Muhammad Akbar. Preparations were made, and after
the New Year? they kept splendid festivity for seventeen
days. People dressed in green,* and thirty or forty girls
were ordered to wear green and come out to the hills. On
the first day of the New Year they went out to the Hill of
the Seven Brothers and there passed many days in ease
and enjoyment and happiness. The Emperor Muhammad
Akbar was five years old when they made the circumcision
feast in Kabul. They gave it in that same large Audience
Hall Garden.* They decorated all the bazars. Mirza
Hindal and Mirza Yadgar-nasir, and the sultans and amirs,
decorated their quarters beautifully, and in Bega Begam’s
garden the begams and ladies made theirs quite wonderful
in a new fashion.

All the sultans and amirs brought gifts to the Audience
Hall Garden. (6b) There were many elegant festivities
and grand entertainments, and costly khi‘lats and head-to-

into Kabul by Humayin on Ramzan 10th, 953H., and says Akbar was
then four years, two months and five days old. ‘Some place the event
in the year 952H., but God knows the truth.’ It is strange that
there should be doubt about a historical event occurring not more than
fifty years before this resigned statement was made. Abii’l-fazl gives
Ramzan 12th, 952H. (November 17th, 1545), as the date of entry, which
would fix the feast for March, 1546, when Akbar was three years
and five months old. (Born October 15th, 1542.)

foot! dresses were bestowed. Peasants and preachers, the
pious, the poor and the needy, noble and plebeian, low and
high,—everybody lived in peace and comfort, passing the
days in amusement and the nights in talk.

Then the Emperor went to Fort Victory (Qila -i-zafar).?
In it was Mirza Sulaiman, who came out to fight but could
not stand face to face with his Majesty and so decided to run
away. The Emperor then entered the fort safe and sound.
Then he went to Kishm, where, after a little while, an
illness attacked his blessed frame and he slept day and
night.2 When he came to his senses, he sent Mun‘im
Khan’s brother, Faza’il Beg, to Kabul, and said: ‘Go!
comfort and reassure the people of Kabul. Set them at
ease in various ways.* Let them not quarrel. Say: ‘It
began ill, but has ended well.”’ (67a)

When Faza’il Beg had gone, he (Humayun) went one day
nearer Kabul.® ,

False news having been sent to Mirza Kamran in
Bhakkar, he set out post-haste for Kabul. In Ghazni he
killed Zahid Beg* and then came on. It was morning; the
Kabulis were off their guard; the gates had been opened in
the old way, and water-carriers and grass-cuts were going
in and out, and the mirza passed into the fort with all

1 Perhaps there is expressed here a difference of degree of honour in
the khi‘lat and sar-u-pii. ’

2 Sulaiman had not made submission to Humayiin,—hence this
expedition to Badakhshan.

3 He is said to have been insensible for four days. He was nursed
by Mah-chiichak and Bibi Fatima, an armed woman (ordi-beg?) of
the haram. She was, it would seem, mother of Zuhra dghd, the
wife of Khwaja Mu‘azzam, and to save whose life Akbar nearly lost his
own. (Elliot, V. 292; B. & H., II. 380 et seq...)

+ (?) As to his health, and their own safety from Kamran’s return,
and the continuance of the situation as he had left it. The illness
and convalescence lasted at least two months. He fell ill in Shahdan,
between Khishm and Qila‘-i-zafar, and Qaracha Khan, his vazir,
behaved with decision and good sense, so that Humayiin’s authority
was upheld.

5 Doubtful translation. Humiayiin is elsewhere said to have gone
to Qila‘-i-zafar to recruit, and Faza’il to have arrived in Kabul a few
hours after the first news there of the illness. Perhaps one of these
occurrences is behind this obscure statement.

these common people. He at once killed Uncle Muhammad
Alt who was in the hot bath. He alighted at the college
of Mulla ‘Abdu-l-khaliq.

When the Emperor was starting for Qila'-i-zafar, ~ae——__
placed Naukar? at the door of the faram. Mirza Kamran
must have asked: ‘ Who is in the Bala-i-hisar?’ and some-
one must have said: ‘It is Naukar.’ Naukar heard of
this and at once put on a woman’s dress and went out.
The mirza’s people laid hands on the doorkeeper of the
fort, and took him to Mirza Kamran, who ordered him to
be imprisoned. (67b) The mirza’s people went into the
Bala-i-hisér, and plundered and destroyed innumerable
things belonging to the haram, and they made settlement®
for them in Mirza Kamran’s court (sarkar). He put the
great begams into Mirza “Askari’s house and there he shut
up a room with bricks and plaster and (?) dung-cakes, and
they used to give the ladies water and food from over the
four walls.*

In what was once Mirza Yadgar-nasir’s house he put
Khwaja Mu‘azzam' and ordered his own wives and family
to stay in the palace where the royal haram and the begams
once lived. He behaved very ill indeed to the wives and
families of the officers who had left him for the Emperor,
ransacking and plundering all their houses and putting
each family into somebody’s custody.®

When the Emperor heard that Mirzi Kamran had come
from Bhakkar and was acting in this way, he returned
from Qila'-i-zafar and Andar-db safe and sound to Kabul.
Qila’-i-zafar he gave to Mirza Sulaiman. (68a)

When he came near to Kabul, Mirza Kamran sent for
her Highness my mother and for me from the house,}
and gave my mother orders to reside in the armourer’s
house. To me he said: ‘This is your house as well as
mine. You stay here.’ ‘Why,’ I asked, ‘should I stay
here? I will stay with my mother.’ He then went on:
‘Moreover, write to Khizr Khwaja Khan and tell him to
come and join me and to keep an easy mind, for just
as Mirza ‘Askari and Mirza Hindal are my brothers, so
is he. Now is the time to help.’ I answered: ‘ Khizr
Khwaja Khan has no way of recognising a letter? from me.
I have never written to him myself. He writes to me when
he is away, by the tongue of his sons. Write yourself what
is in your mind.’ At last he sent Mahdi Sultan? and Shir
“Ali to fetch the khan. From the first I had said to the
khan: ‘Your brothers may be with Mirza Kamran, (but)
God forbid that you should have the thought of going to
him and joining them. (68b) Beware, a thousand times
beware of thinking of separating yourself from the
Emperor.’ Praise be to God! the khan kept to what
I said.

When the Emperor heard that Mirzi Kamran had sent
Mahdi Sultan*® and Shir ‘Ali to fetch Khizr Khwaja Khan,
he himself despatched Qambar Beg, the son of Mirza Haji,
to the khan, who was then in his own jagir, and said:
‘Beware, a thousand times beware! Let there be no
joining Mirza Kamran. Come and wait on me.’ The
result of this auspicious message was that the khan set
out at once for court, and came to the ‘Uqabain (Hill of
the two eagles) and paid his respects.

When the Emperor passed Minar Hill, Mirzi Kamran
sent forward all his well-ordered soldiers under Shir

Afkan,' the father of Shiroya, so that they might go out
and fight. We saw from above” how he went out with his
drums beating, out beyond Baba Dashti, and we said,
‘God forbid you should fight,’ and we wept. (69@) When
he reached the Afghans’ village (Dih-i-Afghanan), the two >
vanguards came face to face. The royal advance-guard ai
once drove off the mirza’s* and, having taken many
prisoners, brought them to the Emperor. He ordered the
Mughals to be cut to pieces. Many of the mirza’s men
who had gone out to fight were captured and some of
them were killed and some were kept prisoners. Amongst
them was Juki Khan, one of Mirzéi Kamran’s amirs.

In triumph and glory and to the sound of music, the
Emperor entered the ‘Uqabain, with Mirza Hindal in attend-
ance and a splendid cavaleade. He set up for himself
tents and pavilions and an audience hall.2 He gave Mirza
Hindal charge of the Mastan bridge,® and stationed the
amirs one after another. For seven months he kept up
the blockade.’ (69b)

It happened one day that Mirza Kamran went from his
own quarters to the roof (? of the citadel), and that some-
one fired a gun from the ‘Uqabain. He ran and took him-
self off. Then he gave this order about the Emperor
Akbar: ‘ Bring him and put him in front.’® Someone let
his august Majesty (Humayun) know that Mirza Muham-
mad Akbar was being kept on the front, so he forbade the
guns to be fired and after that none were aimed at the

3 The begam underrates Humayiin’s victory. The struggle was

the ‘Ugqiabain, and did not take up quarters under a roof.

6 Under it flows the stream which issues from the defile of Dih-
i-ya‘qib. Cf. Ain, Jarrett, I. 404.

7 Of the Bala-i-hisar, the actual citadel.

8 Gul-badan’s narrative does not support the story that Maham
anaga exposed herself to save Akbar. This person,—who later on
became so important,—is nowhere named by the begam as in charge
of Akbar. Her husband, Nadim kika, is so named.

Bala-i-hisar. Mirza Kamran’s men used to fire from the
town upon the Emperor on the ‘Uqaibain. The royal
soldiers put Mirza ‘Askari to stand right in front and
made fun of him.

Mirza Kamran’s men also used to make sallies from the
fort, and on both sides many were killed. The royal troops
were often the victors and then the others had not courage
to come out. For the sake of his wives and children and
the begams and the household, etc., the Emperor did not
have the cannon fired nor did he place the large houses in
difficulty. (70a)

When the long siege was ended, they (i.e., the ladies)
sent Khwaja Dost Khawand madarchi! to his Majesty to
say: ‘For God’s sake, do whatever Mirza Kamran asks,
and save the servants of God from molestation.”

The Emperor sent for their use from outside nine sheep,
seven flasks of rose-water, one of lemonade, and seven sets
of nine dress-lengths® and some made-up jackets. He
wrote :* ‘For their sakes, I could not use force against the
citadel, lest I should give an advantage to their enemies.®

During the siege Jahan Sultan Begam who was two years
old, died. His Majesty wrote: ‘ Some time or other, if we
had used force against the citadel, Mirza Muhammad Akbar
would have disappeared.’

To finish the story: There were always people in the
Bala-i-hisar from evening prayer till dawn, and there was
a continuous uproar. The night Mirza Kamran went away,°
prayer-time passed and indeed bedtime came, and there
was no noise at all. (70b)

There was a steep stair by which people came up from

1 Follower of the Musalman saint Madar.

2 This message seems one from the imprisoned ladies. The khwaja
to whom it was entrusted may now, as in the earlier siege of Kabul,
have been Kamran’s envoy to Humayun.

3 parcha and nimcha dokhta. There seems between these words an
apposition which I render by the Englishwoman’s colloquial terms.

below. When all the city was asleep, there suddenly
sounded (on the stair) a clashing and clinking of armour,
so that we said to one another: ‘What a noise!’ Perhaps
a thousand people were standing in front (of the fort). We
were afraid, but all at once, without warning, off they went.
Qaracha Khan’s son Bahadur brought us word that the mirza
had fled.?

Having thrown a rope, they (or he) brought up Khwaja
Mu‘azzam by way of the wall.”

Our people and the begam’s people and the rest who
were outside, took away the door which had kept us
fastened in. Bega Begam urged: ‘Let us go to our own
houses.’ I said: ‘Have a little patience. We should
have to go by the lane and perhaps too someone will
come from the Emperor.’ At that moment ‘Ambar Nazir
came and said: ‘ This is the royal order: ‘‘ They are not to
leave that place till Icome.”’ Ina little while the Emperor
came and embraced Dil-dar Begam and me, and then Bega
Begam and Hamida-bant Begam, and said: ‘ Come quickly
out of this place. (71a) God preserve His friends from such a
house, and let such be the portion of His foes.’ He said to
Nazir: ‘Guard one side,’ and to Tardi Beg Khan: ‘Guard
the other, and let the begams pass out.’ All came out,
and we spent the evening of that day with the Emperor in
perfect content till night became morning. We embraced
Mah-chiichak Begam and Khanish agha@ and those of the
haram who had been with the Emperor on the campaign.

In Badakhshan Mah-chiichak had a daughter born. On
the same night the Emperor had this dream: ‘ Fakhru-n-
nisé’', my mama,®> and Daulat-bakht came in by the door,

1 Nizamu-d-din Ahmad says that Kamran escaped by a hole fashioned
for the purpose in the wall ‘on Khizr Khwaja’s’ side. This suggests
that Gul-badan’s husband connived at the evasion, unless one re-
members that Khizr Khwaja is a place outside Kabul.

2 I do not understand this sentence. Lither the followers of
Kamran drew the khwaja up into the fort-precincts to take him with
them, he having displeased Humaytin and being nearly connected
with him, or the ladies had him drawn up. He was, it seems, not a ~
prisoner. (670)

to have been Humiayiin’s own attendant in childhood.

and brought something or other, and then left me alone.’
Consider it as he might, he could only ask: ‘What does
this dream mean?’ Then it occurred to him that, as a
daughter had just been born, he would call her after the
two, and taking nisa@ from one, and bakht from the other,
would run them together into Bakht-nisa‘.

Mah-chuchak had four daughters’ and two sons,—Bakht-
nisi’ Begam, and Sakina-banu Begam, and Amina-banu
Begam, and Muhammad Hakim Mirza, and Farrukh-fal
Mirza. (71b) She was with child when the Emperor went
to Hindustan (1554), and bore a son, in Kabul, whom they
named Farrukh-fal Mirza. A little later Khanish dgha had
a son whom they named Ibrahim Sultan Mirza.

The Emperor spent a full year and a half in Kabul,
prosperously and happily, and in comfort and sociability.”

After taking flight from Kabul, Mirza Kamran went to
Badakhshan, and there stayed in Taliqian. One day the
Emperor was in the Inner Garden,? and when he rose at
dawn for prayers, news came that many of the amirs who
formerly were with the mirza, had gone to him again.
Amongst them were Qaracha Khan and Musahib Khan,
and Mubariz Khan and Bapis.* Many wretches fled by
night and went to join the mirza in Badakhshan.

In a propitious hour the Emperor also started for
Badakhshan. He besieged the mirza in Taliqan, and after
a time made him agree to submit and become obedient (72a)
when he waited on the Emperor, who bestowed Kulab on him,
and gave Qila-i-zafar to Mirzé Sulaiman, Qandahar (sic ;
(?) Kunduz) to Mirza Hindal, and Taliqan to Mirza ‘Askari.

1 Gul-badan does not name Fakhru-n-nis&' who became the wife of
Shah ‘Abi’l-ma‘ali and of Khwaja Hasan Nagshbandi. Perhaps she
is Bakht-nisa*.

2 From 1547; but a term of one and a half years does not quite fit
the facts. Huméayiin started for the north on June 12th, 1548.

4 Perhaps it may be taken as an indication of the degradation of
- ‘home life’ that Qaracha and Bapis again joined Kamran, although
the latter had exposed Qaracha’s son and a wife of Bapiis on the battle-
ments, with the utmost dishonour, and had killed three of the latter's
children and flung their bodies from the ramparts.

One day at Kishm! they had set up? the tents and there
was an assembly of the brothers, his Majesty the Emperor
Humayiin, and Mirzé Kamran, and Mirza ‘Askari, and
Mirza Hindal, and Mirza Sulaiman.® ~

His Majesty enjoined certain regulations‘ which are fixed
for interviews with kings, and said: ‘ Bring ewer and basin
so that we may wash our hands and eat together.’ He
‘washed his hands and Mirzé Kamran washed his. By
years Mirza Sulaiman (b. 920H.) had precedence of Mirza
‘Askari (b. 922H.) and Mirza Hindal (b. 925H.. So, to
show him respect, the two brothers set the ewer and basin
first before him.

After washing his hands Mirza Sulaiman did something
improper with his nose. Mirza ‘Askari and Mirza Hindal
were much put out, and said: ‘ What rusticity is this? (72b) |
First of all, what right have we to wash our hands in his
Majesty’s presence? but when he bestows the favour and
gives the order, we cannot change it. What sense is
there in these nose-wagging performances?’ Then the two
mirzas went and washed their hands outside and came
back and sat down. Mirza Sulaiman was very much
ashamed. They all ate at one tablecloth.

At this gathering his Majesty graciously remembered this
lowly person, and said to his brothers: ‘Gul-badan Begam
used to say in Lahor: ‘I wish I could see all my brothers
together!” As we have been seated together since early
morning, her words have occurred to my mind. If it be
the will of the most high God, may our assembly be kept
in His own place! He knows without shadow that it lies
not in my heart’s depths to seek any Musalman’s ill;

how then, should I seek the hurt of my brothers? May
God grant to you all the same divine and beneficent
guidance, so that our agreement and concord may endure!’
(73a)

There was wonderful cheerfulness and happiness because
many officers and their followers met their relations again,
for they too had been sundered because of their masters’
quarrels. Nay! one might rather say they had thirsted
for one another’s blood. Now they passed their time in
complete happiness.

On his return from Badakhshan the Emperor spent a
year and a half in Kabul and then resolved to go to Balkh.
He took up his quarters in the Heart-expanding Garden,!
and his own residence was over against the lower part of
the garden, and the begams were in Quli Beg’s house
because it was close by.

The begams said to the Emperor over and over again:
‘Oh, how the riwaj? will be coming up!’ He replied:

1 ¢.e., moved out of the city as a preliminary to marching.

2 The following account of this plant is taken from Conolly’s
Travels, I., 218 n.. It is translated by him from the Makhazinu-l-
adwiya (Treasury of Medicines). ‘ Ribas, rivds, riwaj or jigart (so
named from a person of Nishapir who first discovered it) is a shrub
two or three feet high, in appearance like beet (salg). In the middle
are one or two short stems of little thickness; the leaves, which
separate lengthwise like those of a lettuce, are downy and green, but
towards the root, of a violet or whitish colour. The heart is white,
delicate, juicy, acidulous and slightly astringent. Altogether the stalk
is the size of a man’s arm and when the plant is large every leaf
has the size of a man’s hand. Ard-shir was named Riéwand-dast
(thubarb-hand) from the length of his hands. The root is called
réiwand (rhubarb). The top is like the claw of a fowl. The flower is
red, and the taste is subacid with a little sweetness. The seed is
formed at the top of a long slender stalk which springs up annually
in the centre of the plant. It grows where snow lies and in mountainous
countries. The best grows in Persia. It is medicinally attenuating
and astringent, gives tone to the stomach, and improves the appetite.
A collyrium of the juice stréngthens the eye and prevents opacity, and
& poultice of it with barley-meal is a useful application to sores and
boils. The juice of the rivds is harsher than that of unripe grapes.’
For mention of the name riwdj see Tabaqit-t-akbari, Lucknow lith.
ed., 215; Tuzik-i-jahingiri, 47. Vullers, s.v., ete.. Mr. Erskine
writes (Mems., 138 n..): ‘It is described as somewhat like beetroot,
but much larger, red and white in colour, with large leaves that rise
little from the ground. It is a pleasant mixture of sweet and acid.
It may be the rhubarb, rawand.’ .

‘When I join the army, I shall travel by the Koh-daman,
so that you may come out and see the riwaj growing.’ It
was at afternoon prayer-time that he rode out! (of Kabul)
to the garden. Quli Beg’s house where the begams were, _
was close by and overlooked it, and his Majesty pulled up
as he passed, and all the begams saw him, and rose and
made the kérnish. (73b) Directly they had made this
salutation, he beckoned with his own blessed hand, to
say: ‘Come.

Fakhru-n-nisa mama and Afghani dghdcha went on a
little ahead. There was a stream in the lower part of the
garden which Afghani aghacha could not cross, and she fell
off her horse. For this reason there was an hour’s delay.’
At last we set out with his Majesty. Mah-chuchak Begam
not knowing, her horse went up a little. His Majesty was
very much annoyed about this. The garden was on 4
height and the walls were not yet made. Some vexation
now showed itself in his blessed countenance and he was
pleased to say: ‘ All of you go on, and I will follow when I
have taken some opium and got over my annoyance.’ He
joined us when we had, as he ordered, gone on a little.
The look of vexation was entirely laid aside and he came
with a happy and beautiful look in his face.

It was a moonlight night.(83a) We talked and told stories,®
and Mir (fault) and Khanish daghdcha and Zarif the reciter
and Saru-sahi and Shaham aghda sang softly, softly.

ill-omens such as the begam’s misadventures would seem.

knowing how to manage it; but the later and otherwise irrelevant
sentence about the unfinished wall suggests that the begam went too
high up the hill. The party is now on its way to see the rzwéj growing,
and Humiyiin’s temper is tried by the various contretemps of the ladies’
cavalcade.

royal tents nor the pavilions of the begams had arrived,
but the mihr-amez' tent had come. We all, his Majesty and
all of us, and Hamida-banii Begam sat in that tent till
three hours past midnight and then we went to sleep where
we were, in company with that altar of truth (Humayin).

Early next morning he wished to go and see the rtwdj on
the Koh. The begams’ horses were in the village, so the
starting-time passed before they came up. The Emperor
ordered that the horses of everyone who was outside
should be brought. When they came he gave the order:
‘ Mount.’

Bega Begam and Mah-chichak Begam were still putting
on their head-to-foot dresses, and I said to the Emperor:
‘If you think well, I will go and fetch them.’ ‘Go,’ he
answered, ‘and bring them quickly.’ I said to the begams
and to Mah-chichak Begam and the rest of the ladies: ‘I
have become the slave of his Majesty’s wishes. What
trouble waiting gives!’ I was gathering them all together
and bringing them when he came to meet me and said:
‘Gul-badan ! the proper hour for starting has gone by. (830)
It would be hot the whole way. God willing, we will go after
offering the afternoon prayer.’ He seated himself in a tent
with Hamida-bani Begam.? After afternoon prayers,
there was the interval between two prayers before the
horses arrived. In this interval he went away.’

Everywhere in the Daman-i-koh the riwaj had put up its
leaves. We went to the skirts of the hills and when it was
evening, we walked about. Tents and pavilions were
pitched on the spot and there his Majesty came and stayed.
Here too we passed the nights together in sociable talk, and
were all in company of that altar of truth.

In the morning at prayer-time, he went away to a

1 Perhaps a tent of Humayiin’s invention, in the name of which mihr
means sun. Cf. ‘another of his (Humiayiin’s) inventions was a tent
which had twelve divisions, corresponding to the signs of the Zodiac.
Every sign had a lattice through which the lights of the stars of
dominion shone.’ (Akbar-naéma, H. Beveridge I. 361.)

distance (birtin), and from there wrote separate letters to
Bega Begam and to Hamida-bani Begam and to Mah-
chichak Begam and to me and to all the begams,! saying :
‘Becoming spokeswoman of your own fault, write apolo-
gizing for the trouble you have given. God willing, I shall
say farewell and go to join the army either at Farza or
Istalif, and if not we shall travel apart.’ (74a)

Then everyone wrote to apologize for having given
trouble, and sent the letter for his holy and elevating
service.

In the end his Majesty and all the begams mounted and
rode by Lamghan to Bihzadi. At night each one went to
her own quarters, and in the morning they ate (? alone),
and at mid-day prayer-time rode to Farza.

Hamida-bani Begam sent nine sheep to the quarters of
each one of us. Bibi Daulat-bakht had come one day
earlier to Farza and had got ready plenty of provisions and
milk and curds and syrup and sherbet and so on. We
spent that evening in amusement. In the early morning
(we went) above Farza to where there is a beautiful water-
fall. Then his Majesty went to Istalif and passed three
days, and then in 958H.? marched towards Balkh.

When he crossed the pass, he sent farmdns to summon
Mirza Kamran and Mirza Sulaiman and Mirza ‘Askari, and
said: ‘Weare on the march to fight the Uzbegs; now is
the time for union and brotherliness. You ought to come
as quickly as possible.’ Mirza Sulaiman and Mirza ‘Askari
came and joined him. (74) Then march by march they
came to Balkh.

In Balkh was Pir Muhammad Khan,’ and on the first

directed against every and any one. It is possible, however, that a
page which might describe other untoward matters besides unpunctu-
ality, has been altogether lost. The sentence which now continues
the story, places all the ladies, deprived of their evening of talk and
amusement, in chastened solitude.

day his men sallied out and drew up in battle array. The
royal army carried off the victory, and Pir Muhammad’s
men tasted defeat and returned to the city. By the next
morning the khan had come to think : ‘ The Chaghatai are
strong; I cannot fight them. It would be better to get out
and away.’ Just then the royal officers joined in repre-
senting that the camp had become filthy, and that it would
be well to move to a desert place (dasht). His Majesty
ordered them to do so.

No sooner were hands laid on the baggage and pack-
saddles, than others raised a clamour and some cried out:
‘We are not strong enough.’ Since such was the Divine
will, the royal army took the road without cause from a
foe, without reason or motive. The news of their march
reached the Uzbegs and amazed them. Try as the royal
officers would, they produced not a scrap of effect. It
could not be hindered: the royal army ran away. (75a)

The Emperor waited a little, and when he saw that no
one was left, he too had to go. Mirza ‘Askari and Mirza
Hindal, not having heard of the confusion, rode up to the
camp. They found no one and saw that the Uzbegs had
gone in pursuit, so they too took the road and made for
Kunduz. After riding a little way, his Majesty stopped
and said: ‘ My brothers are not here yet: how can I go
on?’ He asked the officers and attendants whether anyone
would bring him news of the princes. No one answered or
went. Later on word came from the Mirza’s people in
Kunduz that they had heard of the disaster and did not
know where the princes had gone. This letter upset the
Emperor very much. Khizr Khwaja Khan said: ‘If you
approve, I will bring news.’ ‘God’s mercy on you!’ re-
joined his Majesty. ‘ May they have gone to Kunduz !’ (750)

Two days afterwards the khwaja, to the Emperor’s great

two grounds; (1) as to the threatened arrival of an overwhelming
Uzbeg force from Bukhara, and (2) lest Kamran should again take
Kabul and have their families at his mercy. The last was Perhaps the
dominant motive for the flight without a pursuer.

delight, brought word that Mirza Hindal had arrived at
Kunduz safe and sound. His Majesty gave Mirza Sulaiman
leave to go to his own place, Qila -i-zafar, and came himself
to Kabul (1550, 957H.).

While Mirza Kamran was in Kilab, a woman named
Tarkhan! Bega, who was a thorough cheat, showed him
the way by saying: ‘ Make a declaration of love to Haram
Begam.? Good will come of it.’ Acting on these words of
an ill-judging adviser, he actually sent a letter and a
kerchief? to Haram Begam by the hand of Begi dgha.
This woman laid the letter and the kerchief before the
begam and then set forth the mirza’s devotion and passion.
Haram Begam said: ‘Keep that letter and that kerchief
now and bring them again when the mirzis come home.’
Begi dgha then wept, and moaned, and coaxed, and said:
‘Mirza Kamran has sent you this letter and this kerchief ;
he has loved you a long time, and you have no pity for
him.’ (76a) Haram Begam began to show her disgust
and violent anger, and at once sent off for her husband,
Mirza Sulaiman, and her son, Mirza Ibrahim. She said
to them: ‘Mirza Kamran must have come to think you
are cowards, since he sends me a letter like this. Have:
I deserved to be written to in this way? He is as your
elder brother, and I am to him as a younger brother’s
wife. Send off a letter for me about it and rebuke
him. As for this wretch of a. woman, tear her piece by
piece. Let her be a warning to others that no man may
cast the evil eye of sinful thought upon another man’s
womanfolk. What does such a man deserve who, the son
of a mother, yet does such monstrous things, and who
fears neither me® nor my son ?’

Instantly hands were laid on Begi agha Bibi, condemned
of fate to die, and she was torn in pieces. In consequence
of this affair, Mirza Sulaiman and Mirza Ibrahim were
displeased with Mirza Kamran, or rather they became his
enemies. (76b) They wrote to the Emperor that Mirza
Kamran wished to thwart him and that this could not be
better seen than in his failure to go to Balkh with him.

After this the mirza, in Kulab,! could not find, in his
terror-stricken thoughts, any better remedy than to become
a darvish. He sent his son, Abu’l-qasim (Ibrahim) to
Mirza ‘Askari, and betook himself to Taliqan with his
daughter ‘Ayisha (Sultan Begam), and said to his wife
(Muhtarima Khanam): ‘Do you and your daughter follow
me later. I will send for you to whatever place I settle on:
Till then go and stay in Khost and Andar-ab.’ The khanam
was related to the Uzbeg khans, and some of her kinsfolk
let the Uzbegs? know: ‘If you want booty, there are goods
and men and women servants; take these, and let the lady
go free, for if ‘Ayisha Sultan Khanam’s* nephew hears
to-morrow (that she has been hurt), he will certainly be
very angry with you.’ By a hundred plans and wiles, and
with a hundred anxieties, and without her goods, she got
free from the Uzbeg bondage, and reached Khost and
Andar-ab. Here she stayed.

When Mirza Kamran heard of the royal disaster in
Balkh, he said: ‘The Emperor is not so friendly to me as
he was.’ (77a) So he left Kulab, and went hither and thither.

At this time (1550) his Majesty came out from Kabul.
When he reached the Qibchagq defile, he incautiously halted in
a low-lying place, and Mirza Kamran, coming from higher
ground, armed and equipped, poured down foes upon him.

did not dare even to make war without her consent. Perhaps
Kamrin’s devotion extended to the armed force she disposed of. It
was clearly in Tarkhan Bega’s eye.

Haram Begam, daughter of Sultan Wais Qibchiq, and sister of Chakr

Since such was the Divine will, a barbarian,—inwardly
blind, an ill-fated oppressor and ill-omened tyrant,—inflicted
a wound on the Emperor. The blow reached his blessed
head, and all his forehead and his dear eyes were stained
with blood.

It was just like it was in the Mughal war when the blessed
head of his Majesty Firdaus-makani, the Emperor Babar,
was wounded by a Mughal, and his high cap and the
turban wrapped round it were not cut, but his blessed head
was badly hurt. His Majesty Humayun used to say with
surprise: ‘I wondered at it, for cap and cloth were whole,
and yet the head was cut.’! The very same thing happened
now to his own head.

After the rout in the Qibchaq defile, his Majesty went to
Badakhshan, and Mirza Hindal, and Mirza Sulaiman, and
Mirza Ibrahim came and waited on him. (77b) He went?
to Kabul and the mirzas were in attendance, friendly
and united and at peace together, when Mirza Kamran
approached. His Majesty sent a message to Haram Begam:
‘Ask my kilin® to send me the army of Badakhshan as
quickly as possible and ready for service.’ In a few days,
—a very short time,—the begam had given horses and arms
to some thousands of men. She herself superintended and
took thought and she came with the troops as far as the
pass. From here she sent them forward, and while she
went back they went on and joined the Emperor.

1 «Tambol let fall a heavy sword-blow on my head. It is a singular
fact that, though not a thread of my cap of mail was injured, yet my
head was severely wounded.’ (Mems., 266. Also 111.)

2 Nizamu-d-din Ahmad, ‘after forty days.’

3 Cf. 77a n.. This story bears out Haram’s military reputation. -
Kamran’s power of attraction and Humaytin’s present risk can be
gauged by the fact that even after the defeat at Charikaran some 1,500
horse were with the former, and many amirs again went over to him.

It was now that the remarkable compact which effected Kamran’s
downfall was made between Humayin and his amirs. (B. & H., I.
338.) These swore fidelity by whatever oath would bind them and
then, at the instance of Haji Muhammad Khan kijka, Humayiin bound
himself to,—do as he was told. The compact was effective. The amirs
were the long-suffering victims of Humayin’s folly and their present
turning was, he admitted, justifiable. .

Hither at Charikaran or Qara-bagh there was fighting with
Mirzé Kamran and his Majesty’s army was successful.
The mirza fled to the mountain passes (tangayhd) and
Lamghanat.1

Aq Sultan (Yasin-daulat) who was the mirza’s son-in-
law, said in effect to him (gufta bashad): ‘You are con-
tinually thwarting the Emperor. What is the meaning of
it? It is not what should be. (78a) Hither make your
submission and obeisance to the Emperor or give me leave
to go, so that men may distinguish between us.’ Mirza
Kamran said fiercely: ‘Have my affairs come to such a
pass that you offer me advice?? Aq Sultan also spoke
angrily, ‘If I stay with you, my position will be unlawful,”
and left him at once, and went with his wife (Habiba) to
Bhakkar. The mirza wrote to Mirza Shah Husain, and
said: ‘Aq Sultan has displeased me and has gone away.
If he comes to Bhakkar, do not let his wife be with him.
Part them and tell him to go where he likes.’ Shah
Husain Mirza at once, on receiving the letter, deprived
Habiba Sultan Begam of the company of Aq Sultan and
let him depart for the blessed Makka.?

In the fight at Charikaran, Qaracha Khan® and many of
Mirza Kamran’s well-known officers were killed. ,

‘Ayisha Sultan Begam‘ and Daulat-bakht aghacha were
in flight for Qandahar, and were captured at the Khimar
Pass, and brought in by the Emperor’s people. Mirza
Kamran went to the Afghans,’ and stayed amongst them.
(78b)

From time to time his Majesty used to visit the orange-
gardens. That year also, according to his old habit, he
went to the mountain passes (tangayhda) to see the oranges..
Mirza Hindal was in attendance, and of the ladies (haraman),.

affairs. 7

there went Bega Begam, Hamida-banu Begam, Mah-chichak
Begam and many others. I could not go because my son,
Sa‘adat-yar, was ill at the time. One day his Majesty,
attended by Mirza Hindal, was hunting near the mountain
passes. They had very good sport. The Emperor went
towards where the mirza was hunting and had made a
very good bag. Following the rules of Chingiz Khan,
the mirza proffered his game to the Emperor, for it is a
rule of Chingiz Khan that inferiors should so act towards
their superiors. In short, he gave the Emperor all his
game. Then it occurred to him: ‘ There is still my sisters’
portion. (79a) They shall not complain again. I will hunt
once more and get them a share.’ Again he busied himself
in hunting, and had taken one head of game, and was
returning, when someone sent by Mirza Kamran blocked
the road, and shot an arrow at the unwitting mirza which
struck his blessed shoulder. Acting on the thought ‘God
forbid my sisters and womenfolk should be upset by news
of this,’ he wrote off at once to say: ‘Ill begun has ended
well! Do not be anxious, for I am getting better.’ To
finish the story: as it was hot, his Majesty went back to
Kabul, and in the course of a year the arrow-wound got
better.

A year later word was brought that Mirzé Kamran had
collected troops and was preparing for war. His Majesty
also, taking military appurtenances, set out for the mountain
passes (tangayhd) with Mirza Hindal. He went safe and
well, and made his honouring halt in the passes. Hour
by hour, and all the time, spies kept bringing news: ‘ Mirza
Kamran has decided that an attack must be made to-night.’
(790) Mirza Hindal went to the Emperor and submitted his
advice: ‘ Let your Majesty stay on this high ground, and
let my brother (nephew) Jalalu-d-din Muhammad Akbar
padshah stay with you, so that careful watch may be kept
on this height.’ Then he called up his own men, and
encouraged and cheered them one by one, and said: ‘ Put

earlier services in one scale and the service of this night
in the other. God willing! whatever claim you can make,
you shall be exalted to its degree.” One by one he allotted
their posts, and then called for his own cuirass and surtout,
and high cap and helmet.

His wardrobe-keeper had lifted up the wallet when
someone sneezed,” and he set it down for a while. Because
of this delay, the mirza sent to hurry him. Then the
things were brought quickly, and he asked: ‘Why were
you so long?’ The man replied: ‘I had lifted the wallet
when someone sneezed, and I therefore put it down. So
there was a delay.’ (80a)

The mirza replied: ‘You were wrong. (You should
have) said rather: ‘‘ May there be a blessed martyrdom.” ’
Then he went on: ‘Friends all! be my witness that I
abjure all forbidden things and all indecorous acts.’
Those present recited the fathiha and prayed: ‘ May there
be benediction.’ He said : ‘ Bring my vest and cuirass and
surtout.’ He put them on and went out to the trenches to
encourage and solace his men. Just then his fabaqchi,*
hearing his voice, cried: ‘They are attacking me.’ The
mirza, hearing this, dismounted and said: ‘Friends, it is
far from brave to give no help when my servant is at the
point of the sword.’ He himself went down into the
trench but not one of his followers dismounted. Twice
he sallied from the trenches, and in this endeavour became
a martyr.

in his thirty-third year.

merciless sword had touched my heart and eyes, or Sa adat-

regrets! Alas! a thousand times alas! (80d)

HeEmiIsTIcH.
O well-a-day! O well-a-day! O well-a-day!
. My sun is sunk behind a cloud.
. All may be said in a word: Mirza Hindal gave his life
freely for his sovereign.

Mir Baba Dost lifted him up and carried him to his
quarters. He told no one, and fetched servants and placed
them at the entrance and gave orders: ‘ Tell everyone who
asks, that the mirza is badly wounded and that the
Emperor forbids anyone to enter.’

Then he went and said to his Majesty: ‘ Mirza Hindal is
wounded.’ The Emperor called for a horse; ‘I will go
and see him.’ Mir ‘Abdu-l-hai said: ‘He is badly hurt.
It is not desirable that you should go.’ He understood,
and however much he tried, he could not help it, he
broke down.

Jui-shahi? was Khizr Khwaja Khan’s jagir. The
Emperor sent for him and said: ‘Take Mirza Hindal to
Jui-shahi and care for his burial.’ The khan took the
camel’s bridle,? and when he was going away with weeping
and lament and voice uplifted in grief, (81a) his Majesty
heard of the mourning and sent him word: ‘We must
have patience! This sorrow touches my heart more closely
than yours, but I do not give way because I think of our
bloodthirsty, tyrannical foe. With him at hand, there is
no help but patience. Then the khan with a hundred
regrets, miserable and stricken, conveyed the body to Jui-
shahi, and there laid and left it.

monster, Mirzé Kamran had not come that night, this
calamity would not have descended from the heavens. ,

His Majesty sent letters to his sisters in Kabul, and the
city at once became like one house of mourning. Doors
and walls wept and bewailed the death of the happy,
martyred mirza.

Gul-chihra Begam had gone to Qara Khan’s house.
When she came back, it was like the day of resurrection.
Through weeping and sorrow she fell quite ill and went out
of her mind.

It was by Mirza Kamran’s evil fate that Mirza Hindal
became a martyr. From that time forth we never heard
that his affairs prospered. On the contrary, they waned
day by day and came to naught and perished. (sib) He
set his face to evil in such fashion that fortune never
befriended him again nor gave him happiness. It was as
though Mirza Hindal had been the life, or rather the light-
giving eye of Mirza Kamran, for after that same defeat he
fled straight away to Salim Shah, the son of Shir Khan.
Salim Shah gave him a thousand rupis.2 Then the mirza
told in what position he was, and asked help. Salim Shah
said nothing openly in reply, but in private he remarked :
‘How can a man be helped who killed his own brother,
Mirza Hindal? It is best to destroy him and bring him to
naught.’ Mirza Kamran heard of this opinion and one
night, without even consulting his people, he resolved on
flight and got away, and his own men had not even a word
of it. They stayed behind and when news of the flight
reached Salim Shah, he imprisoned many of them.

Mirza Kamran had gone as far as Bhira and Khush-ab
when Adam Ghakkar, by plot and stratagems, captured
him and brought him to the Emperor. (82a)

To be brief, all the assembled khans and sultans, and
high and low, and plebeian and noble, and soldiers and the

rest who all bore the mark of Mirza Kamran’s hand, with

one voice represented to his Majesty: ‘Brotherly custom

has nothing to do with ruling and reigning. If you wish

to act as a brother, abandon the throne. If you wish to be ——_
king, put aside brotherly sentiment. What kind of wound
was it that befell your blessed head in the Qibchaq defile
through this same Mirzi Kamran? He it was whose -
traitorous and crafty conspiracy with the Afghans killed

Mirza Hindal. Many a Chaghatai has perished through

him ; women and children have been made captive and

lost honour. It is impossible that our wives and children ©
should suffer in the future the thrall and torture of
captivity. (82b) With the fear of hell before our eyes' (we

say that) our lives, our goods, our wives, our children are

all a sacrifice for a single hair of your Majesty’s head.

This is no brother! This is your Majesty’s foe !’

To make an end of words, one and all urgently set forth :
‘It is well to lower the head of the breacher of a kingdom.’

His Majesty answered: ‘Though my head inclines to
your words, my heart does not.’ All cried out: ‘ What has
been set before your Majesty is the really advisable course.’
At last the Emperor said: ‘If you all counsel this and
agree to it, gather together and attest it in writing.’ All
the amirs both of the right and left assembled. They
wrote down and gave in that same line (misra’) : ‘ It is well
to lower the head of the breacher of the kingdom.’ Even
his Majesty was compelled to agree.

When he drew near to Rohtas, the Emperor gave an
order to Sayyid Muhammad: ‘Blind Mirza Kamran in
both eyes.’ The sayyid went at once and did so.

After the blinding, his Majesty the Emperor? ... .

APPENDIX A.

Brograpuican Notices oF THE WoMEN MENTIONED BY
BAzsar, GuL-BADAN, AND Harpar.!

I. Afaq (Apaq) Begam.

Princess of the Universe ; Ar. @faq, four quarters,
universe, etc..

She is mentioned, without clue to her parentage,
by Babar, as a wife of Sultan Husain Mirza Baygra.
He mentions her again, with others of the mirza’s
widows, a8 seen in Harat in 912H. (1506-7), and here
his wording, both in the Turki and the Persian texts,
allows the inference that she is a daughter of Sultan
Abt-sa'id Miran-shaht. Mr. Erskine translates the
‘passage thus: ‘Payanda Sultan Begam, my father’s
sister, Khadija Begam and the other (Turki, yena;.
Pers., digar) daughters of Sultan Abu-sa‘id Mirza.’

When greeting the ladies, Babar gave Afaq prece-
dence over Khadija, and notes the fact. Khadija was
not a woman of birth.

Husain Bayqrad married three daughters of Abu-
said, Shahr-bani, Payanda, and Afaq. The last bore
him no child, but she reared and educated nine chil-
dren of his by her own foster-sister, Baba dghacha.

Early in 932H. (1525) she went from Harat to
Kabul and was received by Babar (before his depar-
ture for India in November, 1525) with all possible
respect and kindness. He gives the impression that

she was an affectionate and devoted woman, and says
that her tender care of her husband in illness sur-

_. News of her death reached Babar when he was
besieging Chandiri in 984H. (January, 1528).

II. Afaq Begam. (No. 26.)!

She was a daughter of Sultan-bakht Begam; her
father’s name has not yet come to my knowledge; she
was a grand-daughter of Sultan Abu-sa'id Mirza.

Babar mentions the arrival of a daughter of Sultan-
bakht Begam in Agra in 985H. (October, 1528), and
Gul-badan supplies the name Afaq by naming an
Afaq of this parentage as at the Mystic Feast in
938H. (15381).

v. Agha Begam Baygqra.

She was a daughter of Sultan Husain Mirza Bayqra
and of Payanda Sultén Begam Miran-shahi. Her
descent being so high through both parents, her name
Agha rises above its frequent application to wives of -
less degree. Here it may have the meaning of chief or
great. She married her cousin Murad who was a son
of Rabi‘a-sultan Begam (Bedka): The Habtbu-s-siyar,
827 et seq. (lith. ed.), states that she died before she
reached maturity, but this does not agree with Babar’s
statements. The Habib places her death earlier than
912H. (1506).

VII. Agha-sultan aghacha. (No. 87.)

(?) The lady of chief honour.

She was a wife of ‘Umar Shaikh Mirza (died 1494),
and mother of Yadgar Sultan Begam (Babar’s half-
sister). She was present at Hindal’s marriage feast
(1587), and probably at the Mystic Feast, in 1581.
She is classed amongst ‘ our begams.’

VIII. Agha-sultan Sultanam Dughlat.

She was a daughter of Muhammad Haidar Mirza
Dughlat, and therefore aunt of the author of the
Tarikh-i-rashidt. She married ‘Abdu-l-qadus Beg
Dughlat in Kashghar, after 877H. (1472-73). Her
husband was alive in 900H. (1494-95), and was gover-
nor of Khost for Sultan Mahmud Mirza Miran-shahi.

IX. Ai Begam Miran-shahi. . ry,

Turki, @, moon. Her name is not mentioned in

the Memoirs, but is so by Ilminsky (Mems., 30; -

Iiminsky, 34, line 7 from foot).

She was the fourth daughter of Sultan Mahmud
Mirza Mtrdnshahi and Khanzada Termizi I].; and wife
of Jahangir Mirza, half-brother of Babar. She was
betrothed in 901H. (1495-96), married in 910H.
(1504-5), bore one daughter, and was widowed not
later than 914H.°(1508-9).

Pavet de Courteille, I. 57, 262.

X. Aka Begam Baygqrda.

Aka is clearly a title; her personal name I have
not found. Her sister who is styled Bedka, appears
to be named Rabi‘a-sultan.

Daughter of Mansur Mirza Bayqrd and Firoza Begam
Miran-shahi, full and elder sister of Sultan Husain
Mirza. Babar states (Mems., 176, 177) that she
married (his uncle) Sultan Ahmad Mirza, and had a
son, Kichak Mirza (the young or small prince). But
he does not mention her, either as Aka or otherwise,
amongst Ahmad’s wives (Mems., 22), and he says that
Ahmad had two sons who died young. Kichak, how-
ever, lived to change his military occupations for
literature.

It is singular that a marriage of the oldest Miran-
shahi of his generation with the oldest Baygra girl
should not have been entered in Ahmad’s biographical
notice.

XII. Aq Begam Baygra.

Turki, dq, fair. The word is frequently a sobri-
quet and the bearer’s personal name is occasionally
known; ¢.g., Yasin-daulat, Aq Sultan ; Saliqa Begam,
Aq Begam. But frequently the personal name is not
traceable.

Daughter of Sultan Husain Mirza Bayqra and _
Payanda Sultan Begam Miran-shahi; first cousin of
Babar; wife of Muhammad Qasim Arlat.1 She had
one daughter, known as the Black-eyed (qard-guz)
Begam.

Mems., 181.

XIII. Aq Begam Mirdn-shahit. (No. 8.)

Aq Begam was a daughter of Abi-sa id Miran-shahi
and Khadija. She was one of the several paternal
aunts of Babar who went to India at his invitation.
She reached Agra in October, 1528 (Safar, 985H.),
and was met by her nephew. She was present at the
double wedding of Gul-rang and Gul-chihra in 1530
(937H.), and was probably at Babar’s death-bed. She
was at the Mystic Feast on December 19th, 1531
(Jumada I. 9th, 988H.).

Gul-badan, lla, 18b, 20a, 240.
Mems., 179, 182, 387.

XIV. Aq Begam Miran-shahi.

Third daughter of Sultan Mahmud Mirza Miran-
shaht and Khanzada Begam Termizi; and first cousin
of Babar. The Memoirs do not mention her marriage
or (as usual alternative) early death. She was full
sister of a wife of Babar, Zainab.

Mems., 30.

XV. ‘Aqiqa (Afifa) Begam Miran-shahi. (No. 47.)

Her name may be ‘Aqiqa, a cornelian, etc., or
‘Afifa, a chaste, modest woman. Our begam’s MS.
allows both readings. I have used the first but the
second seems the more appropriate in sense.

She was a daughter of Humayin and Bega and
second child of both parents. She was born in Agra
in 1531. It is only from her aunt Gul-badan that

‘anything is known of her. She went to Gualiar with
her mother in (?) 1584; she was at Hindal’s feast in
1587, and she was lost at Chausa on June 27th, 15389.

Gul-badan, 22a, 236, 25, 33b, 346. _ e

XVI. Atin mama. (No. 88.)

An atin is a teacher of reading, writing, and em-
broidery, etc. Mémd seems to be the title of old
women-servants.

Babar mentions an atin in 1501. He met her at
Pashaghar whither she had come on foot from Samar-
qand and where she again joined her old mistress,
Babar’s mother, Qutluq-nigar Khanam. She had been
left behind in the city after Shaibani’s capture of it
because there was no horse for her to ride.

Gul-badan mentions an atin mama as at Hindal’s
wedding feast, and as mama seems to be used for old
servants, it is possible that she is the woman men-
tioned by Babar.

Mems., 99.

XVII. ‘Ayisha-sultan Begam Bayqra. (No. 9.)

Ar. ‘aish, joy, and sultin, sway, pre-eminence. Cf.
App. s.n. Daulat.

Daughter of Sultan Husain Mirza Baygra and
Yobaida dghacha of the Shaiban sultans. ‘Ayisha
married, (1) Qasim Sultan Uzbeg, a Shaiban sultan,

-and by him became the mother of Qasim Husain
Sultan Uzbeg, an amir of Babar and Humayun;
(2) by yanga-lik (cf. App. s.n. Jamal), Buran Sultan,

a kinsman of Qasim Sultan, and by whom she had
“Abdu-l-lah Sultan Uzbeg who entered Babar’s service.

‘Ayisha was at the Mystic Feast in 1581, and she
was lost at Chausa in 1589 (946H.).

Khwand-amir gives 929H. (1522-23) as a date aft >
which ‘Ayisha was in Qasim Sultan’s haram, but this
does not agree with Babar’s narrative. His entry that

~ “‘Abdu-l-lah was in his service and although young,
acquitting himself respectably, cannot at latest have
been made after 1580. From 1522 to 1530 is all too
short for widowhood, remarriage, birth of “Abdu-l-lah,
and his growth to respectable military service.

Gul-badan, 246, 330.

Mems., 182.
Habibu-s-siydr, lith. ed., 327 et seq..

XVIII. ‘Ayisha-sultan Begam Miran-shahi. (? No. 11.)

Third daughter of Sultan Ahmad Mirza Mirdan-
shahi and Quttiq (Katak) Begam. She was a first
cousin of Babar, and his first wife. They were
betrothed in Samarqand when he was five years old,
894H.(1488-89), and married in Shaban, 905H.
(March, 1500), at Khojand during the ‘troubles’
4.€., conflict with Khusrau Shah and Ahmad Tambol.
Babar says that at first he had no small affection for
“Ayisha and that it declined. She was the mother of
his first child, Fakhru-n-nisa (born 907H., 1501).
She left Babar before the overthrow (wirdnt) of Tash-
kand by Shaibani in 909H. (1503), being influenced
by the ‘machinations’ of her elder sister, probably
Saliqa, who was married to one of those many kins-
men who tried to overthrow the boy-king of Farghana.

Gul-badan mentions an ‘Ayisha Sultan Begam
(No. 11) as being at the Mystic Feast, without de-
scribing her. The following entry (No. 12) is that of
Sultani, a daughter of Sultan Ahmad Mirza, and
described as being such. It seems likely that Gul-

badan meant this note as to parentage to apply to both
begams (Nos. 11 and 12). (Cf. App. s.n. Sultanan.)

Gul-badan, 6b, 246.
Mems., 22, 78, 90.

XIX. Ayisha-sultin Begam Miran-shahi.

Daughter of Kamran Mirza.

Firishta (lith. ed., 241) and Khafi Khan (I. 122) say
that Kamran left one son and three daughters.

The son is called Ibrahim by Gul-badan, and in the
early part of the Akbar-nama. (Bib. Ind., ed., I. 226.)
Later the A. N. and other sources call him Abu’l-qasim,
which may be a hyonymic (kunyat).

As to the three girls, Firishta, without naming them,
gives the information that:

No. 1 married (a) Ibrahim Husain Mirza (Bayqra).

No.2  ,, — (b) Mirza ‘Abdu-r-rahman Mughal.

No. 3 ” (c) Fakhru-d-din Mashhadi who died
in 986H. or 987H. (No. 88 of Blochmann’s list. Ain-i-
akbari, p. 406).

Khafi Khan’s information coincides with Firishta’s
verbally as to No. 8, and actually as to No. 1 and
No. 2. For Ibrahim can be described as a son of a
‘paternal uncle,’ if these words are used in the wide
sense given to them by contemporary writers. So, too,
can ‘Abdu-r-rahman, if he be No. 188 of Blochmann’s
list—a Dughlat Mughal and cousin of Mirza Haidar.

If we take the girls’ names from other sources we
can (conjecturally in part) fill up the table.

1. Gul-rukh is known in history as the wife of
Ibrahim Husain Mirza Baygra.

2. Kamran’s eldest daughter, Habiba, was forcibly
parted from her husband, Aq Sultan, in about 1551-52,
and this would allow re-marriage to (b) or (e). Aq
Sultan went to Makka from Sind 1551-52 (cir.), and
his name disappears thenceforth.

8. ‘Ayisha may also have married () or (c).

In the list of the pilgrims of 983H. (A. N. Bib. Ind.

ed., III. 145) are included ‘ Hajiand Gul-‘izar, farzand-
an of Mirzi Kamran.’! We have already the three
names required by Firishta and Khafi Khan, ie.,
Gul-rukh, Habiba and ‘Ayisha. Gul-‘izar is ‘ super-
fluous.’ Perhaps farzandan may be read ‘ offspring,
and she may be a granddaughter. Or Habiba or
‘Ayisha may have predeceased Kamran, and for this
reason three girls only be specified by historians who
wrote of the time of his death.

Which one of the daughters was the Haji Begam of
983H. is not clear.2 It would seem that this was her
second pilgrimage, since she is enrolled as Haji before
starting. Kamran’s daughters may have gone—one
or all—to Makka after his blinding and during the
four years of his life there. Of the three, Gul-rukh is
the only one of whom it is on record that she was
widowed in 983H., and therefore quite free to make
the Haj. Ibrahim Husain died in 981H. (1578).

Haji Begam was visited by Akbar and she died in
991H. (1583).

‘Ayisha-sultan Khanam and Khatim, Mughal Khanam,
Chaghatat Mughal.

Daughter. of Sultan Mahmtd Khan. In 909H.
(1508) she, together with other ladies of her father’s
household, was captured by Shaibani and was married
by him. She bore him a son, Muhammad-rahim
Sultan. She wrote Turki verses, and her name

Mr. Beveridge tells me that a MS. Akbar-nama belonging to the
S. has wa (and) before farzandan, but it does not seem practicable

to read this.

Professor Blochmann (Ain, p. 465, No. 187) has (by a slip of

reference numbering) confused Haji Begam, daughter of Kamran, with
Haji Begam, Bega Begam, widow of Humayin. The latter died in
989H. before Gul-badan’s party returned. Bega Begam went to
Makka in 972H.. —

appears in the biography of poetesses by Fakhri amir.
Mirzaé Haidar says that some of her children and
of two other Mughal khanams (Daulat and Qut-liq)
who were forcibly married at the same time, were
living and reigning in Transoxiana at the time of his
writing the Tarikh-i-rashidt. She is, I think, the
‘Ayisha named by Gul-badan on 76b.

XXI. Baba agha (Mama agha).

Professor Blochmann writes the name Babi; but
Baba, darling, or Bani, lady, would seem more
appropriate for a Persian woman.

She was the wife of Shihabu-d-din Ahmad Khan
Nishapiri, and was related to Hamida-banu Begam
Jami, Akbar’s mother. Abi’l-fazl calls her Mama
agha. He says that she was a good woman, and that
on her death Akbar went to her house and offered
condolence because of her relationship to his mother.

Shibabu-d-din was damad of Maham anaga, and as
damad is presumably used here in its more common
sense of ‘son-in-law,’ Babu adgha@ would seem to be a
daughter of Maham anaga.

XXII. Bachaka Khalifa.

Gul-badan, Bachaka; Mems., Bachaka; Ilminsky,
Bichké. Vambéry (Chaghataische Sprachstudien)
has an appropriate word, bechek, Chok. (? Kokand),
zierrath ; ornament. The name is presumably
Chaghatai Turki, as the bearer of it was an old
family servant of a Farghana household.

Bachaka was a head woman-servant (khalifa) of
Babar’s household, and was one of two women who
escaped with his mother and him from Samarqand
in 1501. There was a Bachaka whom Gul-badan
calls a ‘khalifa of my royal father,’ lost at Chausa

same woman.

XXIII. Badi‘u-l-jamal Khanam Chaghatat Mughal.

The khanam of rare beauty; Ar. badi', astonishing,
rare ; jamal, beauty.

Daughter of Said Khan Chaghatat Mughal, ruler of
Kashghar; and first cousin, once removed, of Babar.
She married Baush Sultan of the Uzbeg Kazaks. On
her father’s death, her brother Rashid insisted upon
her divorce, and then gave her in marriage to Muham-
madi Barlads whom Haidar Mirza styles ‘a peasant.’

XXIV. Badi‘u-l-jamal Begam Miran-shahi. (No. 2.)

She was a daughter of Sultan Abia-said Mirza
Miran-shahz. She went to India during Babar’s life ;
was at the double wedding of his daughters, and at
the Mystic Feast in 1531.

She was the elder daughter of Sultan Husain Mirza
Bayqra and Mingli-bi aghacha Uzbeg. She married
Sayyid ‘Abdu-l-lah Mirza of Andikhud (a Timurid

who served Babar.

XXVI. Bakhshi-banu Begam.
Princess Good-fortune. Pers. bakhsh, fortune, and
bani (van), possessing.

She was a daughter of Humayun and of Ginwar
Bibi, and was born in Jumada I., 947H. (September,
1540), the year of the Timurid exodus from India. She
fell into the hands of her uncle ‘Askari with her father’s
camp and the baby Akbar in 1543. In 1545 she was
sent with Akbar in the depth of winter from Qandahar
to Kabul. In 957H. (1550), and when ten years old,
she was betrothed by her father to Ibrahim, son of
Sulaiman and Haram. Ibrahim (b. 1534) was six years
older than Bakhshi-bant, and he was killed in 1560,
leaving her a widow of twenty. In the same year
she was given in marriage by Akbar to Mirza Sharafu-
d-din Husain Ahrari.

Gul-badan, 396.
Akbar-nama, 8.n..

XXVII. Bakhtu-n-nisa’ Begam.

Felicity of womanhood; Pers. bakht, felicity, for-
tune, and nisd', woman.

She was a daughter of Humayin and Mah-chtchak,
and was born in 957H. (1550). Gul-badan says that
she received her name in accordance with Humaytn’s
interpretation of adream. There is, however, ground
for thinking that she and Fakhru-n-nisa’, both men-
tioned in the histories as daughters of Mah-chuchak,
are one and the same person. Gul-badan enumerates
three daughters of Mah-chuchak, and says that there
were four. It is her habit to state, in such matters,
one more than she names. She mentions Bakht, but
not Fakhr. ,

Of Bakhtu-n-nisa’ it is recorded in the histories
that she came from Kabul to India with her son
Diwali, after the death of Mirzi Muhammad Hakim,
her brother (993H.—1584-85), and that she was con-
cerned in a reconciliation effected by Salima-sultan
Begam between Akbar and Salim.

: Mirza of Haji Tarkhan who was her first cousin and
- the son of Rabi‘a-sultan (Bedka) Baygqra.

lana.’ This may be a second marriage or a confusion
with Kichak, her sister.

XXXII. Bega Begam and Bibi.

The Emperor Jahangir, when in his Memoirs
enumerating the gardens of Kabul, mentions one
which belonged to Bega Begam, a widow of his father’s
grandfather, t.¢., Babar. Which of Babar’s wives is
indicated by this title cannot be said with certainty.

Jauhar has a story of Kamran’s want of considera-
tion for ‘Bega Begam,’ in which the points useful
here are that on the day in 1545 when Humayun
took Kabul from Kamran, he asked for food from
Bega Begam, and he said of her that she was the
very person who had brought Babar’s bones and laid
them in Kabul.

These two references of Jahangir and Jauhar are
probably to the same lady. Of Babar’s wives, Bibi
Mubarika (Afghani dghdcha) appears to me the most
suitable to the time and task.

Babar’s body was still in its Agra tomb in 1539.
(Gul-badan, 34b.) Maham was then dead; Dil-dar’s
movements exclude her from consideration ; Gul-rukh,
if living, will have left Agra with her son Kamran

' before the Timurid exodus was enforced by defeat at
Kanauj; Bibi Mubarika remains, the probable and
appropriate agent for fulfilling Babar’s wish as to the
final disposition of his body. She lived into Akbar’s
reign, and her character and respected position in the
household add to the sum of probability that she
would discharge this duty.

Babar’s body was not removed till after the fitrat,
i.e., the Timurid downfall and exodus. Bega Begam,

or, as we may call her with Jauhar for the sake of
clearness, the Bibi, must therefore have remained
behind the rest of the royal family. This may have ©
occurred in one of two natural ways. She might have
stayed in Agra under the protection of one of the
religious families and safeguarded by pious duty to
Babar’s tomb, until Shir Khan gave permission to
remove the body and a safe escort for her journey to
his frontier ; or she may even have been in Bengal
and at Chausa with Humayun, and, like Bega (Haji)
Begam, have been made captive. It would harmonize
with Shir Khan’s known actions if he had allowed
Babar’s widow to remove his bones, and if he had
aided her pious task.

XXXIII. Bega Begam Miran-shaht. (No. 15.)

This Bega was a daughter of Mirza Ulugh Beg
Miran-shahi who was king of Kabul and known as
‘abulz. She was Babar’s first cousin, and may be
that daughter of her father who married Muhammad
Masum Mirza Baygra. Gul-badan styles her ‘ama,
paternal aunt, of Humayin ; anglice, she and he were
first cousins, once removed. She was at the Mystic
Feast in December, 1531.

and in which she was. Husain became apprehensive
about the spring rains and patched up a peace, the
seal of which was Bega’s marriage with his son
Haidar, her first cousin through his mother, Payanda-
sultan. The betrothal took place outside the fort, with
assistance of such music as could be procured, and later
when the bride was taken to Harat, the marriage was
celebrated with the splendour loved by Husain and
- befitting a Timurid alliance. Haidar was a full
Timirid; Bega was one on her father’s side, and
probably as a Termizi sayyida’s daughter, drew through
her also a strain of the same blood.
Haidar died before his father; i.e., before 912H.
(April, 1506).

Gul-badan, (?) 246, No. 22. : ~~

XXXV. Bega (Hajz) Begam (?) Begchik Mughal. (? No. 50.)
She was a daughter of Uncle (faghat) Yadgar Beg
who was, I think, a brother of Sultan ‘Ali Mirza,
father of Kamran’s wife, Gul-rukh. Abiu‘l-fazl calls
Bega Begam dukhtar-i-taghai-i-walida-i-Jannat-ashyant.
‘Yadgar and ‘Ali Begchik are both styled Mirza, but
this elevation is due, it sesms, to their alliances with

the royal house. Haidar calls their brothers mers.

Bega married Humayin, her first cousin, and she
was the wife of his youth. It is out of harmony with
the custom of his house that his chief wife should be
of less than royal descent. So far as I have been able
to trace the matter, he never made an equal marriage.
Gul-barg Barlds, ‘ Khalifa’s’ daughter, whose second
husband he was, had best claim to high birth.

The first son, perhaps first child, of Bega and
Humayin was Al-aman, born 934H. or 935H. (1528)
when his father was about twenty-one and was in
Badakhshan. Babar has commemorated his birth
both by mentioning it and by preserving his own

congratulatory letter to the young father. Al-aman
died in infancy.

Bega came to India after Babar’s death (December,
1530), and her second and last-mentioned child, ‘Afifa—
(‘Aqiqa) was born in 1581.

In 1584 (circa) Gul-badan’s story (290, 300) shows
Bega as resenting neglect by Humaytin who accepts
invitations to his sisters’ quarters in camp in prefer-
ence to hers and Gul-barg’s. Some impressions of
this story make one question whether the Bega it tells
of is Humayun’s wife or another. But the circum-
stances that she is associated with a wife, Gul-barg ;
that Gul-badan does not speak of her as being
other than the ‘ Bega Begam’ of the home circle;
Humayun’s allusions to the elder kinswomen; and
the absence of the deference customary to an elder
woman, seem sufficient justification for identifying the
complaining Bega with the wife. (Gul-badan, it may
be observed, mentions one other Bega Begam—i.e.,
Mirdn-shahi, daughter of Ulugh Beg Kabuli.)

Bega was with Humayun during the idleness of his
decadence in Bengal, and with her was her sister, the
wife of Zahid Beg. Zahid offended Humaytn, and
Bega tried in vain to obtain his forgiveness.

She was captured at Chausa by Shir Khan, and
here she lost her little girl, ‘Aqiqa. The historians
all call her Hajz Begam in recording her capture ; it
is only Gul-badan who calls her Bega Begam. She
was returned in safety to Humayin under the escort of
Shir Khan’s best general, Khawas Khan. How soon
she was returned I am not able to say. Support
is to be found for the view that she was sent to
Agra directly after Humayiin’s arrival there, and also
for the view that she was not returned to him until
after a considerable time had elapsed. I do not know
whether she went to Sind with the exiles or was sent
later direct to Kabul. She was in Kabul with the
royal family after 1545. She remained there with the

other ladies when Humayin made his expedition to
recover Hindustan, and she came with Hamida, Gul-
badan, and the rest to join Akbar in 964H. (1557).
After this she built her husband’s tomb near Dihli,
and became its faithful attendant.

Akbar is said to have been much attached to her,
and she was to him like a second mother. She went
to Makka in 972H. (1564-65), and returned three years
later. One thing raises the question whether this
was her first pilgrimage, viz., the fact that all the
sources, except Gul-badan’s, call her Hajz Begam.
Why is she singled out to bear this title? It had
been earned by many royal ladies before any one of
the trio of great writers under Akbar had put pen to
paper. The same unexplained distinction is conferred
by the histories on a daughter of Kamran. In both
these cases a renewed pilgrimage might serve as the
explanation of the distinction.

Bega Begam died in 989H. (1581), shortly before
Gul-badan’s return from Makka. She had almost
certainly passed her seventieth year, and was perhaps
still older. Abuw’l-fazl says that her affairs were
settled by one Qasim ‘Ali Khan. He also records a
visit of Akbar to her in her last illness, as well as an
earlier visit of hers to him made from Dihli in 981H..

and fretted the mirza beyond endurance, till, driven
to extremities by her insufferable humour, he divorced

XLII. Chili Begam Azak.

The Desert Princess; Pers. chil, desert. The

(which looks like a sobriquet) suits the descent of
the begam better than anything which can be
extracted from jul. Ilminsky writes Juli, but for
this the Mems. are his possible warrant. B.M. Pers.
Or. 16,628, f. 123, 1. 7., has a clearly-pointed chili ;
also on f. 1246.

Chili (Juli) Begam was a daughter of a beg of the
Azaks, and married Sultan Husain Bayqra before he
conquered Khurasin in 878H. (1473). She was the
mother of Sultanam, his eldest girl and her only
child, and she died before 912H. (1506).

She was clearly an active and working member of

begams when they visited the waterfall at Farza, and
saw to the commissariat. She is named as being at
Hindal’s marriage feast.

XLV. Daulat-kitta (?) Arghin.

Kitta I find only as a Turki word, meaning noble,
powerful. With it the name would be a mongrel
of Arabic and Turki. Perhaps Daulat-giti might
be read.

She was a servant in Mirza Muhammad Muqim
Arghin’s house, and was an intermediary in effect-
ing the elopement of her master’s daughter, Mah-
chichak Arghin, from Kabul. Mr. Erskine tells the
story admirably.

Good-fortune itself; the very image of felicity.
Ar. daulat, and Pers. nigar, effigy, image.

Daughter of Isin-bigha Khan Chaghatai; wife of
Muhammad Haidar Mirza Dughlat.

Tar. Rash., E. & B., 88.

XLVII. Daulat-sultan Khanam Chaghatat Mughal.

Ar. daulat, fortune, and sulfién, sway. In many
proper names, sultan does not appear to be a title,
but rather to indicate the sway or dominance of the
quality imputed by the first word of the name;
eg., Latif-sultan, Daulat-sultén. In giving these
names, one might suppose the prophetic notion to be
that the first child should be a regnant delight and
the second a prevailing felicity.

Youngest child of Yunas Khan Chaghatai and Shah
Begam Badakhsht ; half-sister of Babar’s mother ; wife
by chance of battle, of Timtr Sultan Uzbeg; mother
by him of a daughter.

In 907H. (1501-2) she was in Tashkand, and Qut-liq-
nigar Khanam went to visit her after thirteen or four-
teen years of separation. Babar, dejected and an exile,
joined the family party in the next year. In 909H.
(1508) Shaibani sacked Tashkand and forcibly married

Daulat-sultan to his son Timur. “She bore him a
daughter, and she remained in his faram until Babar
took possession of Samarqand in 917H. (1511), and
_she joined him. She went south with him in 1513,
' and remained several years in Badakhshan with
another nephew, Mirza (Wais) Khan who behaved to
her like a son.

Another nephew, Said, her own brother Ahmad’s
son, then invited her, with costly gifts, to visit him in
Kashghar. She made the long and difficult journey ;
joined him in Yarkand; and with him she spent the
rest of her life.

Babar mentions that her foster-brother brought him
news and letters from her in 925H. (September 8th,
1519). In the same year Mansiar, Sa'id’s eldest brother,
went to Kashghar to visit her, his ‘ beloved aunt.’

The Persian text of the Tarikh-i-rashidi says that
Mansir went so that by looking at her kind face his
grief for the loss of his father might be mitigated. The
Bible Society’s Turki version reads: ‘Being prompted

_ thereto by the extreme warmth of his affection for her.’
Both statements illumine her character. The second
seems the more appropriate, since the death of Sultan
Ahmad Khan took place in 909H. (1508) and Mansur’s
visit in 926H. (1520).

There is no mention of her remarriage, and her
story is that of an affectionate and leisured aunt.

XLIX. Dil-dar Begam. (No. 48.)
The Heart-holding Princess; Pers. dil, heart, and
dar, holding.

Neither her husband, Babar nor her daughter, Gul- |
badan gives any clue to her parentage. Her marriage
is not spoken of in the Memoirs; it, as well as Gul-
rukh’s, probably occurred in the missing decade of
1509-19. If Babar held the view that four wives were
a lawful number, Dil-dar, of whatever parentage, may
be counted amongst them, since in 1509 Maham only
remained of his earlier wives, ‘Ayisha, Zainab, and
Ma'sima having disappeared from the household by
death or divorce.

Dil-dar is mentioned once in the Turki text of Kehr
and Ilminsky, and then as dghdcha. I am too ignorant
of the import of this word in the domestic circle to
venture to draw from its use an inference as to social
status. It, however, as used by Babar and by Gul-
badan, supports Pavet de Courteille’s definition of a
‘lady ’ in contradistinction to a ‘ begam,’ and does not
convey reproach to the woman as its occasional English
rendering (concubine) does.

The Akbar-nama (Bib. Ind. ed., Il. 62) makes use of
the words ‘ Dil-dar dghacha Begam,’ and adds dghd as a
variant (cf. App., 8.2. @gha@). Gul-badan always styles
her mother begam, and sometimes hazrat. In enumer-
ating her father’s children and their mothers, she
does not mention the parentage of any wife besides
Ma'sima Miran-shahi, a Timirid, but no deduction as
to the lower birth of the others can be drawn safely
from this, and there is some ground for supposing that
Dil-dar was of Mirdn-shahi birth. (Cf. infra, p. 277.)

Perhaps some indication of non-royal birth is given
by Maham’s forcible adoption of Dil-dar’s son in 1519,
but I am too ignorant of the nuances of Muhammadan
etiquette to venture on assertion or even on opinion
in such a matter. That Maham did not take Gul-

15

rukh’s! son tells nothing, since the chief factors in the
adoption, i.e., Maham’s loss of her own children and
wish to adopt, may have become operative only when
they were put into practice in 1519.

Five children of Dil-dar are mentioned by Gul-
badan: Gul-rang, born between 1511 and 1515; Gul-
chihra; Abi-n-nasir Muhammad (Hindal), born 1519 ;
Gul-badan, born 1528 ; and Alwar, who died in India
in 1529.

She is very frequently written of by her daughter ;
some other authors give of her a clear and pleasant
impression; and she is always spoken of with respect
and as a good and sensible woman.

She went to India in 1526, the first year of Babar’s

LVI. - Fatima Sultan dghd.

Ar. Fatima, a name given presumably in honour of

the Prophet’s daughter. The meaning of sultan

here is not apparent. It does not seem as, e.g., in
Daulat-sultdan, safe to consider it as a part of a com-

pound word, and to read Fatima-sultan. Nor from

the bearer’s parentage does it suit to take it as a

‘title, implying that she is of the sultans of her tribe.

There are points in the use of the word sultan which

require fuller discussion than is practicable here.

One Fatima Sultan and her sister Bairam (Maryam)

were the children of Husain Bayqra by an Uzbeg

servant of one of his royal wives. They are not

given any further title, but their brothers are mirzds.

Daughter of the chief of a Mughal tuman (10,000
men); first wife of ‘Umar Shaikh Muran-shahi;
mother of his second son, Jahangir who was two

years the junior of Babar.
Mems., 10, 14.

Mother of Raushan kiika and of Zuhra, wife of

the drdi-begi of Humayun’s haram, a title which
Blochmann translates ‘armed woman.’

She was at Hindal’s marriage feast; she helped to
‘nurse Humayun in 1546; and was an envoy to Haram
Begam for marriage negotiations; and she appears
in Akbar’s reign when her daughter is murdered.

be the child of that Sultanam who received Gul-badan
at Kul-jalali. (14a) She married, first, Mir Shah
Husain Arghtin, in 980H. (1524). The alliance was
not happy and a separation took place. She appears
to have remarried Humayun at some time before the
defeat at Chausa (1539). She was with him subse-
quently in Sind, and from there went with Sultanam
to Makka previous to 1543.

She was buried in Dihli. Mir Ma‘sam writes of
her death: ‘She entrusted her soul to the guardians
of the hour of death, and the leaves (gul-barg) of the

Daughter of Babar and Dil-dar; their second child,

of Gul-rang, Hindal, and Gul-badan.

She married Babar’s first cousin (@ son of his
mother’s brother Ahmad), Sultan Tukhta-bugha Khan
Chaghatat Mughal. The marriage was arranged by
Babar, and took place in 937H. (end of 1530). She
would then be about fourteen years old.

She was widowed cir. 940H. (1533), and nothing
as to her remarriage is recorded until 956H. (1549),
when she was over thirty years old. It is improbable
that she remained a widow so many years. (Cf. App.
s.n. Salima-sultan.) In 956H. she entered upon what
looks like a mariage de raison with ‘Abbas Sultan
Uzbeg, just before Humayin set out on his expedition
for Balkh. The bridegroom came to suspect that the
Timurid army was about to act against his own people
and ran away. Probably he did not take Gul-chihra
with him. Her name next appears in the histories
when she accompanies Gul-badan and Hamida to
India in 964H. (1557).

She was of Babar’s faram, and may have been one
of the two Circassian (Cherkis) slaves (the other being
Nar-gul) who were presented to the Emperor by Shah
Tahmasp in 983H. (1526).

She was at Hindal’s wedding-feast, and shared in
the conferences of Humayun and his family; and she
was one of Gul-badan Begam’s pilgrim band (983H.,
1575).

The rose-hued princess.
Daughter of Babar and Dil-dar and her mother’s
first child. She was born in Khost, probably between
- 1511 and 1515, during Babar’s exile from Kabul after
_ the Mughal rebellion. She was given in marriage to
Isan-timur Chaghatat Mughal, her father’s first cousin,
during the last days of her father’s life and in 1530.

rang there is no certain record after cir. 1534, when
she was at Gualiar. (28a) (Cf. App. s.n. Salima.)

LXXV. Gul-rukh Begam (?) Begchik Mughal.
The rose-cheeked princess.

_ Wife of Babar; mother of Kamran, ‘Askari, Shah-
rukh, Ahmad, and Gul-‘izir. Outside Kabul there
was in 1545 the tomb of Gul-rukh Begam. (64))
This may well have been hers.

She is perhaps a Begchik. This may be judged
from the following notes : .

(1) Kamran married a daughter of Sultan ‘Ali
Mirza taghdi.1 (Mems., 388.)

(2) Humayun married a daughter of Yadgar faghaz.
(Mems., 388.)

Amongst contemporary Begchik amirs are Sultan
Ali Mirza and Yadgar Mirza.

If one follows the recorded incidents of Sultan ‘Ali’s
life, one sees that Gul-rukh may be his sister.

(a) In 914H. (1508-9) he was ordered to drown
Khalil Khan. (Tar. Rash., 183.) Having done so,
he took refuge with Babar in Samargqand. (l.c., 265.)

(b) In 917H. (1511) he was with Sayyid Muhammad
Dughlat in Andijan, apparently at Babar’s instance.
(I.c., 248.) In the same year he was sent by Said

1 This is a difficult word to deal with. It has a wider use than its
usual translation ‘mother’s brother.’ It is used for the uncle, great-
uncle, etc., in ascending line. In other words, the mother’s brother,
in at any rate distinguished families, of one generation remains the
mother’s brother, faghiii, in the next and the next. Once a faghii,
always a faghdz?. The numerous uncles on the mother’s side who
appear in the Memoirs and the Téarikh-t-rashidi as so-and-so faghi,
might be described as brothers of the mothers of a king’s or chief’s
children,

To found opinion of relationship on the unsupported use of the word
is to court disaster. Great wariness is needed. A quite perplexing
faghdai is the Machiavelli of Mirza Haidar’s life, ‘Ali Mirza faghir
(Dughlat). He is constantly on the scene, and the one fact not men-
tioned which it is desirable to know is, whose brother was he? Only
with much trouble can a surmise as to his parentage be hazarded.

Khan who had reinforced Andijan’ under Babar’s
orders, to Kazan.

(c) In 920H. (1514) he accompanied Said in his
conquest of Kashghar, and at this date is named
amongst the Begchik amirs of the Kashghar army.
(l.c., 808, 826.)

(a) In 925H. (1519) he waited on Babar, and is
styled faghait of Kamrin. (Mems., 274.) Babar says
here: ‘Sultan ‘Ali Mirza, the maternal uncle of
Kamran (Ilminsky, 311, Kamran-ninak taghai), who
in the year in which I passed over from Khost to
Kabul had proceeded to Kashghar, as has been men-
tioned,' waited on me here.’

Babar must several times have passed from Khost
(Andar-ab) to Kabul. The Tarikh-i-rashidi fixes the
occasion here alluded to as in 920H. (1514). This
was Babar’s latest and last crossing of the northern
passes to Kabul.

By thus bringing the statements of the Memoirs
and the Tartkh-i-rashidi together, Sultan ‘Ali Mirza
Begchik is fairly-well identified with Sultan ‘Ali Mirza,
taghat of Kamran.’

(e) In 985H. (1528) Kamran married his daughter.

LXXVI. Gul-rukh Begam Mirdn-shahi.

Daughter of Kamran Mirza; wife of Ibrahim
Husain Mirza Baygqra; mother of Muzaffar Husain
who married Sultan Khanam, Akbar’s eldest daughter,
and of Niru-n-nisa’ who became a wife of Salim
(the Emperor Jahangir).

1 Something interesting as to the Tiazuk-i-babart (Turki text of the
Memoirs) may lie here. The period of Sa‘id’s Kashghar conquest
falls in a gap of the Tuzuk. Babar referred to an incident of that
time as having been already mentioned. This suggests, as a cause of
the gap, lost leaves, and not an omission of record. (Cf. Tar. Rash.,
247 n..)

The story of her husband’s rebellious pursuit and
death (981H., 1578), and of her flight to the Dakhin
with her son, is found at length in the histories.

Eldest daughter of Kamran Mirza and probably

She married Yasin-daulat (the Fair Sultan) Chaghatat
Mughal, a brother of Gul-badan’s husband, Khizr, and
her own second cousin. It may be that she married a
second time after she was forcibly parted from Yasin-
daulat in 1551-52. (Cf. App. s.n. Hajt Miran-shahi.)

She was taken captive as a child by Shaibani
Uzbeg, and she lived in his household until he gave
her in marriage to his nephew, ‘Ubaidu-l-lah. Shortly
before Shaibani murdered her father (914H., 1508-9),
‘Ubaidu-l-lah asked for Haidar (tat. 11) to come to
him and Habiba in Bukhara, and thus saved him from
a general massacre of Mughal sultans.

When ‘Ubaidu-1-lah retreated to Turkistan (cir. 1511),
Habiba remained in Bukhara. She then joined her
uncle Sayyid Muhammad Dughlat, in Samarqand,
and with him went to Andijan where he married her
to her cousin Said. She reared one of Said’s chil-
dren, Rashid whose mother was a ‘tribeswoman,’
Makhdim Qdluchi, but he certainly did her training
no credit. She was widowed in 939H. (July 9th,
1533), so that Gul-badan may be wrong in saying that
she was at the Mystic Feast in 1531. She may have
been a wedding guest in 1587.

LXXXIII. Hamida-bant Begam Maryam-makani.

Posthumous style, Maryam-makdni, dwelling with
Mary.

She was the mother of Akbar. There is difficulty
in making precise statement as to her family rela-
tions. She was of the lineage of Ahmad Jami
Zinda-fil.

(a). Gul-badan, whose long intimacy with Hamida
invests her statement with authority, states that Mir
Baba Dost was Hamida’s father, and that Khwaja
Mu'azzam was her barddar, i.e., brother undefined.

(b). The Tarikh-i-sind states that her father was
Shaikh ‘Ali-akbar Jamz who was one of the pillars
of Mirza Hindal. Nizamu-d-din Ahmad says that
‘Ali-akbar was father of Mu'azzam.

If the statements of paragraphs (a) and (b) stood
alone, ‘Baba Dost’ and ‘‘Ali-akbar’ might be iden-
tified as the petit-nom and the name of one man.

There is a good deal to support this view, and there
is something against it.

In favour of the identification of Baba Dost with
‘Ali-akbar are the following points :

(1). ‘Baba Dost’ seems to be not a personal name,
but a sobriquet of affection and domestic intimacy.

(2). Jauhar calls-Hamida the daughter of Hindal’s
akhund, and Mr. Erskine (perhaps, however, infer-
entially) calls “Ali-akbar Hindal’s preceptor.

(3). Mir Baba Dost was alive in 947H. (1540-41),
the year preceding Hamida’s marriage, and was then
with Hindal. (Akbar-nama, H. Beveridge, I. 360.)

(4). Nizamu-d-din Ahmad and Baddyuni contribute
negative support to the identification by using the


--- Page 267 ---
Courtesy www.pdfbooksfree.pk

238

indefinite khal, maternal uncle, to describe the relation
of Akbar and Mu‘azzam.

(5). The Ma asiru-l-umara’ confirms the identifica-
tion by use of the words baradar-i-a'yani, full-brother.
Its authority may not be of the best, but the choice
of these words has some weight.

(6). “Ali-akbar was of the lineage of Ahmad Jami.
Humayun had a dream which allowed him to know
that the son prophesied in it by Ahmad would be of
the latter’s lineage. There is, I think, nothing said
on this point of Mir Baba Dost, but saintly descent
was claimed for Hamida’s father.

(7). Gul-badan gives one the impression (it is little
more) that Mu'azzam was younger than Hamida.
He calls his sister Mah-chicham, which may be read
as ‘Moon of my mother,’ but also as ‘Elder Moon-
sister.’ (Cf. 18) n.) If he were Hamida’s junior,
and as Mir Baba Dost was alive in 1540-41, he could
not have been an independent agent in 1543-44.

In opposition to the identification, there are two
considerations :

(i.) A minor matter; two names are given by the
sources: Mir Baba Dost and ‘Ali-akbar.

(ii.) The important fact that Abw’l-fazl calls
Mu'azzam Hamida’s wkhuwwat-i-akhyafi, which, ac-
cording to Lane, must be rendered ‘ uterine brother.’

Was, then, the name Baba Dost a sobriquet of
Shaikh ‘Ali-akbar ?

Were Hamida and Mu‘azzam full brother and sister ?
Were they the children of one father and two mothers,
or were they uterine brother and sister?

Shaikh ‘Ali-akbar’s name I have not found in any

renders barddar-i-a'yani by ‘uterine brother.’

passage except the one dealing with Hamida’s parent-
age. Mir Baba Dost may be the man so named by
Babar (Mems., 262), and who was then with Humayun
in the year of the birth of Hindal (1519).. He may
also have gone with Humayun, Hamida (? his own
daughter) and Mu‘azzam (? his son) to Persia, the
bakhshi in the little party of exiles. He is mentioned
by Abu’l-fazl not only where already noted, but, we
believe, also amongst Hindal’s servants who were
transferred to Akbar in 1551 (958H.).

Two men with the name ‘Ali-akbar are mentioned
under Akbar, but neither appears to be a Jami, or to
warrant identification with Hamida’s reputed father.
(Cf. Ain-i-akbart, Blochmann, s.n. ‘Ali-akbar.)

Whether there was any relationship more close than
that derived from common descent from Ahmad Jami
between Maham Begam and Hamida I am not able
to say.

Hamida was related to Banu (Babu) adghaé who was
the wife of Shihabu-d-din Ahmad Nishapirt and a
relation of Maham anaga. Bega (Hajt) Begam also
had claim to descent from Ahmad Jami, so that the
saint’s posterity was numerous in Akbar’s court, and
included the Emperor himself.

To Gul-badan’s account of the discussion which
preceded Hamida’s marriage, there may be added the
following passage from the Tazkiratu-l-waqi'at of
Jauhar. (1.0. MS. No. 221 and BM. MS. Add.
No. 16,711, f. 82.) After Humayun has asked whose
daughter Hamida is, he is told, perhaps by Dil-dar,
that she is of the line of his Reverence the Terrible
Elephant, Ahmad Jami, and that her father, by way
of blessing and benediction, has taught Mirza Hindal,
and that for this reason Hamida is with the mirza’s
household. .

The Persian (taken from the I.0. MS.) is as
follows: Pidar-i-ishan do sth kalma ba jihat-i-tabarruk

wa tayammun ba Mirza Hindal sabq. farmudand. Az
Gn jihat ba mé hamra and.

Erskine (II. 220) and Stewart (Jauhar, 31 n.) both
say that Hamida was married at fourteen years of
age. The incidents of her wedded life are set down
in Gul-badan Begam’s book and in the Akbar-nama
and other sources; but having regard to her interest-
ing personality, they may be enumerated here also.

She was married at Pat early in 948H. (summer,
1541), and remained in Sind until she made with
Humayun the terrible desert journey to ‘Umrkut
where Akbar was born (October 15th, 1542). About
the beginning of the following December she and
her baby went into camp at Jin, after travelling for
ten or twelve days. In 1548 she made the perilous
journey from Sind which had Qandahar for its goal,
but in course of which Humayin had to take hasty
flight from Shal-mastan, ‘ through a desert and water-
less waste.’ She went with him, leaving her little
son behind. She accompanied her husband to Persia,
and it is recorded that on the way and at Sistan, its
governor brought his mother and his wives to enter-
tain her. With Humayin she made, amongst other
pious visitations, one to Jam where was their ancestor
Ahmad’s shrine. She was kindly treated by Shah
Tahmasp and by his sister, and Gul-badan’s details
of the Persian episode can hardly have been learned
from anyone but Hamida. In 1544, in camp at
Sabz-awar, a daughter was born. She returned from
Persia with the army given to Humayun by Tahmasp,
and at Qandahar would meet Dil-dar and Hindal, her
former protectors.

It was not until November 15th, 1545 (Ramzan 10th,
952H.) that she again saw her son, who recognised
her. She had shortly after this to accept Mah-chtchak

’ as a co-wife. In June, 1548, she and Akbar accom-
panied Humayin on his way to Taliqin as far as
Gul-bihar, and thence returned to Kabul. This may

be the expedition made by the ladies and chronicled
by Gul-badan, to see the riwaj. When Humayin, in
November, 1554, set out for Hindustan, she remained
in Kabul.

Bayazid biydt mentions that at this time he fell
under her displeasure, and was reproved because he
had not cleared out a house for one of her servants.
He pleaded the commands of Munim Khan, and was
forgiven. Early in the reign of Akbar, Khwaja Mirak,
Nizamu-d-din’s grandfather and who was her diwan,
was hanged by Mu'nim Khan because he had sided
with Mirza Sulaiman.

She rejoined her son in the second year of his reign
(964H., 1557), together with Gul-badan and other
royal ladies. She is mentioned as in Dihli in the
fifth year, and she had a part in the plot for deposing
Bairam Khan. She was closely associated with Gul-
badan in Akbar’s court and affection; together they
interceded for Salim with his father; together they
received gifts from the Emperor; and their tents were
side by side in his encampments. Hamida was with
Gul-badan in the latter’s last hours.

Abw’l-fazl says that when long fasts came to an
end, the first dishes of dressed meat used to go to
Akbar from his mother’s house.

Hamida died in the autumn of 1604 (19th Shah-
riyar 1018H.), .sixty-three years after her wedding,
and after almost fifty years of widowhood, passed as
the proud mother of a great son. If she was fourteen
in 1541, she must have been born in 1527 (circa), the
year of Babar’s victory at Khanwa, and have been
some seventy-seven years old at the time of death.

LXXXIV. Haram Begam Qibehaq Mughal.

Princess of the Haram. Her name has been trans-
literated by some European workers as Khurram,
‘blossoming, cheerful,’ and this seems the more prob-
able name to bestow on a child. But some of the
Persian texts support Haram, and the editors of the
Bib. Ind. Akbar-ndma have adopted it. Gul-badan
has Haram.

Haram Begam may be a sobriquet bestowed after
the revelation of the facts of the bearer’s character
and dominance.

Daughter of Sultan Wais Kulabit Qibchaq Mughal ;
-and sister of Chakr ‘Ali and Haidar Begs and of Mah
Begam, a wife of Kamran. She married Sulai-

- man Mirza Miran-shahi, son of Khan Mirza (Wais).
She had one son, Ibrahim (Abi’l-qasim), and several
daughters. Her children, through Shah Begam

- Badakhshi, their paternal ancestress, claimed descent
from Alexander the Great.

Most of the incidents of her career are given in the
Introduction to this book, and her remarkable char-
acter is exhibited there. Badayuni calls her Wali-
ni‘amat, and says she was known by this name. This
may be a tribute to her pre-eminence in character
and action and also to the fact of her belonging to an
older generation than Akbar’s, under whom he wrote.
The elder men of royal birth were Lords and the elder
women Ladies of Beneficence in those days.

Daughter of Isan-bigha Chaghatai and niece of
Yunas Khan; sister of Dost-muhammad and wife of
Aba-bakr Dughlat Mughal.

Tar. Rash. B. & B., 89, 99.

LXXXVII. Isin-daulat Khanam and Begam Qachin Mughal.

Her name takes several forms. The Bdbar-ndma,
Turki text (B.M. Or. Add. 26,324), has a clearly
pointed Ishdn; Ilminsky has Isén passim. An
early Persian MS. (B.M. Or. 3,714) has Isdén and
Isan.

The Memoirs have Isan in all but two instances
(p. 12), where Ais is used. But Mr. Erskine’s
Persian text (B.M. Add. 26,200), which is presum-
ably his authority, can (I venture to think, after
comparing the words he renders Ats with those he
renders Isan) yield Isam in all places, Where he
reads Ais (pp. 10 and 141) the niin is not dotted;
the letters closely correspond with those where it is
dotted, and where he reads Isan.

The Téartkh-t-rashidi (B.M. Or. 157) writes Isan.

The weight of authority is in favour of Isdan.

Isin-daulat was Babar’s maternal grandmother and
a daughter of Mir Shir-‘ali Beg Qiichin (Kunji), chief
of the Sagharichi tumdn (10,000) of the Quchin
Mughals.

She married Yanas Khan Chaghatat Mughal when
he was forty-one years old. He was born in 818H.
(1415-16), so that the date of her marriage is, approxi-
toately, 1456. At this time Yinas was made Great
Khan of the Mughals.

Isan-daulat bore three daughters, who were named -
Mihr-nigar, Qit-liq-nigar, and Khtb-nigar. She had
many brothers, of whom three, Shiram, Mazid, and

‘Ali-dost, took leading parts in Babar’s affairs. Her
chief co-wife was Shah Begam Badakhsht.

She shared the vicissitudes of her remarkable
-husband’s remarkable career for some thirty years;
nursed him through two years of paralytic helpless-
ness till his death in 892H. (1487) at the age of
seventy-four, and survived him about eighteen years.

Four times at least she fell into the hands of an
enemy :

(1) In Kashghar, cir. 860H. (1455-56), when Mihr-
nigar was an infant at the breast and when she was
returned in safety to her husband.

(2) In Tashkand in 877H. (1472-78), when Yunas
had gone to buy barley at a time of dearth in Mughal-
istan. It was then that there occurred the well-known
episode which shows Isan-daulat’s high spirit and
decision of character and which is briefly narrated in

_ the Introduction (p. 68). She was returned with
honour to her husband.

(8) In Andijan in 908H. (1497-98), when the town
was taken from her grandson Babar by his kinsfolk.
She was sent after him in safety to Khojand, and from
there went on to the protection of her third daughter’s
home in Kashghar.

(4) At Samargqand in 906H. (1500-1), when the
town was taken by Shaibani. She remained behind
when Babar left the place, and rejoined him in a few
months with his ‘family, heavy baggage, and a few
lean and hungry followers.’

In the eighth year of her widowhood (900H.) she
was guiding Babar’s affairs with decision and sense in
Andijan. He says that few women equalled her for
sagacity, far-sight and good judgment, and that many
important affairs were carried out by her counsel.

News of her death reached Babar in Kabul early in
911H. (June, 1505), during the forty days’ mourning
for his mother.

Two slight records of her remain for mention.

Desert-born .and of a tribe which clamoured against
settled life, she yet had a garden-house at Andijan.
She reared a half-sister of Babar, Yadgar, daughter of
Agha dghdcha.

The world-ruling princess; Pers. jahan, world, and
Ar. sultan, sway.

Probably a child of Humayan. She died in Kabul,
aged two, in 954H. (1547).

Gul-badan, 70a.

LXXXIX. Jamal agha.

XCI. Khadija Begam.
Presumably she was named after Muhammad's first
wife.

She was first a slave! of Sultan Abt-said Mirza,
and upon his death in 873H. (1469) she betook her-
self to ‘Harat and there became the wife of Sultan
Husain Baygqra. i

She had a daughter, known as Aq Begam, by Abi-
said, and two sons, Shah Gharib and Muzaffar
Husain, by her marriage with Husain.

’ Hers is an instance where the conferring of a

title is mentioned. Babar says that Husain was
passionately fond of her and that he raised her to the
rank of begam; also that she managed him entirely.
To her are attributed the intrigues and rebellion
which ruined Husain’s family. She acquired more
influence than any other of his wives, and it was
consequently round her surviving son Muzaffar
Husain, that adherents gathered after his father’s
death. She forced on the joint-kingship which ex-
cited Babar’s ridicule. Mirza Haidar when speaking

’ of the death of Jahangir Miran-shahi, said that he
was generally reported to have been poisoned in his
wine by Khadija Begam after her old fashion.

’ In 912H. (1506-7) Babar saw her in Harat, and he
was there unlawfully entertained by her at a wine-
party. When Shaibani conquered the city in 918H.

_she was cast down from her high estate and given up

‘to be plundered, and was treated as one of Shaibani’s
meanest slaves.

seller of rosebuds and a young and good-looking female slave. The
Persian text has the same word ghwncha-chi. The interest of these
details is the light they may cast on the use of such words as dgha and
aghiacha. .

XCII. Khadija-sultén Begam Chaghatat Mughal.

Fourth daughter of Sultan Ahmad Khan Chaghatai.
After her father’s death in 909H. (1503-4), Mirza
Aba-bakr Dughlat took possession of his capital, Aksu,
in Farghana, and with it of Khadija-sultan, then »
child. He however, says Mirza Haidar, treated her
kindly and when she was- of age, he gave her in
marriage to his son Jahangir who was ‘her second
cousin. She accompanied her husband to her full-

‘ brother Said’s court, shortly after 920H. (1514), and
while in Kashghar, Jahangir was murdered by an
unknown hand, in Yangi-hisar. She then remained,
respected and honoured, in her brother Said’s family
circle. In 928H. (1517) she was married to Shah
Muhammad Sultan Chaghatai, a grandson of Sultan
Mahmid Khan, through Muhammad, the only son of
Mahmud who survived the massacre of sulténs by
Shaibani. The marriage of one of Khadija’s brothers,
Aiman, was celebrated at the same time.

When Rashid succeeded his father Said, in Kash-
ghar (939H.—July, 1533) Khadija was badly treated
by him. She was then ill and confined to bed, but
Rashid banished her and her children and made her
start on the weary journey for Badakhshan. She died
on the road after much hardship of travel. She left
four children, Ismail, Ishaq, Ya qub, and Muhtarima.
They went on to Kabul, and were there received with
fatherly kindness. by their uncle, Isan-timur.

She was a woman of life-long piety and devotion
to good works. Perhaps for this reason her brother
who seems to have been an incarnation of unjust
cruelty, treated her with studied barbarity, as a con-
sequence of which she died in torture and suffering.

XCVIII. Khan-zada Begam Bayqrd. (No. 16.) .

The khan-born princess; Turki khan, and Pers.
zada, born.

Gul-badan says she is a daughter of Sultan Masud
Mirza Mirdn-shahi, and through a daughter grandchild
of Payanda Muhammad (sic) Sultan Begam, paternal
great-aunt of Humayun. Babar names no such mar-
riage of a daughter of Payanda. ‘The second of the
daughters [of Payanda] was Kichak Begam [whose
name is probably a sobriquet]. Sultan Masud Mirza
was extremely attached to her, but whatever efforts he
made, Payanda-sultan Begam, having an aversion to
him, would not consent to the match. She was after-
wards’ (Turki singra, P. de C. dans la suite) ‘ married
to Mulla Khwaja.’ ,

A daughter of Husain Baygraé and of Baba dghdacha,
whose name was Saadat-bakht and title Begam
Sultan, was married to Mastd after his blinding.
Her daughter. might be fitly described as of inferior
rank to the great begams. Such a description is given
by Babar of ‘Khan-zada, daughter of Sultan Masud
Mirza.’ Husain and Payanda’s daughter would
certainly rank as equal in birth to the daughters of
Abi-sa‘id, since she was a full Timirid.

The ‘extreme attachment’ of Mas id to Kichak fits
Musalman marriage better than Musalman courtship.
It may be that, spite of Payanda’s opposition, Mas ud
married Kichak. The ‘afterwards’ of the Memoirs
(supra) and the de la suite of Pavet de Courteille
seem to demand some more definite antecedent than

a
Mas‘id’s attachment. Moreover, this presumably
persisted with his wish to marry Kichak.
' Did he marry Kichak, and was she divorced after
his blinding or at some other time, and then was
' Sa'adat-bakht given to him ?

Mems., 181, 182, 887.

" XCIX. Khan-zada Begam Miran-shahi.

Daughter of ‘Umar Shaikh Mirza Miran-shahit and
of Qut-liq-nigir Khanam; full-sister of Babar and
five years his senior. Eldest of her father’s daughters.
She is recorded as thrice married: first, to Shaibani
in 1501 (907H.) ; secondly, to a man of inferior rank,
Sayyid Hada; and, thirdly, to Mahdi Muhammad
Khwaja,! son of Misa Khwaja. One child of hers is
recorded, Shaibani’s son, Khurram-shah Sultan.

She was born circa 1478 (888H.). This is known
from the statement of her brother that she was five
years his senior. In 1501 (907H.) she was married
by Shaibani when he captured Samargand from
Babar. Gul-badan makes the marriage a condition
of Shaibani’s peace with Babar; Haidar says she
was given in exchange for Babar’s life, and Khafi
Khan, as a ransom (ba tariq-i-faida). She was in
Shaibani’s power and could have been married with-
out consent of Babar. As in 1501 she was twenty-
three years old, she had almost certainly been
married before, possibly to Mahdi.. Her marriage
arrangements with Shaibani might include the divorce
which the Musalman law requires. Babar does not
go into details as to the marriage; he says she fell
into Shaibani’s hands. Presumably as himself of

- Timtrid birth, Shaibani would treat a Timitirid woman
_with respectful forms even when she was spoil of
-battle. To marry Khan-zada, he divorced her
maternal aunt, Mihr-nigar Chaghatai.

Khan-zada’s son by Shaibani, Khurram-shah, died
a@ young man. Shaibani divorced her because she
leaned to her brother’s side in disputed matters. He
then gave her in marriage to a certain Sayyid Hada, ..
who fell in the battle of Merv with Shaibani himself
(1510).

In 1511 and at the age of thirty-three, she was
returned to Babar by Shah Ismail. At what date she
married Mahdi Muhammad Khwaja I am not able to
say. It is probable that the marriage would take
place within no long time after her return. As Mahdi
is never described by Babar in any way (as is his
custom when a new actor comes upon the scene of
his Memoirs), it is probable that Mahdi’s joining
Babar and his marriage with Khan-zada took place in
the decade 1509-19, of which no record is known to
survive.. Mahdi was with Babar in 1519 (925H.),
and is frequently mentioned subsequently.

There are many references to Khan-zada by Gul-
badan who frequently calls her Dearest Lady (aka-
janam). She died at Qabal-chak in 1545 (952H.), aged
about sixty-seven years, and after a life full of sorrows
and chagrins.

CXVII. Maham Begam: aka and akam (lady and my lady).

The word Maham is explained by Mr. Erskine (who
did not know Gul-badan’s book) as Babar’s name of
endearment for his favourite wife, and as meaning
‘my moon.’ Mr. Schuyler also translates it by the
same words. He says that a woman who was shot
for political offences in Bukhara was known as ‘ My
moon (Maham) of Keninghez.’

But many Mahams are chronicled, and not only
Babar gives the name to Humayin’s mother; Gul-
badan speaks frequently of ‘my lady who was Maham
Begam,’ and Maham seems to be her personal name.
It is used at least once as a man’s. (Akbar-nama, I.
820, Maham ‘Ali Quli Khan.)

Whether maham is to be classed with sultanam,
khanam, begam, shaham, I am unable to say.

Sir Douglas Forsyth (Mission to Yarkand, 84)
translates khanam and begam by my lord and my
ehief. But neither is a domestic word; both are in
common use in the sources to designate, for general
readers, the wives or daughters of khans and begs,
or princes. Sultanam also is a common title, and
from Gul-badan’s use of it does not appear to be a
personal name, but to answer to sultan as khanam
to khan, etc..

Against reading khanam as my lady, with a sense
of possession or admission of superiority (as is done
by Sir Douglas Forsyth), there are the Turki words
formed from it, viz., khdnam-ali, honeysuckle, and
khinam-bijaki, ladybird. Shaham, which has the
appearance of being formed from shah like the others
by the suffix am or im, is used both for man and
woman. Shiram occurs as a man’s name.

Maham was a wife of whom it was said that she was
to Babar what ‘Ayisha was to Muhammad, and she
was Humayun’s mother. Gul-badan mentions her
often, yet no one of the numerous sources I have
consulted, sets down her family or the name of her
father.

At one time it appeared to me probable that she was
a Begchik Mughal, because Babar calls Yadgar Begchik,
taghat when speaking of him in connection with
Humayun. Further consideration led to the abandon-
ment of the theory.

Uncle Yadgar, Uncle ‘Ali, and Uncle Ibrahim (Cha-
puk, slashed-face) are named as being three of the
eight brothers or half-brothers of Gul-rukh, the mother


--- Page 286 ---
Courtesy www.pdfbooksfree.pk
257

of Kamran; and Bega (Haji) Begam is the daughter
of Uncle Yadgar.

Amongst these eight Begchiks I do not find one
named Uncle Muhammad ‘Ali, and there is a good_
- deal to lead one to regard a certain Khwaja Muham-
mad ‘Ali faghat as being Maham’s brother.

He was associated with Khost, and it is on record
that Humayuan visited his maternal grandparents
(nanaha) in Khost. The Begchiks do not seem to
have been connected with Khost. Babar speaks
frequently of Khwaja Muhammad ‘Ali as being em-
ployed in the government of Khost (925H.); as coming
from Khost for orders, etc., and the mzr-zddas of Khost
also are recorded as visiting the court. One of Maham’s
children was born in Khost.

Babar frequently mentions an ‘Abdu-l-malik Khosti,
and he may be a connection of Maham. He, however,
appears as Khosti, Khwasti, Qasti, qiirchi, Qiérchin,
and without a more complete good Turki text no
opinion can be formed as to his identity.

Gul-badan says that Aka (Maham) was related to the
owners of the New Year’s Garden in Kabul, and this
was made by Ulugh Beg Kabult Mtran-shahi.

Abiu‘l-fazl says Maham was of a noble Khurasan
family, related to Sultan Husain Mirza (Bayqra), and,
like Hamida-banu Begam, was of the lina of Shaikh
Ahmad Jami (az diidman-i-a‘yan wa ashraf-i-Khurdsan
and, wa ba Sultan Husain Mirza nisbat-i-khwesh darand.
Perhaps nisbat-i-khwesh implies blood-relationship on —
the father’s side.

Gul-badan speaks of Maham’s Mughal servants, but
a Chaghatai, a Begchik, a Qichin is also a Mughal,
and Babar often sinks the divisional tribe-name in the
general one, Mughal (¢.g., Mems. 9 and 21).

Some considerations suggest that Maham was a
Dughlat Mughal, and of the family of ‘Abdu-l-qadiis,
but no valid opinion can be formed until a text as
good as the Elphinstone is available for guidance.

There is a Turki word jijuq, but its meaning of
sweet-savoured is less appropriate for a woman’s
name than a word which, spite of vowel variation
it seems safer to take from the Persian; viz.
chachak, a rose, and chachak, chuchuk, a lovely
cheek, a mole.

By Qasim, she was mother of Nahid Begam and by
Shah Hasan of his only child, Chuchak or Mah-
chuchak, Kamran’s wife.

She had an interesting story which Mr. Erskine
tells at length. (B. & H., I. 848 et seq..)

On the death of ‘Isa (975H.) his son and successv.,
Muhammad Baqi Tarkhan, who was a madman, ill-
treated Mah-chiichak and Nahid who was then visit.
ing her. This led to a plot against him, but in the
end Mah-chuchak was imprisoned by him and starved
to death. (Cf. s.n. Nahid.)

Daughter of Shah Hasan and Mah-chuchak Arghiin
and her father’s only child; wife of Kamran; married
953H. (1546). Her wifely fidelity is commemorated
by the historians. She went with Kamran to Makka
after his blinding, and attended him until his

CXXIV. Mah-chuchak Begam. |

Sister of Bairam Oghlan and of Faridin Khan
Kabuli.

She married Humayun in 1546. She had two sons,
Muhammad Hakim (born 960H.—1553) and Farrakh-
fal. Gul-badan says she had four daughters and then,
with discrepancy frequently found in her writings,
names three: Bakht-nisa', Sakina-banu, and Amina-
banu. The name of the best-known of her girls,
Fakhru-n-nisa’, is omitted.

Mah-chichak’s story is told by her sister-in-law,
in the Introduction of this volume, by Mr. Bloch-
mann and by several Persian writers.

She was murdered by Shah Abw’l-ma‘ali in Kabul
in 1564.

she is very possibly a Chaghatai on her mother’s side
(Umid was an Andijani), or the style is due to her
martiage with a khan. She appears to have married
- a man of high rank; perhaps Kichum (Qich-hunjt)

Khan who was Khaqan of his tribe from 1510 to 1580,
or his son and successor (ruled from 1530 to 1533):
She had a son Pulad whom Babar mentions as fighting
with ‘ Qich-kunji’ and his son Abi-sa'id Uzbeg at Jam
(1528).

The Qich-kunji was the tribe of Isan-daulat.

Kichim, Abu-sa‘id, Mihr-bani, and Pulad sent
ambassadors and messengers to Babar in the same
year, and Babar mentions his return gifts with quaint
particularity. The envoys were entertained at a feast
by him on December 12th, 1528 (935H.).

wife of Sultan Ahmad Mirza Mirdn-shahi; first cousin
of Babar.

In 905H. (early in July, 1500) she was captured by
Shaibani and married by him. In 906H. (1500-1)
she was divorced when he wished to marry Khan-zada,
her niece. She then stayed awhile in Samargand.
In 907H. (1501-2) she went to Tashkand and joined

the large family party which assembled there. (Mems.

99.) In 911H. (middle of 1505) she came to Kabul

with other kinsfolk, soon after the death of her grand-

mother (Isan) and of her father, and during the cere-.

monial mourning of Babar for his mother. ‘Our
. grief broke out afresh,’ he writes.

Mirza Haidar gives a pleasant account of the welcome

she accorded her generous and kindly nephew Babar
in 912H. (1506-7), when he put down Khan Mirza’s
(Wais) rebellion in Kabul: ‘The Emperor leapt up
and embraced his beloved aunt with every manifesta-
tion of affection. The khanam said to him: ‘‘ Your
children, wives, and household are longing to see you.
I give thanks that I have been permitted to see you
again. Rise up and go to your family in the castle.
T too am going thither.” ’
- In 9138H. (1507), when Khan Mirza set out for
Badakhshan with his mother, Shah Begam, to try his
fortunes in her father’s ancient lands, Mibr-nigar also
‘took a fancy to go. It would have been better and
more becoming,’ writes Babar, ‘for her to remain
with me. I was her nearest relation. But however
much I dissuaded her, she continued obstinate and
also set out for Badakhshan.

Mihr-nigar rued her self-will. She and Shah Begam
were captured on their way to Qila'-zafar by one of
Abi-bakr Dughlat’s ‘marauding bands,’ and ‘in the
prisons of that wretched miscreant they departed from
this perishable world.’

daughters: Bairam (or Maryam) and Fatima.

CXLII. Mubarika Bibi; Afghani aghacha. (No. 56.)
Ar. mubdrika, blessed, fortunate.

She was a daughter of Shah Manstr Yasufzai, and
was married by Babar at Kehraj on January 380th,
1519 (Muharram 28th, 925H.). The alliance was the
sign and seal of amity between him and her tribe.
A charming account of her and her marriage is given
in the Tartkh-i-hafiz-t-rahmat-khani, and Mr. Beveridge
has translated it in full under the title ‘An Afghan
Legend,’ so that it need not be reproduced here.

Gul-badan never gives the name Mubarika (Blessed
Damozel) as that of the Afghan lady (Afghani aghacha)
whom she so frequently and pleasantly mentions.
Hafiz Muhammad (l.c.) says that Mubarika was much
beloved by Babar, and this is borne out by the fact
that she was one of the small and select party of
ladies who were the first to join him in India. She
went there, it is safe to infer, with Maham and Gul-
badan in 1529.

She bore no child, and this misfortune Hafiz
Muhammad attributes to the envy of other wives who
administered drugs to deprive her of motherhood and
weaken her husband’s affection.

She died early in Akbar’s reign.

A brother of Mubarika, named Mir Jamal, accom-
panied Babar to Hindustan in 1525, and rose to high
office under Humayun and Akbar. MHindal had a
favourite follower of this name who passed, on his
death, into Akbar’s service. He may well be the
Yusufzai.

(1468-69) of Sultan Mahmud Mirza Miran-shahi;
mother by Mahmud of three daughters and one son,
Bayasanghar (born 882H.).

Babar does not give the name of any one of the three
girls, nor does he mention that one of them was a
wife of his own. One married Malik Muhammad
Mirza Miran-shahi. The Ma‘asir-i-rahtmi supplies
the information that another was Salha-sultan Begam
and that she had a daughter by Babar whose name
was Gul-rukh; that Gul-rukh married Nuru-d-din
Muhammad Chaganiani, and had by him Salima-
sultan Begam. Abu’l-fazl says that a daughter of
Pasha by Sultan Mahmud Mirza was married to
Khwaja Hasan Khwdaja-zdda, and that on account of
this connection Firdaus-makani (Babar) married Mirza
Nuru-d-din to his own daughter, Gul-barg Begam, and
that Salima-sultan Begam was the issue of this
marriage. :

(There are difficulties connected with the account
here given of Salha which are set forth under the
name of her daughter, Salima-sultan.)

Khan. (Cf. genealogical table s.n. Salima-sultan.)

CLXI. Rabi‘a-sultan Begam Bayqra and Bedka Begam
Bayqra.

These two names may indicate the same person.

The Memoirs (176 and 177) say that Sultan Husain
Mirza Bayqra had two full-sisters, Aka and Bedka,
and that Bedka married Ahmad Haji ‘'arkhan, and
had two sons who served Sultan Husain.

These statements are contained also in the Turki
texts (B.M. Add. 26,324, and Ilminsky), and also in
a considerable number of good Persian texts in the

' British Museum and. Bodleian.


--- Page 302 ---
Courtesy www.pdfbooksfree.pk

273

There is, however, this difference of statement.
The Turki texts write: Bedka Begam ham mirza ninak
aika-cht st aidi. P. de C. translates: était aussi
Vainée du mirza. The Persian texts have: Bedka
Begam ki khwahar-i-khurd mirza bid; and from this
Mr. Erskine translates: .. . the mirza’s younger sister.

The Turki, it should be observed, uses of Aka
precisely the same word as of Bedka, aikd-chi si.

It may be right to regard Bedka as the younger of
the two sisters of the mirza, and not as the sister
younger than the mirza.

To pass now to what has led me to make a tenta-
tive identification of Bedka with Rabi‘a-sultan.

The Memoirs (181) mention Rabi‘a-sultan as the
younger sister of the mirza (Husain) and as having
two sons, Babar and Murad who were given in
marriage to two daughters of Husain.

The Turki texts do not describe Rabi‘a-sultan in
any way, or say that she was Husain’s sister. They
simply mention the marriages.

The Persian texts say of Husain’s two daughters
(Bega and Agha): ba pisardn-i-khwahar-i-khurd-i-
khudra Rabv'a-sultan Begam, Babar Mirza wa Sultan
Murad Mirza, dada bidand.

The Persian texts which state that Rabi'‘a-sultan
was Husain’s own sister, have greater authority than
most translations can claim for such additional in-
formation as is here given, because the Persian trans-
lation of the Tazitk-i-babart was made in a court circle
and at a date when such additional statements were
likely to be known to many living persons.

Husain may have had a younger and half-sister,
but the words in the Persian texts which are used of
Rabi‘a-sultan are those used of Bedka, and they are

sobriquet, and Rabi‘a-sultan may be the personal name
of Bedka. Perhaps the word Bedka is Bega.

The facts of Bedka’s descent are as follows: she
was a daughter of Manstr Mirza Bayqra and of Firoza
Begam Mirdn-shaht, and thus doubly a Timtrid. She
was full-sister of Bayqra and Husain Mirzas and of .
Aka Begam. She married Ahmad Khan Haji V'arkhan,
and had two sons whose names (if Bedka be Rabi'‘a-
sultan) were Babar and Murad and who married two of
her nieces, Bega and Agha.

CLXIX. Salha-sultan Begam Miran-shahi.
Cf. Salima-sultan Chaqaniant.

CLXX. Salima-sultan Begam Chaqaniani.

Daughter of Mirza Nirv-d-din Muhammad Chaqa-
nidni and of a daughter of Babar, as to whose name
the sources ring changes upon the rose. She appears
as Gul-rang (B. and H. s.n.), Gul-barg, Gul-rukh. As
her mother was a full Turkoman or Turk by descent,
it has occurred to me that she may have borne a
Turki name, and that the various forms it assumes in
the Persian may have their origin in this.

As to her maternal parentage there are difficulties.
From the Ma‘dasir-i-rahimi, under 1024H., the follow-
ing information is obtained. Pasha Begam Baharla
Turkoman married (873H., 1469) as her second husband,
Sultan Mahmud Mirza Mirdn-shahi. By him she had
three daughters and one son: Bayasanghar (b. 882H.,
1477). One daughter whose name was Salha-sultan
Begam, married Babar and bore him a daughter,
Gul-rukh (sic). Gul-rukh married Nuru-d-din Muham-
mad Chaqaniani, and their daughter was Salima-
sultan Begam who married first, Bairam Khan-i-khanan,
and secondly, the Emperor Akbar.

Abw‘l-fazl (Bib. Ind. ed., II. 65) adds the particular
that Firdaus makani gave his daughter Gul-barg (sic),
to Nuru-d-din because a daughter of Mahmud and
Pasha had been given to Nuru-d-din’s grandfather
Khwaja Hasan, known as Khwaja-zada Chaqaniani.
He also states that Salima-sultan Begam was the issue
of Gul-barg’s marriage.

In the Memoirs, as we have them, there is no
mention of Salha-sultan nor of Nuru-d-din’s marriage
with a daughter of Babar. Yet Abu‘l-fazl states that
Firdaus-makani arranged Gul-barg’s marriage. The
first omission is the more remarkable because Babar
(Mems., 30) states that Pasha had three daughters.
He does not give their names, and specifies the


--- Page 306 ---
Courtesy www.pdfbooksfree.pk

277

marriage of the eldest only. On the same page he
tells of his marriage with Salha’s half-sister Zainab
and of her death. The omission is remarkable and
appears to have no good ground, since he chronicles
his other Timurid marriages. Of Pasha’s daughters
it may be noted here that one married Malik Muham-
mad Miran-shahi, another Khwaja Hasan Chaqdaniani,
and the third, Babar.

It appears to me tolerably clear that Babar’s marriage
with Salha-sultan took place at a date which falls in a
gap of the Memoirs, i.¢e., from 1511 to 1519. This is
the period which contains the exile from Kabul after
the Mughal rebellion.

Not only does Babar omit Salha-sultan’s name and
his marriage with her (Mems., 30), but Gul-badan is
also silent as to name, marriage and child of Salha-
sultan. This silence is in every way remarkable. She
enumerates her father’s children and gives their
mothers’ names, and she enumerates some of his
wives in more places than one. From her lists a
Timurid wife cannot have escaped, and especially
one whose child became the mother of Gul-badan’s
associate Salima-sultan.

An explanation of Gul-badan’s silence and also of a
part of Babar’s has suggested itself to me; it is con-
jectural merely and hypothetical. The absence of
mention of Salha-sultan and of her child suggests that
she appears under another name in Gul-badan’s list
of her father’s children and their mothers. She may
be Gul-badan’s own mother, Dil-dar Begam without.
undue wresting of known circumstantial witness.

The principal difficulty in the way of this identifi-
cation is Abu’l-fazl’s statement that Nuru-d-din’s
marriage was made by Firdaus-makani, whereas Gul-
badan states that her father arranged two Chaghatai
marriages for her sisters.

If we might read Jannat-ashyant (Humayun) for
Firdaus-makant much would fall into place; the


--- Page 307 ---

278

marriage with Nuru-d-din could be a re-marriage of
Gul-chihra who was widowed in 15338, and of whose
remarriage nothing is recorded until her brief political
alliance with ‘Abbas Uzbeg in 1549. It is probable
that she remarried in the interval.

To pass on to recorded incidents of Salima-sultan’s
life :

There is an entry in Hindal’s guest-list which may
indicate her presence.

She accompanied Hamida-banu and Gul-badan to
Hindustan in 964H. (1557), and she was married at
Jalindhar shortly after Safar 15th, 965H. (middle of
December, 1557) to Bairam Khdan-i-khanan. It is said
that the marriage excited great interest at Court. It
united two streams of descent from ‘Ali-shukr Beg
Bahdarli Turkoman. Salima-sultan was a Timurid
through Babar, one of her grandfathers, and through
Mahmid, one of her great-grandfathers.

A few words must be said about her age at the time
of her marriage, because the question has been raised
through Jahangir’s statement that she died atthe
age of sixty in 1021H., and commented upon by the
Darbar-i-akbart. If Jahangir gives her age correctly
she must have been born in 961H., and this would
make her a child of five when she married Bairam,
and needs her betrothal by her father to Bairam to
date from babyhood.

The Darbdr-i-akbart says that it is clear from
Jahangir’s statement of her age at death that she was
married to Bairam etat. 5, and that her memory is
thus cleared from the reproach of two marriages !

Whatever is concealed in Jahangir’s ‘sixty,’ nothing
is said to indicate that he desired to bting Salima-
sultan into the circle of Hindu propriety. He may
have had the wish; he was a Hindu mother’s son.
The comment of the modern author of the Darbar-i-


--- Page 308 ---
Courtesy www.pdfbooksfree.pk
279

akbart witnesses to the Hindiizing action to which
Moslim custom and thought have submitted. Adult
. remarriage was no reproach to Islam in Salima’s day.

It does not, however, seem correct to accept Jahangir’s
statement that Salima-sultan was sixty only at death.
To have betrothed her as a baby and to have married
her to a man of, at least, middle-age at five, is not in
harmony with the Muhammad custom of Humaytn’s
day. Moreover, Jahangir himself speaks of her as
married (kad-khuda) to Bairam. She is said by Abu’!-
fazl to have been betrothed (némzad) by Humayun,
and married (sipurdan) by Akbar to Bairam Khan.

Baddyuni’s words indicate adult and not child

“marriage; sabiqa dar habdla-i-Bairam Khan Khan-i-
khanan bid, b‘ad azan dakhl-i-haram-t-paddshahi shiid.

After the murder of Bairam in 968H. Salima-sultan
was married by Akbar. She was probably a few years
his senior.

In 983H. she made her pilgrimage with Gul-badan.
Particulars of the expedition are given in the Intro-
duction to this volume.

Her name appears in the histories as a reader, a
poet who wrote under the pseudonym of makhfi, and
as pleading with Akbar for Salim’s forgiveness.

Her death is chronicled by Jahangir who heard of it
on Zu’l-qa‘da 2nd, 1021H. (December 15th, 1612). He
gives particulars of her birth and descent, and of her
marriages; and he states that she was sixty at the
time of her death. By his orders her body was laid in
a garden which she herself had made.

Jahangir praises her both for her natural qualities
and her acquirements. She creates an impression of
herself as a charming and cultivated woman.

Sarv-i-sahi, to use Gul-badan’s word, was a singer
and reciter. She belonged to the households both of
Babar and Humayin, and was subsequently married,
with full nisbat, to Munim Ahan-i-khanan.

She acted as go-between of Mu‘nim and Khan-i-
zaman (‘Ali Quli Uzbeg-i-shaibant) during the rebellion
of the latter—probably in the tenth year of Akbar,
and Bayazid calls her a reliable woman and the
haram of the Khdn-i-khandn. She sang on the way to
Lamghan by moonlight in 958H. (1551); she was with
Mu‘nim at the time of his death in Gaur (Safar,
983H., 1575), and in Rajab of the same year accom-
panied Gul-badan to Makka.

CLXXVII. Shah Begam Badakhshi.
The princess of royal blood.

She was one of six daughters of Shah Sultan
Muhammad, King of Badakhshan, the last of a long
line of hereditary rulers of his country who claimed
descent from Alexander of Macedon. Her mother was
a sister of Sultan Sanjar Barlas.

She was given in marriage to Yunas Khan Cha-
ghatat and was the mother of Mahmud and Ahmad
Khans and of Sultan-nigar and Daulat Khanams.
She was widowed in 892H. (1487), and survived Yunas
more than twenty years.

She dwelt in Mughalistin with her elder son,
Mahmud, the then Khaqan of the Mughals, from the

. time of Yinas’ death until about 911H. (1505-6).
Then ‘base advisers provoked a quarrel between the
mother and son—a son so obedient that he had never
even mounted for a ride without her permission. .. .
They [the base advisers] decided to send Shah Begam
to Shahi Beg Khan to solicit a country for herself,
because she found living in Mughalistan distasteful. .
Now, as the Begam was a very sensible woman, she
went under this pretext, and thus left her son before
those base advisers could bring about an open rupture,
which would have caused endless scandal and reproach
to herself. The rumour was that she had gone to
entreat Shahi Beg Khan while she was really enjoying
in Samargand the company of her children.’ (Tar.
Rash, H. & R., 180.)

Shahi Beg did not permit her to remain in Samar-
qand but banished her to Khurasan. From Khurasan
she went with other connections and relations to
Babar in Kabul. They arrived early in 911H. (June,

. 1505), during the ceremonial mourning for Babar’s
mother, Shah Begam’s stepdaughter. With Shah
Begam was Haidar Mirza’s father and also Babar’s
aunt, Mihr-nigar. Haidar says that Babar gave the
party a warm welcome and showed them all possible


--- Page 313 ---

284

honour; and that they spent some time in Kabul in
the greatest ease and comfort.

Babar’s kindness fell on ungrateful ground, since
in the following year, 912H. (1506-7), Shah Begam
fomented a rebellion against him in favour of her
grandson, Mirza Khan. Haidar says that during
Babar’s absence in Harat her motherly love (it was
grandmotherly) began to burn in her heart, and per-
suaded her that Babar was dead, and that room was
thus made for Mirza Khan. The story of Babar’s
magnanimity to her when he had put down the rising
she had stirred, is well known and is detailed in the
histories.

In 918H. (1507-8) she laid claim to Badakhshan,
saying that it had been her family's hereditary king-
dom for 3,000 years; that though she, a woman,
could not attain to sovereignty, her grandson would
not be rejected. Babar assented to her scheme, and
she set off for Badakhshan, together with Mihr-nigar
Khanam and Mirza Khan.

The latter went on in advance to Qila'-zafar. The
.ladies and their escort were at once attacked and
plundered by robber bands in the employ of the ruler
of Kashghar, Aba-bakr Dughiat, and were by them
conveyed to him in Kashghar. They were placed in
confinement, and ‘in the prison of that wicked mis-
creant they departed from this perishable world’ (cir.
918H.).

Daughter of Sultan Abi-sa‘id Mirza Miran-shahi ;
wife of Sultan Husain Mirza Baygra, and married to
him before his accession in 873H. (March, 1469).

Babar gives an entertaining detail about her married
life. Once at Chekman her husband was engaged in
battle with her brother Mahmid. All his ladies
except herself alighted from their litters and mounted
on horseback, presumably for rapid flight if the day
went against Husain. Shahr-banu, however, ‘ relying
on her brother,’ remained in her litter. This being
reported to her husband, he divorced her and married
her younger sister, Payanda-sultan.

Of her subsequent history nothing seems recorded.

Yadgar-nasir Mirza, in 1540 and after the débacle in

to Kamran in Qandahar (a traitor cast aside by his
employer, Shah Husain Arghiin), Kamran sent am-
bassadors to Shah Husain to request that the begam
and her son might be returned to his charge. [Shahr-
banu was Kamran’s paternal (half)-aunt and full-aunt
of Yadgar-nasir.]

She was at once started on her journey, but was
insufficiently provided with necessaries for traversing
the difficult desert tract which stretches towards the
western mountain barrier of Sind. Numbers of her
party perished before reaching Shal (Quetta); and
many died in that town from ‘malignant fever.’

Daughter of Sultan Husain Mirza Baygraé and Chili

only child. She married, first, her cousin Wais, son
of her father’s elder brother Bayqra, and, secondly,
‘Abdu-]-baqi. Mirza Mirdn-shahi. By her first marriage
she had a son, Muhammad Sultan Mirza, and a
daughter who married Isan-quli Shaibani, younger
brother of Yili-bars Sultan. Through her son
Muhammad she was ancestress of those numerous
rebel Baygras whom history knows as ‘ the mirzas.’

When the Uzbegs took Harat in 1507 (918H.) she
went to Khwarizm, and there her daughter was
married. On April 12th, 1519 (Rabi‘ II. 12th, 925H.),
Babar records her arrival with her daughter in Kabul. ~
He gave her the Garden of Retirement (Bagh-i-khilwat)
for her residence, and waited upon her with the ccre-
mony due to an elder sister. He bowed and she
bowed; he advanced, they embraced; and having
established this form of greeting, they kept to it.

Sultanam started from Kabul for India in, 1527
with a grandson (her sons had six sons), but she died
at the Indus and her body was taken back to Kabul
for burial.

There are curious discrepancies of the texts in the
passage about Sultanam which occurs at Mems., 181.

elder brother of Sultanam give her in marriage. But
she was an only child, and her father was living to act
for her. The French version, here as in so many other
places, appears to have relied upon Mr. Erskine.
The Turki text appears to yield something more
probable, i.e., ‘His elder brother, Bayqra Mirza’s
middle son, Sultan Wais Mirza... .’

Mr. Erskine has read midngt as part of Bayqra’s
name. Comparison with the Turki makes appear as
the more probable reading: ‘the middle son —pisari-
midngi.

M. Pavet de Courteille’s fils cadet lets slip the notion
of miydn. Redhouse gives for the ortdnchit oghal of
the Turki text, ‘the middle son out of an odd number’

“—e.g., the third out of five, the second of three, etc..

In the same passage the Memoirs have: ‘ Sultanam
Begam set out along with her grandson. . Here
the Persian words ba hamin tarikh (Turki, ushbi tartkh)
are omitted, with loss of precision, for they fix the date
of her journey by conveying the information that it
occurred at the time of her son’s appointment to the
government of Kanauj, t.e., April, 1527.

CLXXXVI. Sultanam Begam Miran-shahi. (No. 12.)

Daughter of Sultan Ahmad Mirza.

A Sultanam of this parentage is mentioned by Babar
(Mems., 22), by Haidar (E. & R., 8.n.), and by Gul-~
badan (24b). These appear to be at least two, and
perhaps are three women. Their record is as follows :

(1). Sultanam, fourth daughter of Sultan Ahmad
Mirza. (Mems., 22.) She was the child of Qutiq
(Katak) Begam. She married her cousin ‘Ali, son of
Mahmud Mirza. ‘Ali was murdered by Shaibani
(cf. s.n. Zubra) in 906H. (July, 1500), and his widow
was taken to wife by Shaibani’s son, Muhammad
Timtr. A third marriage is mentioned by Babar,
viz., to Mahdi Sultan. By this style the histories
mention the Uzbeg chief who was associated with
Hamza (Khamza) Sultan. But this Mahdi was put to
death by Babar in 1511, and Timir was living in 1512
(918H.). Hither Sultanam was divorced, perhaps to
make marriage with some other kinswoman and later
captive legal; or Mahdi Sultan may be the father
of ‘Adil Sultan; or he may be Mahdi Muhammad
Khwaja.

(2). Sultanam, daughter of Sultan Ahmad Mirza,
married Muhammad Husain Dughlat in the autumn
of 1503. She was given to her husband by Khusrau
Shah who describes her as daughter of Sultan Ahmad
Mirza wa padshah-zada-i-man, by which Mr. Ross has
understood that she was of Khusrau’s ‘family.’
There was a son, issue of this marriage and named
“Abdu-l-lah.

It is difficult to regard No. 1 and No. 2 as one woman,
both because of their marriage dates and of the circum-
stance that No. 1 was an Uzbeg captive and No. 2
in Badakhshan. Babar mentions no marriage of a
Sultanam with Muhammad Husain Dughlat. A sur-
mise—it is nothing more—has occurred to me,
namely: No. 2 was married to the Dughlat mirza
Shortly after the destruction of Tashkend; Babar's

wife ‘Ayisha, third daughter of Sultan Ahmad Miran-
shahi, had left Babar shortly before that disaster.
She might be Sultanam No. 2.

(3). Sultanam, or Sultani, daughter of Sultan Ahmad
Mirza, was at the Mystic Feast in 1531.. She is said
to be the mother of Kilan Khan Begam. This title is
not appropriate for the child of any of the marriages
mentioned for No. 1 or No. 2. It is quite appropriate
for the child of the marriage of Sultan Ahmad and
Qutiq’s firstborn daughter, Rabi‘a-sultan, because

- Rabi‘a married Sultan Mahmid Khan who was the
Elder Khan (kilan) and also the Great Khan (Khaqan)
of the Mughals. Shaibani murdered five of Mahmud’s ©
six sons, but probably his girls escaped because of their
value as wives.

The above notes make for the opinion that Sul-
tanam is a title, and not a name. Cf. app. s.n.

CLXXXVITI. Sultan-nigar Khanam Chaghatat Mughal.

Daughter of Yunas Khan Chaghatai and Shah
Begam Badakhshi; wife of Sultan Mahmud Mirza
Miran-shahi; mother of Sultan Wais (Khan Mirza) ;
widowed in 900H. (January, 1495).

On Mahmud’s death in Samarqand she joined her
brothers in Tashkand, going off ‘ without giving any
notice of her intentions,’ says Babar. Later on she
married Awiq (Adik) Sultan Jaji, the chief of the
Uzbeg Qazaqs. Her story is somewhat confused in
fhe Memoirs (13 and 14) by a double mention of her

marriage to Awiq. Haidar Mirza throws some light,
and it seems that when Shaibani had murdered her
brother, Mahmud Khan, Awiq left him and joined
the Uzbeg Qazaqs, his own people, and Sultan-nigar_
followed him into Mughalistan.

She had two daughters by Awigq, one of whom
married ‘Abdu-l-lah Qéichin and died a young wife,
and the other married Rashid Sultan Chaghatai.

On Awiq’s death, Sultan-nigar was married to his
brother Qasim, presumably in consonance with the
Turki custom of yang-lik.

With Qasim’s death, the khanship of the Qazdqs
devolved on Sultan-nigar’s stepson (i.e., Awiq’s by a
co-wife) named Tahir. ‘ He was,’ says Haidar, ‘very
much attached to her, and even preferred her to the
mother who had given him birth.’

What follows is full of colour and feeling. Nigar-
sultan showed her appreciation of Tahir’s affection, but
petitioned him, saying: ‘ Although you are (as) my
child, and I neither think of nor desire any son but
you, yet I wish you to take me to my nephew, Sultan
Said Khan. For I am grown old, and I have no
longer the strength to bear this wandering life in the
deserts of Uzbegistan. Take me where I may enjoy
some quiet and repose.’ She then offered to mediate

‘ for him and to obtain the support for him of the
Mughal Khaqans against his foes. Tahir accordingly
escorted her to the Mughalistan borders, and with her
waited upon Said. ‘The latter, from love of his
aunt, rose, saying that although his rising to receive
Tahir was contrary to the rules of Chingiz (their
common ancestor), yet that he did it out of gratitude
because Tahir had brought his aunt.’

Sultan-nigar died of a hemorrhage in the summer
of 934H. (1528).

CLXXXIX. Tarkhan Begam.
This is a title, and not a personal name.

In Babar’s time, according to Mr. Erskine (Mems.,
24 n.), the ancient title of Tarkhan had come to
belong to a particular family or clan. This may be well
seen by consulting Professor Blochmann’s Ain-i-akbart,
361, where the genealogical table of the Arghuns of
Tatta shows the title to have become hereditary in
their branch of the Arghuns.1

The Tarkhan Begam whose name stands above this
notice was linked with these Tarkhan Arghins in the
way shown below. She married her first cousin,
Ahmad Mirdan-shaht, and Qutiq Begam was her foster-
sister.

1 Professor Blochmann (l.c.) states that ‘Abdu-l-‘ali and five sons
were murdered by Shaibani, but Babar and the Sind historians give
no support to the story. It looks as though by some clerical error the
account of the murder of Sultan Mahmiid Khan and his sons had crept
in hero. Shaibini drove Baqi out of his late father’s government of
Bukhara.

by his grandmother, Isan-daulat. She was a post-
humous child, and, if one may draw an inference
from her example and others similar, is for this
reason called Yadgar (Souvenir). Her father died
Ramzan 4th, 899H. (June 9th, 1494). When a child of
not more than ten, and in 908H. (1503), she fell into
the hands of ‘Abdu-l-latif Uzbeg, after the conquest of
Andijan and Akhsi by Shaibani, and in 916H. (1511)
Babar’s successes at Khutlan and Hisar enabled her
to return to him and her own people.

I do not find any marriage mentioned for her by
her name.

She was married at the instance of Qut-liq-nigar, in
the year of the capture of Kabul, z.c., 910H. (1504-5),
perhaps at the time that Jahangir Mirza, Babar’s half-
brother, married her half-sister, Aq Begam. The
marriage was not happy. Two or three years later
Zainab died of small-pox.

whom Muhammadi Barlds put to death; mother of
Ibrahim who was born 930H. (1524), Sa‘id’s third son
and favourite child, of Muhsin, and of Mahmid Yusuf.

On her husband’s death in 939H. (July, 1533), she
was banished by her stepson Rashid, and went with
her children to. Kabul where she met Haidar Mirza
and where she was under the protection of Kamran.

Gul-badan mentions her in the guest-list, and places
her name as present at the Mystic Feast (1581), but —
this can hardly be right. She could easily have been
at the marriage festivities in 1537.

CCI. Zainab-sultan Begam.

There is a difficulty in identifying the begam of this
name, whom Babar mentions (Mems., 887) as coming
to India. It will be seen by comparing the sources
and their French and English interpretations :

Mems., 387. ‘another, by name Zainab-sultan Begam, the

granddaughter of Bikeh Chicham.’

P. de C., II. 355. ‘et la petite-fille de Yenga-Tchetcham,

autrement dite Zeineb-sultan Begam.’

Zawinab-sultin Begam.

Ilminsky, Turki text, 447. yana, yanga chichim ki Zainab-

sultin Begam bilaghi’t nabira st kilab.

It seems safer to take Zainab as the name of Babayr’s
relation (i.¢., the yanga of his chicha) than as that of
the granddaughter (nabira).

It may be observed here that the best authorities
quoted above, i.e., Ilminsky, behind whom is Kehr,
and Or., 3714, have yanga where Mr. Erskine and
Elliot, 19, have bega. This exchange may occur in
the case of other begas of this appendix. Until a good
Turki text more complete than that in the B. M. is
found, this must be left an open question.

If Zainab be taken as the name of the yanga, she
may be identifiable with one of the other women already
entered in the appendix, but for deciding this point
more examples are necessary of Babar’s application of
the word yanga.

CCIII. Zuhra Begi and Agha Uzbeg.
Ar. zuhra, beauty, a yellow flower, the star Venus.

An inferior wife of Sultan Mahmud Mirza; mother
of Makhdima-sultan Begam and of Sultan ‘Ali Mirza.

She was married during the lifetime of Mahmitd’s
father, and therefore before Rajab 873H. (January,
1469), and was widowed Rabi II., 900H. (January,
1495). In 905H. (1499-1500) she entered into an
intrigue with Shaibani, a fellow-tribesman, of which
the ultimate aim was dominance in Samarqand for
her son ‘Ali. A part of her scheme and offer was her
own remarriage with Shaibani. Babar stigmatizes
her action as ‘stupidity and folly,’ and says, further,
‘the wretched and weak woman, for the sake of getting
herself a husband, gave the family and honour of her
son to the winds. Nor did Shaibani Khan mind her
a bit, or value her even so much as his other hand-
maids, concubines, or women. Sultan ‘Ali Mirza was
confounded at the condition in which he now found
himself, and deeply regretted the step he had taken.
Several young cavaliers formed a plan for escaping
with him, but he would not consent. As the hour of
fate was at hand, he could not shun it. They put
him to death in the meadow of Kulba. From his
overanxiety to preserve this mortal and transitory
life, he left a name of infamy behind him; and, from
following the suggestions of a woman, struck himself
out of the list of those who have earned for themselves
a glorious name. It is impossible to write any more
of the transactions of such a personage (? Zuhra), and
impossible to listen any further to the recital of such
base and dastardly proceedings.’ .

APPENDIX B.

Mahdi Khwaja.

Nizamu-d-din Ahmad has included in his T'abaqat-t-
.akbart a story which he heard from his father Muham-
mad Muqim Hardwi, and of which the purport is that
Babar’s Khalifa (Nizamu-d-din ‘Ali Barlds) had at one
time thought of placing a certain Mahdi Khwaja on
the throne in succession to Babar.

Two circumstances cast doubt on the story: (1) It
was customary in Babar’s family for a son to succeed
his father; (2) Babar left four sons, the youngest of
whom, Hindal, was eleven years old.

Moreover, there were Timurids both of the Bayqra
and Miran-shahi branches in India with Babar whose
claims to a Timurid throne would be strongly enforced.

But Nizimu-d-din Ahmad has left us the story in
circumstantial detail and it cannot be passed over
unnoticed, and this the less because Gul-badan Begam
throws some light on the identity of the Mahdi con-
cerned, and also because in an important particular,
t.e., the relation of Mahdi.to Babar, I am able, through
Mr. Beveridge’s study of the Habibu-s-siyar, to give
more accurate information than was at Mr. Erskine’s
disposal.

The story was old when Nizamu-d-din set it down
and it is not necessary to accept all its details as exact.
It is sufficient to consider its minimum contents which
are, that in the royal household there had been a
rumour of a plan of supersession of Babar’s sons by
Mahdi Khwaja at the instance of Khalifa.

The question naturally arises, who was the man


--- Page 328 ---
Courtesy www.pdfbooksfree.pk

299

concerning whom such intention could be attributed
to the wise and experienced Khalifa ?

Nizamu-d-din calls Mahdi Babar’s damad, and Mr.
Erskine, amongst other translators, has rendered this
by son-in-law. It is unnecessary to consider why any
Mahdi Khwaja known in history should have been
preferred to those sons-in-law who were of Babar’s
own blood, because Gul-badan calls Mahdi Babar’s
yazna. For this word the dictionaries yield only the
meaning of ‘brother-in-law’ and ‘husband of the
king’s sister.’ Both these meanings are also attributed
to damdd. But the Habib settles the verbal question
by a statement that Mahdi Khwaja was the husband
of Khan-zada Begam, Babar’s full sister.

It is not improbable that he had another close link
with the Emperor, namely that of relationship to Maham
Begam, but I am not yet able to assert this definitely.

Babar never mentions Mahdi Khwaja’s parentage.
This is learned from Khwand-amir who states that he
was the son of Musa Khwaja and grandson of Murtaza
Khwaja. He was a sayyid; and from the circumstance
that his burial-place was chosen as that of Sayyid
Abw’l-ma‘ali Termizt, it may be inferred that he
belonged to the religious house of Termiz. If so, he
had probably Timurid blood in his veins, since inter-
marriage between the families was frequent.

Babar mentions a Khwaja Musa who is perhaps
Mahdi’s father, in 914H., 1508. He immediately
afterwards names Khwaja Muhammad ‘Ali, Maham
Begam’s brother, in suggestive sequence.

Babar’s first surviving record of Mahdi is made in
925H. (February, 1519) when ‘Mir Muhammad Mahdi
Khwaja’ brings in a prisoner. It is in cir. 923H.
(1517) that Khwand-amir speaks of the marriage of
Mahdi and Khan-zada, but this is probably a good
deal after the fact, because Khan-zada was returned
to Babar in 917H. (1511).


--- Page 329 ---

Mahdi Khwaja, as Babar invariably calls him after
his first appearance, went to Hindustan with Babar and
is frequently mentioned. It is significant of his high

. position and presumably not only by marriage but by
birth, that on military duty he is always associated
with men of royal blood, either Timurid or Chaghatai.
He is sometimes given precedence of them, and is
never named last in a list of officers. Chin-timur
Chaghatai, Muhammad Sultan Mirza Bayqra, Sultan
Mirza Miran-shahi, and ‘Adil Sultan are constantly
associated with him. It seems clear that he was a
great noble and ranked amongst the highest. Khafi
Khan calls him Sayyid Khwaja, and so does Khwand-
amir. Whether the ‘Khwaja’ indicates anything as
to his mother’s marriage I am not able to say.

Khafi Khan (I. 42) has a passage which may relate
to him: Sulfan Mirza wa Mahdi Sultan bint a‘mamra
(of Babar) ki astr-i-an juma‘ biidand khalas sakht. The
date of the occurrence is cir. 1511, the year in which
another Mahdi, i.e., Uzbeg, was killed by Babar. Mr.
Erskine appears to think that the two men, named
here as released, were Hamza and Mahdi Sultans
Uzbeg, but the sources do not give the style of Mirza
to either of these chiefs. They appear to have had
marriage connections with Babar in an earlier genera-
tion, and a son of Mahdi seems to have been ‘Adil
Sultan (Mems., 863) who was father of ‘Aqil Sultan

Jzbeg (Akbar-nama, I. 221).

A Mahdi Khwaja who was undoubtedly of Babar’s
family, appears both in the Tarikh-i-rashidi and in
Gul-badan Begam’s Humdytin-nama. He is the son
of Aiman, and grandson of Sultan Ahmad Khan
Chaghatai, Babar’s mother’s brother. But his age
places him out of the question; he was about ten in
1580, and the hero of Nizamu-d-din’s story stroked
his beard, and was either a damdd or a yazna. Mahdi


--- Page 330 ---

301

Chaghatai, moreover, reached India after Babar’s
death.1

The Tabaqat states that Mahdi Khwaja had long
been connected with Khalifa; the latter was himselfa
sayyid.

Nizamu-d-din calls Mahdia jawan and Mr. Erskine
has accentuated all the faults and characteristics of
youth in his version of the story. But Gul-badan
calls Hindal an uninjurious youth at thirty-three, and
there seems good ground to read often in jawan the
notion of vigour and strength rather than exclusively
of fewness of years. In 1530 Mahdi had served Babar
eleven known years.

Like many other such small problems, that of the
family connections of Mahdi Khwaja and the other
men of his name may be solved by some chance
passage in a less known author, or by a closer con-
sideration of the personages of the Memoirs.

1 The rough estimate of Mahdi Chaghatidi’s age is made as follows:
Aiman was married to Haidar Mirza’s cousin in 923H. (1517). (Tar.
Rash., E. and R., 144, 352.) He had five sons by this wife. (l. c. 144
and 401). Of these Ma'sid is named as the eldest. The rest are
Khizr (Gul-badan’s husband) Mahdi, Isan-daulat ({fabiba’s husband),
and another. Khizr is inferentially the second son, but if Mahdi were
the second, he could hardly have been born before 926H. (1520). This
would make him about ten in 1530, but he may have been younger
and the third son, as is indicated by the enumeration of Haidar Mirza.

2 At p. 424 Mr. Erskine has an entry of a Sayyid Mahdi who arrives
from Gualiar in July, 1529. That this is a mis-reading for Mashhadi
is shown by collation with other texts than his own.

* (82,5) It seems to me that in binding the M.S. in India; fol. 83
has been misplaced and that it should follow at this point where its
contents are &@ propos. The catchwords are wanting on it and on 74a.

This emendation has been made only since the preparation of my
article on Gulbadan Begam (Calcutta Review, April 1898) and con-
tradicts and modifies some statements of that article.

The account of the journey to Laghman (fol. 83) is appropriate
here and is out-of-place in the story of Kamran’s blinding and of Hu-
mayiin’s subsequent movements.

It is possible that another page also is missing and that the quiet
singing was not on the road.

* (485) Ar. nags, an air with its variations. (Pavet de Courteille.)

* (Adu) This word occurs thrice in the M.S. i.e., at 22b (here),
at 26 b—in the plural—, and at 28b. It is written clearly and confidently.
Nothing like it has been yielded to our search by the Dictionaries.
Mr. Beveridge suggests (1) that it may be a corrupt and domestic form
of an Arabic word ‘alagaha’ which he finds as what may be termed
a corresponding word, in a description of the Peacock Throne and
from this we assume the “hangings” of the translation. Or (2) it
may be a corruption of the Turki asg? “tout qui est suspendu pour
ornement”. Zenker 58b.

** ((9) 2s) S9)y9%55 There are no points. Mr. A.G. Ellis has kindly
helped me with the suggestion I have accepted. The meaning of
Say9%53 is “feutre qui recowvre la tente”. (P. de C. Turki Dict. 237.)
As the lining of the festal tents is described in the preceding para-
graph, I have placed the second among the gifts. Vambéry trans-
lates the word: die obere Filzdecke des Zeltes. bs

## (oO Me) I suggest oN on the analogy of (poSS. One
looks for bason after ewer but the word following 4:l48\ cannot
be read as chilumchi or any other equivalent for bason which I can
find. Chilumchi, i. e. chilanchi occur at 72a and does not resemble
the doubtful word here rendered julabjan.

the prop were absent the word could be read ,3 3yb, taragq, ply, fold
i.e. sets. The sense of the two passages is, I think, that Maham
got together two sets of arms of which one included of those a
Mughal Commander.

* (dsl 593) Erskine (202n.) says “perhaps a space enclosed by a
low railing.” Chardin (Voyage en Perse) has a picture of a grandee
seated within an enclosure (at sides and back) which as he sits, ap-
pears to reach his shoulders. Perhaps this is a tur-khana. Zenker
describes it as a seat of honour of the nature of a throne. It would
supply a necessity of Indian life, if one might read taur, net, and
allow the royal author a mosquito-room.

* (Us)) Perhaps a sarcasm is intended by changing the title rand
into the epithet rd‘na—a foolish admirer of himself. Sanga is always
so stigmatized, but so too are other and friendly Rands. Cf. 48b.

** (p20) Text uncertain. The enemy came from the side which
from a military stand-point, was emphatically Hindi and also may
be said colloquially to have come from the direction of Mandi.

#%* (Sis) I am indebted to Mr. Beveridge for the interesting in-
formation in the following note. The ee (Venus) of the text is, he
believes, a mistake for jw, Sakkiz, eight, the Hight Stars being
regarded as unpropitious by Persians. Gul-badan has perhaps con-
fused the portents of a defeat by Shaibani at Khwaja Kardzin in
1501 and the battle of Khanwa in 1527. Babar’s statement about
Khanwa is that Sharif gave warning that Mars was in the west and
that whoever should come from the east, would be defeated.

Babar has a characteristic story of his having precipitated the fight
at Kardzin (1501) because the Eight Stars were exactly between the
opposing armies and if he had delayed, they would have favoured
Shaibani for 13 or 14 days. “These observances were all nonsense
and my precipitation was without the least solid excuse.” He lost
the battle. Cf. Steingass Pers. Dict. 689; Vullers II. 310a; Mems.
92, 353, 368.

** (AX) This word may" be atka or anaga and is to be explained
by the known ownership of the garden which was made by Babar’s
paternal uncle, Ulugh Beg. But for the undotted “prop”, it might
have been read as AS\ and as referring to Khan-zada Begam or Maham,
Babar’s wife, both of whom, as will be noticed, are styled aka
(jandm) and aka respectively. Cf. a use of ASS\ p. 28b.

+ (EX jab) Vambéry’s derivation of this multiform word, «Ozbeg,
his own master, independent” (History of Bokhara, 245) is at least
ben trovato and in congruity with the acts of the tribe. But several
careful writers, Blochmann amongst them, have chosen the form
Uzbak.

* (Jylee) Comparing this passage with A. F.’s parallel passage
(Bib. Ind. I. 67), we find a curious resemblance, e e. g. Cn biive es oly
—rols Bas » bali seal Eee boyassl as ex,

** Pavet de Courteille and Steingass render chapan by haillons and
ytattered garments”, Erskine (127 and n.) by “long frocks”. Vambéry
gives no chapan but chdpan, which he translates Oberrock and par-
dessus. Steingass has no chdpan.

il (39 be) The words of the next phrase present difficulty. The
sense is “with clubs in their hands”, and that this is so, is shewn by the
parallel passages from the Turki and Persian texts of Babar’s Memoirs.

29 Spb LER! Glal, 529 Usage ola! slat > Persian)
ob lis! gl4ses. The difficult words may be a Turki inter-
polation in Gul-badan’s text. The word which follows .39 be may
be read Suuhl leathern, but O99 yk includes the notion of leathern
and neither the Turki nor the Persian text uses any such qualifying
word. I propose to read the words as a Turki phrase —loyyY S|

bb 39>. It may be that when Gul-badan was writing she had her
Father 's book before her. Her close reproduction of his words points
to this or to intimate recollection of his words.

Copied from the British Museum Persian M.S. (Or. 166),
‘by Annette S. Beveridge.

* (sles obs) This title stands on the first page of the M.S. and on
paper like that of the M.S.. The page is numbered 15 in the Arabic
and 2 in the B.M. marking. The M.S. is numbered by folios, and
both with Arabic figures—inscribed in India—and with Roman, added
by the B.M.. This reproduction and the translation of the M.S. are
numbered in agreement with the Roman figures. A subdivision of
folios into pages (1a, 1b &e.) allows easier reference. One index serves
Sor both parts (Persian text and translation).

* (Note to slisol) This title is inscribed on the first Sty-leaf of the
volume containing the M.S. It is upon paper of colour and kind
differing from that of the M.S. and identical with four blank pages
bound up at the end of the volume, possibly with the intention of
writing up the missing terminal portion of the work.
