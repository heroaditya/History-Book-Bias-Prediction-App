PREFACE

THe Allacatend Fufeh of Amir Khusiau has often been referred to by
the Jater historians of India. Sir Sved Ahmad Khin nas quoted it in
the second volume of his Asdr-us-Sanadid and even Sir Henry Elliot
has noticed it in the third voiume of his /frsfery of India as teld by her
own Hrstorvians. But I doubt if in the six hundred years that have
elapsed since its author’s death any one has cared to study the work
with the care it deserves. Khusrauw’s immortal reputation as the
greatest of Indo-Persian poets, was founded essentially on his depth
of feeling, his lyric gift and his supremely attractive personelite.
Scholar, mystic, philosopher, poet, soldier and politician, few peaple
have been able to bring such diverse attributes together. It was the
same with his poetry. He composed verses in Arabic, Hind: and
Persian: and in the Persian language, to which the mass of his work
belongs, he tried his hands at every kind of verse and every form of
metre. He was a musician alse, and in one of the Hines quoted by
Daulat Shah in his Tazkiratu’sh Shu’ara, Khusrau claims that his
musical compositions, ‘if they could be written’, would be as
voluminous as his verses, Many poets of equal eminence have lived
in obscurity and want; but Khusrau was born to fame and had no
difficulty in obtaining recognition from his contemporaries,  Ziuuddin
Barni, the historian, who knew Kbhusrau well, dectared him te be ‘the
greatest of all poets, ancient and miedern; for whereas other poets had
excelled in one or two forms of verse—the gif’, the eaddé, the
ghacal, the ruéa'i, or the masnazi—Khusrau was pre-eminent in all.
Khusrau's carcer was, moreover, as sustained as it wis successful,
He teran his life as a courtier of Malik Chajju Vaghrish Nhan, nephew
of Sultin Ghiisuddin Balban. Jalhinddin Rhiiii appointed him
officer of the empire, Wesfefder (Quran keeper’ and courtier—in fact.
poet Jaureate—on his accession in 129: and in spite of all revelutions
and dynastic changes, Khusraun held this oMce dil his death in

1325 A.D.
Rivsraw's prolific works include four Jfndeq five metriccl
romunces, five historical romances and two prose works. ‘Two othe:

Hindi-Persian vocabulary, and a brief summary of the conversations
of Shaikh Nizdmuddin Aulii in simple and lucid prose. No Indo-
Muslim writer has done more to provide livelihood for the poor
copyists (Aatibs) of the middle ages; voluminous though his works are,
posterity has preserved them with scdulous care; and apart from the
Khaliq Bart and the Zughlag Nama (which Khusrau did not live to
revise and complete), they have survived in fairly good condition.
Along with the rest, the Avhasain'ul /uffih has also been transcribed
and retranscribed, though its form and contents were both calculated
to drive away the ‘gentle reader’ who did not bring to his task 2
grave sense of duty and an irrepressible desire to unearth all historic
facts, regardless of the time and Inbour the search might entail. Its
manuscripts are not scarce, and as the text would have lost its value
in the hands of a careless copyist, due care seems to have been always
‘taken in transcribing it. The real difficulties of the Persian language
apart, there are hardly three or four places where it is not possible to
put the text right.

The present translation based on the Yule manuscript in the
British Museum, was begun and completed by me in the year 1920-21,
when, along with my friends, Mr. Abdur Rahman Siddiqi and
Mr. Shuaib Qureshi, 1 was working as a research student under the
supervision of Dr. D. S. Margoliouth at Oxford. The Yule manuscript
is obviously a modern work and belongs to the early cighteenth
century, but a note at the end of the text declares that ‘the original
from which this manuscript has been copied was written eleven years
after Amir Khusrau’s death.” On my return to India, my friend
Mr. Hasan Barni (Advocate, Bulandshahr) placed at my disposal
a modern copy of the work which he had got transcribed for
himself. I revised the translation with the help of my senior pupils,
Mr. S. A. Rashid, Mr. Moinul Haq and Mr. Sultan Hameed. We did
not find any substantial difference between the two manuscripts.

The difficulty of translating a book of ornate Persian like the
Khazdin ul Futah can only be appreciated by those who have under-
taken similar work. As I look back at the wearisome days and
sleepless nights the prosecution of this work has entailed, I cannot
help being grateful for the kind and ungrudging help of my revered
teacher, Dr. D. S. Margoliouth. Many passages of the translation
have been revised by him, and, though the responsibility for the


--- Page 13 ---
vil

defects is entirely mine, the completion of the task would not have
been possible without his guidance and advice. It has been my
privilege to sit at the feet of such a master.

In dividing the work into chapters and paragraphs, I have, so far
as possible, followed Khusrau’s own Jead. In the manuscript the
paragraphs and chapter headings, mostly in verse, are written in red
ink. Most paragraphs have also been given a verse-heading to tell
the reader what allusion and similes he is to look for; I have trans-
ferred these verse-headings to the footnotes. Translation of Persian
verses has throughout been put in italics.

I have tried to make the translation as accurate as possible and in
the attempt to be accurate, I have tried to be as literal as the different
forms and traditions of the English and the Persian languages permit,
But a Hteral translation sometimes gives to the English reader an
impression which the author never intends, and in such cases I have
considered it my duty to translate the ideas of the author rather than
his words. It must also be confessed that a number of Khusrau’s
verbal tricks or ‘ miracles ’, puns on words and letters, and scholastic
allusions, are absolutely untranslatable, and no good purpose would
have been served by a very clumsy translation buttressed by wearisome
and uninteresting footnotes. Some of these ‘ miracles’ have perforce
been omitted, while | have attempted to translate the rest in such
manner as was possible. One of the good points of Khusran’s work
is the plentiful dates it contains, In the Persian text, the date is first
embodied in a chronogram and is then explained in a simple verse
which gives the day, month and year. I have omitted the chronogram
and merely translated the date.

Iam grateful to Dr. S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar for his scholarly
introduction on the historical aspects of the work. The literary
character of the Ahasain’ul Fufak was examined by me in the
Introduction to my friend, Mr. Moinul Haq’s edition of the Persian
text. Itis transcribed here for the reader of the English translation :-—

‘Poetry was Amir husrau’s mother-tongue; prose he wrote with
difficulty and effort and he would have been well advised to Teave that
region of literature to more pedestrian intellects. But it was not to
be expected that such a consideration would serve to check his
exuberant genius. Apart from the introductions to his Ofuses, two
of his prose-works, differing in volume and value, Wave survived,

The Grst, /’j@e-2-Khusrav? (Miracles of Khusrau) is a long work in
five volumes on figures of speech. It contains every variety of
miracle known to the penmen of the age—petitions to high officers
composed of vowels only, verses which are Persian if read from right
to left, and Arabic if read from left to right, compositions from which
all letters with dots are excluded, and many such artificialities of wit
and style which may have delighted and consoled the author’s con-
temporaries, but fail to attract our modern taste. Some of the letters
included in the volumes have a solid historical value. An application
to a government officer requesting for a post or complaining against
the misbehaviour of neighbours was sure to attract attention if drafted
by Khusrau; and the poet was too inventive not to have a new
‘miracle’ ready for every occasion. It is easy to understand that
supplicants flocked to his door.* He seems also to have beguiled his
leisure hours in discovering new literary tricks and often sent them as
presents to his friends. The /’7@z-2-Khusravi is the accumulated mass
of these miraculous prose compositions which Amir Khnsrau had
been amassing for years and edited in the Jater part of Aiauddin’s
reign. Most of the pieces are tiresome and frivolous, but others
throw a brilliant light on the social life of the day. Amir Khusrau’s
second prose-work, the Akasdin'ul Fulah is the official history of
Alauddin’s campaigns.

‘Amir Khusrau was a man of wit and humour. His fancies are
often brilliant. Nevertheless nothing but a stern sense of duty will
induce a modern reader to go through Khusrau’s prose-works in the
original. His style is artificial in the extreme; the simijies and
metaphors are sometimes too puerile for a school-boy ; at other places
the connecting link between the ideas (if present at all) is hard to
discover. Prose is the natural speech of man for ordinary occasions,
but Amir Khusrau’s ideas seem to have come to him in a versified
form. So while his poetry has all the beauties of an excellent prose,
his prose has all the artificiality of very bad verse; it is jejune, insipid,
tasteless and wearisome.

‘Failing to realise that the true beauty of prose lies in its being
simple, direct and effective, he tries to surprise his readers by a new

own mental power and in this, so far as contemporaries were concerned,
he certainly succeeded. But Amir chusrau, for all his artistic talents,
never comprehended that a book of prose, like a volume of verse,
should be a thing of beauty and of joy.

‘The Atkacara’ul Fufak very well illustrates the general character
of Khusrau’s prose. It is divided into small paragraphs; every
paragraph has a heading informing the reader what allusions he js
going to find in the next few lines. A single example will suffice.
“ silfestons foceater. TE the stream of my ife was given the good news
of elernal existence, even then T would not offer the ¢Airséy any drink
except the praises of the Second ¢i/erender’. But as I find that
human ?/rfe is such that in the end we have to wuas4 our hands off it, the
fountatn of words will only enable the reader to moisten his lips.
Since the achievement of my life-time, from the cradle to the grave,
cannot be more than this, I did not think it proper to Aln-re to the
bottom of endless oreans, but have contented myself with a small
quantity of the wefer of df.’ And so it goes on, wearisome and
artificial, from beginning to end. oo

‘It is obvious that such a procedure detracted much from the value
of an historical work. Only such facts could be stated as permitted
Khusrau to bring in the allusion; the rest could be only partially
stated or had to be suppressed; Khusrau’s only resource was to make
his paragraphs as small as possible, otherwise his prose would have
marched along routes quite different from those selected by Uiuddin's
generals. The reader, who wishes to discover the true historical fact,
has first to analyse Khusrau's literary tricks and critically separate the
element of fact from the colouring imparted to it by Khusrau in order
to bring in the allusions. At times the Htcrary tricks induces us to
ignore the fact at the bottom. “ AMuston fo eivdue and vier—Though

wine on her part, has washed herself with salt and sworn that she will
henceforth remain in the form of vinegar, freeing herself from all
evils out of regard for the claims of sa/t.’")

‘This would have appeared a mere literary flourish if we had not
been definitely told by Ziauddin Barni, that Alauddin carried through
a series of harsh measures for the suppression of drinking in Delhi.
Conversely, the allusion may have no basis of fact at all. ‘' Allusions
fo sea and ratn—The sword of the righteous monarch completely
conquered the province (Gujrat), Much d/ood was shed. A general
jnvitation was issued to all the beasts and birds of the forest to a
continuous feast of meat and drink. Inthe marriage banquet, at which
the Hindus were sacrificed, animals of all kinds ate them to their
satisfaction.” This would seem to indicate a general and intentional
massacre. But there was no such massacre, and Khusrau himself goes
on to assure us: ‘' My object in this simile is not real blood but (only to
show) that the sword of Islam purified the land as the sun purifies the
earth.” The Ahazcain'ul Fulith has to be interpreted with care, and in
the light of other contemporary material, it would be dangerous and
misleading to accept Khusrau’s accounts at their face value. Still the
labour of interpretation is well repaid by the new facts we discover.

‘The Kharain'ul Futih naturally falls into six parts—the introduc-
tion, administrative reforms and public works, campaigns against the
Mongols, the conquest of Hindustan, the campaign of Warangal and
the campaign of Ma’bar. The space devoted to the various sections
is surprisingly unequal. About two-third of the book is devoted to
the Warangal and Ma’bar campaigns, while the other measures of
Alauddin’s reign are summarized in the remaining third. The reason
for this is, perhaps, not impossible to discover. A remark of Barni
(Tarikh-i-Firoz-Shahi, page 361) seems to throw light on the real
character of the Adazain'ul Fuffh as well as the Zarzhh-i-Feroz-Shahi.
“The other great historian of the time (of Sultan Alauddin) was
Kabiruddin, son of Tajuddin Iraqi. In the art of composition, elo-
quence andadvice, he exceeded his own and Alauddin’s contemporaries,
and became the Amir-i-dad-i lashkar in place of his revered father.
He was held in great honour by Alauddin. He has displayed wonders

in Arabic and Persian prose. In the Fath-2 Nama (Book of Victory)
which consists of several volumes, he does honour to the traditions of
prose and seems to surpass all writers, ancient and modern. But of
all the events of Alauddin’s reign, he has confined himself to a
narration of the Sultan’s conquests; these he has praised with
exaggeration and adorned with figures of speech, and he has departed
from the tradition of those historians who relate the good as well as
the bad actions of every man. And as he wrote the history of
Alauddin during that Sultan’s reign and every volume of it was
presented to the Sultan, it was impossible for him to refrain from
praising that terrible king or to speak of anything but his greatness.”

‘So Amir Khusrau, though the poet-laureate, was not the court-
historian of Alauddin Khilji; that honour belonged to Kabiruddin
who was considered to be the greatest prose writer of the day. The
official history by which Alauddin expected to be remembered by
posterity was not the thin volume of Amir Khusrau but the ponderous
Fath-t Nama which was prepared under the Sultan’s personal supervi-
sion. The Fath-2 Nama has disappeared; its manuscripts may have
been intentionally destroyed during Timur’s invasions or under the
early Moghul Emperors, for it must have been full of contempt and
hatred for the Mongol barbarians! ; Ferishta and other Jater historians
do not refer to it and its great length would, in any case, have made
its preservation difficult. But Barni and Khusrau had the Fath-i Nama
before them and accommodated their histories to it. Barni, who was
essentially a man of civil life, allowed Kabiruddin to speak of
Alduddin’s conquests, and confined his own history to an account of
administrative and political affairs, merely adding a paragraph on the
campaigns here and there for the logical completeness of his work.
Amir Khusrau was more ambitious. He pitted himself against
Kabiruddin’s great, if transient, reputation and on Kabiruddin’s own
chosen ground. Hitherto his pen, ‘like a tire-woman, had generally
curled the hair of her maidens in verse,’ but it would now bring
‘** pages of prose for the high festival.” Let not critics dismiss him as
a mere poet, living in a mock paradise and incapable of describing the

volume of Bathagi, the Autobiography of Mohammad bin Tughlag and the last
chapter of Afif’s Tarikh-i-Firoz-Shahi, which was a violent attack on Timur and

affairs of government and war, If he had wings to fly, he had also
feet to walk. He would even surpass Kabiruddin, whom shallow
critics considered “ the greatest of all prosaists, ancient and modern.”
He would excel in all that Kabiruddin had excelled. The four
virtues (or defects) which Barni deploringly attributes to Kabiruddin
are all painfully present in Khusrau’s work—an artificial style adorned
with figures of speech, an exclusive devotion to wars and conquests,
the elimination of all facts that were not complimentary to Alauddin,
and, lastly, an exaggerated flattery of the Sultan. In the Panj Gunj
Khusrau had imitated the Ahamsah of Nizimi and walked as far as
possible in his predecessor’s foot-steps. It was a mistake, but he
repeated it once more in the A’hazdin’ul Fulih. We do not see
Khusrau’s prose in its natural dress; it is draped and disfigured into
an imitation of Kabiruddin’s extinct composition. For Amir Khusran,
if a scholar, was also a courtier, and a courtier is devoted to the
fashion of the passing hour. The fashion had been set by Kabiruddin
and his predecessors, Khusrau blindly followed it.

‘The Ahazdin'ul Futih is not merely achallenge to the Fath-i
Nama of Kabiruddin; it is also a continuation of that work. Barni
seems to imply that Kabiruddin was a survivor from the preceding age
and he may not have lived to complete his voluminous work. If so,
the disproportionate length of the Deccan campaigns in the Aharain'ul
Fulah becomes intelligible, The Ahardin’ul Futth is essentially a
history of the Deccan invasions. Alauddin may have asked Khusrau
to continue Kabiruddin’s work, but Khusrau’s introductory remarks
make it probable that he wrote on his own initiative and expected the
Sultan to accept it as the official account of the reign. The Fath-z
Nama had made a detailed description of the earlier events unneces-
sary, and Khusrau merely summarises them to enable his book to
stand on its own feet. But the Deccan campaigns are given in detail,
probably after the manner of the extinct Faf/-7 Nama.

‘Amir Khusrau wished his work to be an official account of
Alauddin’s reign and the Mhazain’ul Fulah has, consequently, all the
merits and defects of a government publication. It credits Alauddin
with every variety of virtue and power, and his officers also come in
for their due share. All governments live on lies or, at least, a
partial suppression of truth. But Amir Khusrau’s hyperbolic ex-
aggerations are less deceptive and dangerous than the insidious


--- Page 19 ---
propaganda of modern governments. His flattery neither deceived
nor was intended to deceive; it was simply a current fashion and
nobody attached any significance to such words. Exaggeration is not
a commendable habit, but understand it as a habit and it will no longer
veil the true meaning of the author.

‘Ziauddin Barni complains that Kabiruddin simply confined
himself to those events which were creditable to Alauddin. This is
certainly true of Khusrau’s work. He will not utter a lie but neither
will he speak ‘! the truth and the whole truth’’. On the 16th Ramzan,
695 (July 9, 1296 a.p.) Sultan Jalaluddin was assassinated on the
bank of the Ganges by the order of Alauddin Khilji, who was the
Governor of Karra. It was an atrocious murder but Amir Khusrau
simply ignores it. “As Providence had ordained that this Muslim
Moses was to seize their powerful swords from all infidel Pharoahs
.-.. he mounted the throne on Wednesday, 16th Ramzan, 695 a.H.”
What else was there to say. He was not brave enough to defend his
murdered patron nor mean enough to blacken his character after his
death. He simply turned away his eyes. Similar omissions strike us
in the chapter on the Mongols. Nothing is said of the campaigns in
which Alauddin’s armies were defeated. The Mongols twice besieged
Delhi and Alauddin’s position was extremely critical! But Khusrau
has not even indirectly alluded to these momentous events. We are
able to make up for some of the omissions with the help of Barni and
other historians, but it is difficult to be certain that all the gaps have
been filled up.

‘In spite of these serious shortcomings, the Khazain'ul Fatih is
for the critical student, a book of solid worth. Amir Khusrau
exaggerates and we can make allowance for his exaggerations. He
leaves blanks which other historians enable us to fill up. But he is
too honest and straightforward to speak a lie, and we can safely rely
upon his word. He is exact in details and dates and enables us to
make a fairly complete chronology of Alauddin’s reign.? In spite of
the artificiality of his style, his descriptions have vivid touches of an

1%n the first invasion, the Mongols were led by Kutlugh Khwaja and in the
second by Targhi. Barni, who is brief and hasty in his account of wars, givesa
detailed account of the two sieges of Delhi, probably because Kabiruddin and
Amir Khusrau had preferred to be silent about them.

2 Barni, our standard historian for the period, is very parsimonious and
incorrect in dates.

eye-witness. Asa soldier he felt quite at home in military affairs, in
the construction of siege-engines and the tactics of the battle-field.
A careful examination of the Khazain’ul Futak will enable us to obtain
a fairly good idea of the art of war in the early middle ages. EEven
where he tells us nothing new, he serves to confirm the accounts of
others. He did not sit and brood inacorner. He mingled with the
highest and the greatest in the land, and when he took up his pen, it
was to write with a first hand knowledge of affairs. The sections on
the Deccan campaigns are a permanent contribution to Indian
historical literature. Nor is the element of romance absent, whatever
we may think of the motives of the invaders, long and heroic marches
across ‘paths more uneven than a camel’s back,’’ temples plundered,
Rajas subdued and the hoarded wealth of centuries brought at a
sweepstake to the terrible Sultan of Delhi. It was a mad dance of
rapine, ambition and death. “The Hindu vawats came riding in
troops but wete laid low before the Turkish horses. A deluge of
water and blood flowed forward in order to plead for mercy before the
Caliph’s troops. Or, yout may have said that owing to the great
happiness of the infidel souls, the beverage of blood was so delicious
that every time the cloud rained water over it, the ferocious earth
drank it up with the greatest pleasure. But in spite of the great
intoxicating power of this wine, the saqgZ poured her clear liquid out of
the flagon of the sky to increase its intoxication further. Out of this
wine and beverage Death had manufactured her first delicious draught.
Next you saw bones on the Earth.”

‘If Amir Khusrau had been writing in the age of the Puranas, he
would have represented Alauddin as an incarnation of Vishnu and de-
scribed his opponents as malicious demons. Thatis how the Aryans
blackened the character of their enemies and justified their aggression.
A modern writer would have to white-wash the same cruelties by talking
of liberty, justice, the duty of elevating backward races and, with
solemn unconscious htrmour, advanced the most humane arguments to
justify the inhumanities of war. But Amir Khusrau was not a hypo-
crite ; he saw life through plain glasses and the traditions of his day
made hypocrisy unnecessary. The Deccan expeditions had one clear
object—the acquisition of horses, elephants, jewels, gold and silver.
Why tell lies? The Mussalmans had not gone there ona religious
mission ; they had neither the time nor the inclination to enrol converts

and they were too good soldiers to let irrelevant considerations disturb
their military plans. Of course the zeme of God was solemnly pro-
nounced. The invaders built mosques wherever they went and the
call to prayer resounded in many a wilderness and many a desolated
town. This was their habit. Of anything like an idealistic, even a
fanatic, religions mission the Deccan invasions were completely
innocent. ‘

‘ But it would be a serious mistake to interpret the political move-
ments of those daysin the light of modern national feeling or the
religious enthusiasm of the early Saracens. The fundamental social
and political principle of the Middle ages was loyalty to the salt. It
overrode all racial, communal and religious considerations. The
Raja’s Muslim servants followed him against the Sultan just as the
Sultan’s Hindu servants followed him against the Raja; neither felt
any inner contradiction between their religion and their life. Loyalty
to the salt (zamak halali) was synonymous with patriotism ; disloyalty
to the salt (vamak hardmiz) was a crime blacker than treason. Irra-
tional as the principle may seem, it prevented communal friction and
worked for peace. Conversely, for the ruler all his subjects stood
on an equal footing. The Hindu subjects of a neighbouring Raja were
the proper and inviting objects of a holy war. But not so the Sultan’s
own Hindu subjects. They were under his protection and his pros-
perity depended upon their prosperity. Learned writers may call them
simmis (payers of tribute) in books of religious law. But men of
practical affairs knew the ground they stood on and the power of the
mass of the people. The temples in the Sultan’s dominions were per-
fectly safe. ‘It is not permissible to injure a temple of long standing”’
was the fafzwa (judgment) of a Qaziin the reign of Sikandar Lodi, and
it undoubtedly expresses medieval Muslim sentiment on the matter.
The Sultan could prohibit the building of a new temple or mosque,
though, apart from occasion] vagaries, the right was rarely exercised ;
but the destruction of a standing temple is seldom, if ever, heard of.
It was, however, different with a temple standing in the dominion of
another ruler ; it had no Imperial guarantee to protect it and could be
plundered with impunity, because its devotees were not the Sultan’s
subjects and their disloyalty and sufferings could do him no harm.
The outlook of the age was essentially secular. Religion was a war
ery and nothing more,


--- Page 22 ---

‘A superficial reader‘of the Khazdin’ul Fufih might be inclined to
think it inspired by bigotry and fanaticism. But this would be a
serious error. Amir Khusrau's religious outlook was singularly
tolerant; an examination of his Dézwans can leave no other impression
on the critic’s mind. Even in the most bitter expressions of the
Khacainul Futith, there is a veiled suggestion, Of what? “So the
temple of Somnath was made to bow towards the Holy Mecca, and as
the temple lowered its head and jumped into the sea, you may say the
building first said its prayers and then had a bath. The idols, that
had fixed their abode midway to the House of Abraham (Mecca) and
way-laid stragglers, were broken to pieces in pursuance of Abraham's
traditions. But one idol, the greatest of them all, was sent by the
maliks to the Imperial Court, so that the breaking of their helpless god
may be demonstrated to the idol-worshipping Hindus.’’ ‘' They saw
a building (the temple of Barmatpuri) old and strong as the infidelity
of Satan, and enchanting like the allurements of worldly life. You
might say it was the Paradise of Shadad, which after being lost, those
hellites had found, or that it was the golden Lanka of Ram. . .. The
foundations of this golden temple, which was the ‘holy-place’ of the
Hindus, were dug up with the greatest care. The glorifiers of God
broke the infidel building, so that ‘spiritual birds’ descended down
like pigeons from the air. The ‘ears’ of the wall opened at the
sound of the spade. At its call the sword also raised its head from
the scabbard, and the heads of Brahmans and idol-worshippers came
dancing to their feet at the flashes of the sword. The golden bricks
rolled down and brought with them their plaster of sandal-wood; the
yellow. gold became red with blood and the white sandal turned
scarlet. The sword flashed where the jewels had once been spark-
ling ; where mire used to be created by rose water and musk, there
was now a mud of blood and dirt; the saffron-coloured doors and walls
assumed the colour of bronze; the stench of blood was emitted by
ground once fragrant with musk. And at this smell the men of Faith
Were intoxicated and the men of Infidelity ruined.”

‘Is this the trumpet-call of an aggressive and bloated fanaticism
or the excruciating melody of the tragic muse? Was Amir Khusrau
praising the idol-breakers or bewailing their lack of true faith? It
must not be forgotten that a courtier presenting an official history to
the Sultan had no freedom either of opinion or speech; and Amir


--- Page 23 ---
xvii

Khusrau emphatically expresses his willingness to recast’ his book
according to the Sultan’s wishes. But as Mohammed ibn-i Khawend
Shah (Mirkhond), the author of Rauzaius Safa, remarks: “ the official
historian should by hints, insinuations, overpraise and such other
devices as may come to hand, never fail to express his true opinion,
which, while remaining undetected by his illiterate patron, is sure to
be understood by the intelligent and the wise.” Amir Khusrau had no
liking for Malik Naib Kafur-i Sultani whom he abuses in the
Dewal Rani, and his keen sense for the religious and poetic elements
in life could not but revolt against the senseless vandalism of the
Deccan campaigns. Hence the ghastly realism of his sketches. He
may, or may not, have wept tears of blood over the fall of an ancient
civilization; but his mode of expression leaves little doubt that the
greed of gain and not the service of the Lord was the inspiring motive
of the invaders. One thing alone was clear after the day of stormy
battle: ‘ You saw bones on the Earth.’

INTRODUCTION

BY

Rao Bawapur Dr. S. Krisunaswas1 AIYANGAR, M.A., Ph.D.,
M.R.A.S., F.R.HIST.S., F-A.S.B.

Tan Khazain'ad Fulah of Amir Khusrau, of which the following pages
contain a more ot less complete translation by Professor Md. Habib
of the Muslim University, Aligarh, is perhaps historically the most
important work of Amir Khusrau. As Professor Habib points out in
the course of the translation itself, and in a life of Amir Khusrau
written by him and published by Messrs. Taraporevala Sons & Co.,
Bombay, the Khazcain'ul Fulith is a prose work of a rather peculiar
character. Khusrau finds his nataral element in poetry, and the
writing of prose to him was a work of effort; and, as in the case of the
Sanskrit writer Bana, this prose composition is a four de force intended
to exhibit the literary strength of the author, rather than one intended
to give pleasure to the reader as a work of art, or to convey
information in an easily understandable form. As a work of history
therefore, it might seem at first sight to be of comparatively less value
than works of a similar character by other authors in - Persian.
Allowing for all the drawbacks that its literary character carries along
with it, the work of Professor Habib exhibits it still as a valuable
source of history much as recent research has done in respect of the
flarshacharita ot Bana.

There is another defect in this work of Amir Khusrau from the
point of view of the student of history. Like so much else that we
are possessed of in Indian literature, this work belongs to the class of
panegyrics intended for the eye and the ear of the patron whose
achievements form the subject of the composition. It has to dwell
naturally upon the creditable achievements of the patrons concerned,
and pass lightly over that which is not exactly to the glory of the
hero. This, of course, would naturally make it very defective as a
historical composition pure and simple. But even so, while it may be
dangerous to draw inferences from the silence of the author in regard
to particulars, it could still contain much that is of value, sometimes


--- Page 25 ---
xix

even of very high value, in what it does actually state explicitly. As
the learned Professor points out, there are very prominent omissions
in this work, such as the invasions of the Mughals, which reached the
capital and made its position one for great anxiety. Such events are
passed over; and so similarly a few others of the incidents in the
reign of Allauddin are barely alluded to or even completely passed
over, as Professor Habib takes occasion to point out in his notes.
Notwithstanding these defects, the comparison instituted by Professor
Habib in the course of his notes shows that the presentation of
historical material in the work is all to the advantage of Amir
Khusrau’s composition which seems really to have been the source
from which later historians, including even Amir Khusrau’s younger
contemporary Barni, largely drew. While in particulars these later
works serve the purpose of illuminating commentaries on various
parts of the Akazdin’ul Futith, yet in respect of several of the
important historical events described, correctness and_ historical
probability seem to lie undoubtedly with Amir Khusrau. The work
thus forms typical of a class, not merely of Persian but of Indian
works generally, from which historical material of the highest value
can be drawn by a careful, critical scholar, notwithstanding the
peculiar literary features which make them fall short of being pure
history.

It is hardly necessary in this introduction, for which I am indebted
to Professor Habib’s esteem and personal regard for me, that I should
be traversing the field already so well covered by him. I might take
advantage of it to consider the details of the southern campaigns in
particular, which remained obscure till within recent times, and which
I took it upon myself to expound, with the imperfect material at my
disposal at the time, in my Lectures to the University of Madras, on
South India and Her Muhammadan Invaders, Lectures 3 and 4. This
work, Khazdin'ul Futih was then available only in the abridged
translation given in volume III of Elliot’s Astory of India as told by
her own Historians. A comparative reading would indicate the
corrections made by Professor Habib, and there is the additional
advantage of having the whole work before us in an excellent edition
by the learned Professor. Without undervaluing Elliot’s work in the
slightest degree, we may say that there aré numbers of places in which
the work of Sir Henry Elliot needed amendment.

Amir Khusrau devotes the first two chapters to the accession and
the administrative acts of the reign of Allauddin, and, as the Professor
has pointed out, he has no word to say in condemnation of the
atrocious deed by which Allauddin ascended the throne. But all
praise is given to Allfuddin for the administrative measures, several
of which do deserve praise from the point of view of the good results
produced. In respect of the Mughal invasions, the same shortcoming
appears, as is pointed out. It is the invasions that redounded to the
credit of Allauddin and his generals that are described in detail in
chapter III. Those that are likely to be Jess creditable are barely
alluded to, or passed over completely. Chapter IV is devoted to the
conquest of Western Hindustan, Rajaputana, Maiva and Gujarat, and
as a next step forward, the invasion of Deogiri. Chapter V is devoted
to the campaign of Arangal (Warangal), and chapter VI the campaign
in Ma’bar with which this work of Amir Khusrau is brought to a close.
As a matter of fact more than half the work is devoted to the two
southern invasions, the invasions of Arangal and Ma’bar, and it may
be said that they constitute the primary episodes in this epic of
Alliuddin’s. Even Barni, whose account is by far the most useful
and the most valuable so far, suffers somewhat from the want of
details, as Barni was not anxious to dilate upon the wars and
conquests of Allauddin. It is this work, and we may almost say
practically this work alone, that gives a detailed description of these
invasions and provides a satisfactory scheme of chronology without
which the campaigns can hardly be understood. In the campaigns
described in chapter [V against the four places, Gujarat, Rajaputana,
Malva and Deogiri, the account given in the Khazain’n! Futth is
supplemented by what is found in the Dawal Ran? of Amir Khusrau
himself, and by passages translated from the recently published text
of Barni. This makes the account as complete and satisfactory as, in
our present position with regard to the historical material available,
we are entitled to expect. The invasion of Deogiri, and the putting
of Ram Deo under tribute as a result of the invasion, the capture of
the Gujarat princess Dawal Devi are all described, and the episode is
concluded with the restoration of Ram Deo to his territory with
pethaps something added to it, as indicating the initiation of what
may be regarded as a new policy by Allauddin of maintaining Hindu
rulers in their position, provided they agreed to remain under tribute

to the empire. The invasion of Arangal therefore can now be under-
taken with the certainty that, in Deogiri, there was a staunch ally,
who could be depended upon for such support and assistance as may
be required by the invading army.

The army of invasion left Delhi for Warangal on the 25th Jamadiul
Awwal 709 a.H., corresponding to Friday, October 31, 1309. After
nine days’ march, the invading army arrived ata place called Masud-
pur on the 6th Jamadius Sani, corresponding to Monday, Novem-
ber 19, or Tuesday the llth according as we take the week-day or
the date as the correct one. The march lay through uneven country
of mountains and hills, full of brambles and bushes. In fact it had to
thread its way through a forest country. After six days of such
marching, crossing five rivers, Jun, Chambal, Kunwari, Binas and
Bhoji at the fords, the army arrived at Sultanpur, otherwise called
Irijpur, where it halted for four devs. It broke camp again on the
19th of the Jam&adius Sani, corresponding to Monday, November
24, 1309, and it had to pass through mountainous country again and
through rough roads. After thirteen days of arduous marching, the
army arrived at Khanda on the Ist Rajab (Sth December 1309),
Here a muster of the army was taken lasting fourteen days. They
apparently stayed there longer; the month of God, as it was called,
was spent there in camp, and the camp broke Iate in the month as
Amir Khusrau says, the morning ‘after the fast of Mary’. Again it
had to march through rivers and forests and the great river Narmada
itself had to be crossed. Bight days after crossing the Narmada, the
army reached a place called Nilkanth on the border of Deogiri, the
territory of Ram Deo. They made a halt of two days in the place to
make enquiries as to the most convenient route by which to march
onwards to Warangal. The march beganon the 26th Rajab, corre-
sponding to Wednesday, December 31, 1309, or Tuesday the 30th.
It again was a march of sixteen days through difficult roads. They
had not yet come to the country of Tilang. They were still on the
road to Tilang according to Amir Khusrau. They arrived at the end
of their arduous journey at a doab within the borders of which was
Basiragarh. ‘This is described as enclosed betwen two rivers Yashar
and Buji. A diamond mine is said to have existed here. From here
Malik Kafiir, at the head of a body of select horse marched against the
fort of Sarbar, which belonged to the kingdom of Tilang. This fort


--- Page 28 ---
xxii

offered stout resistance, and was not taken till the defenders performed
the rite of jazhar and offered desperate defence. This was ultimately
overcome, and a brother, Axzavir, of the chief was put in charge of the
fort. Apparently the rest of the army had joined by now, and the
march was resumed on Saturday, the 10th of Sha‘ban, corresponding to
Tuesday, January 1310, if the 10th of Sha‘ban is taken as correct, or
Saturday, the 7th if Saturday is to be taken as correct, and on the 16th
of the month the army arrived at the village called Kiinarbal. An
advance party of a thousand cavalry was sent forward to make a
reconnaissance and capture some from whom information could be got.
From Amir Khusrau's description Kinarbal must have been quite
close to Warangal as, after getting some information, the whole army
was able to occupy the hill of Anamkonda from which they could see
the ‘gardens of Arangal’. A camp was erected for the army on the
15th of Sha‘ban in front of the fort, and arrangements were made for
laying siege to the fortitself. Hach /»a (division of a ten thousand)
of the army was assigned 12 hundred yards round the Fort, and,
according to Amir Khusrau, the total circumference of the fort was
12,546 yards. This wonld mean that the invading army was over
100,000 in number. After a difficult siege lasting for a considerable
period of time with night attacks and counter attacks, the enemy was
overcome, and the outer fort was taken after effecting a breach 100
yards wide. On Tuesday, the 11th Rajab, the storming attack began.
On Sunday, the 13th Rajab, really Sunday, February 14, 1310, an
impression was made tpon the mud walls and by the following
Wednesday the mud wall was broken through and the inner fort was
in tarn besieged. While this siege was in progress, Rai Ludder Dev
(Prataparudra Deva II) sent to offer terms, and the terms were
accepted. After taking a very large amount of treasure given by the
Raja together with the elephants, horses and such other war
equipment, the Raja was put under tribute in accordance with the
instructions of Allauddin, and the invading army could now return.
The return march began on 16th Shawwél, corresponding to Thursday,
March 19, 1310, and turned homewards towards the capital. The
whole of the month Zil Hijja, the month following Shawwail, is said to ,
have been spent in crossing extensive forests. On the 11th of the
following month, Muharram a.u. 710, the army reached Delhi. This
would be Wednesday, the 10th of June 1310, the total return march


--- Page 29 ---

having occupied therefore two months and 25 days. Allduddin held a
great durbar in Chautr-i-Nasiri on Tuesday, the 24th of Muharram,
Tuesday, 23rd June 1310. That is according to Amir Khusrau, the
topography and the chronology of the invasion. ;

The first question that would naturally arise from out of it is what
is actually the route taken by the invasion. There is a lead that Amir
Khusrau gives us to determine this point. An invading army starting
from Delhi towards the south can choose a number of routes; but,
having regard to the fact that the objective here was Telingana, the
road taken would naturally be the shortest possible route for this
particular objective. An invasion of Telingana, which Amir Khusrau
does not mention, by way of Bengal had turned out to be a failure.
So the extreme eastern route is to be taken to have been altogether
avoided. The readiest route would be the road going through Bharat-

rn achieniatdntminseten: maeenl
pur, Biana, Kota southwards straight to Nagda, the present day

“railway Station, from which there are straight r¢ roads to ‘Ujjain and | to
arene rnin imrnnaae ns erarcborare eer a ne ae 7

~Diar, and across the Narmada to the south.
But this route is barred by the consideration that in that part of

the journey before Narmada they had to do nine days of marching

to reach Mas‘iidptir, wherever it was, and it took another six days
of very arduous marching crossing five rivers by the fords till at
least Irijpur or Sultanpur could be reached. Withont knowing
where Mas‘tidpir lay and what Irijpur or Sultanpur is we could hardly
settle this route of march. Mas‘tdptir was reached actually nine days
after leaving Delhi. That must mean about a hundred to hundred and
fifty miles from Delhi. We shall have to locate the place Mas‘tadptr
somewhere about the region of Bharatpur. It is after reaching
Mas'tidpir that the five rivers had to be crossed. So taking that alone
into consideration we would not perhaps be wrong in locating the
town somewhere near about Bharatpur. The first river crossed is the
tiver Jun. That seems to be the river that passes through Biana to
fall into the Jumna, one of its streams being called Banganga, and the
other river Gambhir flowing into it, and passing through Biana, not
very far from the south of Bharatpur on the road. The next river
crossed is given as the river Chambal. Chambal could be crossed over
a very great length, and that may not give us anything like a definite
Jead as to the actual road. The next river is the river Kunwari. This
river luckily happens to be a tributary of the river Chambal, and is of


--- Page 30 ---
=xiv

comparatively much shorter length, and therefore its crossing, limits
the length through which we shall have to look for the road. Therefore
the army could not have taken even the high road leading from Muttra
through Bharatpur, Gangapur and Kota to Jhalrapatam and Sitamau.
We have to look for the route of this invasion farther to the east of
this road. It seems to take us towards Gwalior. Therefore the
. invading army might have marched through Bharatpur, or xt might have
avoided it and taken the Agra route, proceeding to Dholpur and
Gwalior. In the course of this march and before: reaching Gwalior, the
“army would have crossed the three rivers Jun, Chambal and Kunwari,
Itis on the road between Gwalior and Sultanpur-Irijpur, that the
other two rivers must have been crossed, the two rivers Binas, as it is
given there by Amir Khusrau, and Bhoji. Sir Henry Elliot gives
different readings and takes what is written Kunw4ri by Amir Khusrau
to be the equivalent of Kuari, which seems quite correct. What he
wrote as Beas seems to be, according to the reading of Prof. Habib,
Binas. It makes no difference; probably it is the river Sindhu, which
must have been crossed, the eastern Sindhu, not the Kali-Sindhn in
Rajputana. Elliot therefore is probably right in his identification.
But the next river is given as Bhoji, according to the reading of
Professor Habib. It was read Bashuji by Elliot, though he gives the
alternative Bhoji. Bhoji seems really the correct reading ; but what
is the river called Bhoji? Elliot of course makes the suggestion that
it must be the Bethwa; but was it called Bhojithat Amir Khusrau
could be so specific about its name? It is very likely that, at the time
that Amir Khusrau was writing, it had the name Bhoji, because it was
by damming the upper course of this river that the great Bhojpur Lake
near Bhopal had been formed; and, while the large lake was still in
existence, it is very probable that the stream that brought the super-
fluous waters of the lake was called Bhoji at least by the people. So
it leaves but little room to doubt that the Bhoji river here is the
Bethwa and nothing else. Having crossed these, Sultanpur or Trijpur

was reached by the army. The road taken therefore seems to be the

tailway “road of to-day along which to “a considerable. p part of it one
“sees "a road also. following. It would mean Gwalior, crossing the
. Sindhu, “Jhansi, and from Jhansi crossing the Bethwa to Lalitpur,
i i Btawa, Bhilsa and Bhopal, That is how the railroad passes. Probably

there was a road going down that way at least with the possibility of


--- Page 31 ---
XRV

a military road atthat time. Six days’ march from not far south of
Bharatpur through very difficult roads could not have amounted to
more than a hundred miles at the outside, and that would bring us to
somewhere near Bhilsa. Bhilsa or Bhopal would mean very near
three degrees of latitude. It is somewhere about that region, it
may be a little more to the north than Bhilsa itself, that we shall
have to locate Sultanpur or Irijpur at. One is able to see nothing
corresponding to it on the maps, unless we take it to be Sagar; but
that is going too far east for the purposes of a match towards
Warangal. Bhopal would be going a little far too south, and would
perhaps put it beyond the actual point reached. Barni mentions
Chanderi as the place where the muster of the army was held, and
where the auxiliaries from Hindustan came and joined the main army.
It is just possible that the halt of four days at Sultanpur was due to
this cause, and Chanderi or region near about was either Irijpur or
Sultanpur. But then Chanderi could be reached without crossing the
Bethwa; but a route could be taken which necessitated the crossing
of the Bethwa to reach Chanderi. Somewhere about that region
therefore would be Sultanpur-Irijpur. ‘There is a place marked Babina
about 12 to 15 miles of Gwalior wherefrom you can take a small road
to Chanderi without crossing the Bethwa. If on the contrary the hich
road to Lalitpur be taken, one has to cross the Bethwa before long.
At Talbahat on this road, a smaller road branches off to Chanderi
crossing the Bethwa again. This probably was the road taken.

There is a four days’ halt provided at Sultanpurin Amir Khnsrau’s
account, which might well have been utilised for the purpose indi-
cated in the narrative of Barni. Another thirteen days’ march brought
them to Khanda, in all probability the railway junction Kandwa across
the Narmada, which itreached on December 5, 1309. The route taken
from Chanderi probably was the familiar route of those days towards
Sarangpur, thence to Ujjain, thence to Dhar and across farther, while
it was open for the army to have taken the route from Sarangpur,
perhaps to Indore, and thence across by way of Mandhata to Kandwa.
There they made a great halt, and spent the time of the fast of Mary
(Mariam) leaving the place the day after the fast. It took eight days’
march after crossing the Narmada at Mandhata to reach a place called
Nilkanth on the frontier of Deogiri. This place must be somewhere
near the river Tapti, the road taking the army through Asirgarh and

D


--- Page 32 ---
xKVI

Burhanpur towards the railway junction of Jalgaom, not very far
‘from Nandurbar, the frontier station of the kingdom of Ram Deo,
over which Rai Karan at one time was appointed to rule. Nilkanth
was reached on the last day of December 1309. Then there is a long
journey of 16 days to bring the army to the next station on the march,
which is put down as Bas'iragarh in the doab of two rivers Yashnar
and Baruji, or Yashar and Bhuji as in the manuscript used by Profes-
sor Habib. The question now is what was the actual route adopted,
and in what direction did the army move, for neither of which is there
an indication. We are able to locate Nilkanth itself only by guess,
and Nilkanth may be somewhere near Burhanpur—not very far in that
region. That means the army had been taken over the Vindbya
mountains, the Narmada and the Satpura. If Deogiri had been the
objective, the route would have Jain through Baglana over the Tapti
and the hills on the southern side of it. But the main thoroughfares
avoid the hilly region, and lead through Burhanpur, Elichpur,
Amaraoti, Nagpur and further eastwards, two or three roads crossing
the frontier of the present-day Nizam’s Dominions and concentrating
on Warangal. It would be a matter of some importance to know
where Bas'iragarh was notwithstanding Amir Khusrau’s taking the
trouble to define it as in the doab of two rivers Yashar and Bhuji.
There is the additional detail given in Amir Khusrau’s description
that it was a place where diamonds were found in plenty. The road
is described as a difficult road, but that is said to be the road to Tilang,
and Bas‘irégarh is said to have contained a diamond mine. Making
use of these details, we ought to follow one of the roads, taken per-
haps even by the British armies in the Mahratta wars through Elich-
pur, Amaraoti and Nagpur; therefrom defiecting south-eastwards
towards the frontier of the Nizam’s Dominions one road goes across
the Wainganga, and reaches a place which is now-a-days called Waira-
garh placed on the bend of a small river which flows. into the Wain-
ganga with another stream north of it emptying itself very near.
The very name Wairagarh would answer to the description that
diamonds were found there. There are two rivers, in fact there are
three rivers round about it. The name Bastiragarh is read by Elliot
as Bijanagar. There are places with that name, or comething very
near on the borders of Berar, but they will not answer the other details
of Amir Khusrau’s description. The recommendation for identifying


--- Page 33 ---
al
xvi

it with Wairagarh is the actual fact that there is a roadway leading
from that straight down into the Nizam’s Dominions by way of Karim-
nagar towards Warangal. But if Warangal had been the objective,
there is a shorter road through Chanda, across the Painganga entering
into the Nizam’s Dominions almost about the same region as this other
road. Going to Wairagarh would make a slight deviation which may
not be impossible, having regard to the possible road conditions six
centuries ago. It must be remembered that Malik Ka€fitir left the
main body of his troops in Bas'iragarh, and made a dash, as is usual
with him, in these southern campaigns that he undertook, upon a
place which Amir Khusrau calls Sarbar. This Sarbar is as near as
possible in sound to Sirpur just across the river Painganga which is
reachable by roadways now from Chanda across the river, and from
where Bas‘iragarh is actually situated. The road on the way to
Chanda seems to be a bigger road now-a-days; but that does not
" necessarily mean that it was so in the thirteenth century. Sirpur is
set almost on the borders of the Nizam’s Dominions where the Nirmal
range of the Sahyadri almost vanishes into plain ground, making the
road easy even for an army with heavy equipment. It is straight
on a line with Mantani and Warangal; that Mantani on the Goda-
vari was one of those places on the highway northwards from
Warangal is referred to as having been visited by Malik Kaftir’s con-
temporary Pratapa Rudra of Warangal on one of the occasions that
he had to go north towards Delhi. Sirpur it seems probable was the
frontier post against which Malik Kaftir made a cavalry dash. Hav-
ing mastered possession of this he had the means to learn about the
further route to Warangal, and something about the defences of the
fort and the resources of its ruler. Probably the main army joined
-him leisurely at Sarbar, which he left on Saturday, January 7, 1310,
and reached Kunarbai in the outskirts of Warangal in the course of
a week. In the account of Firishta, the army is said to have reached
the pargana of Indur on the frontier of Tilang. The pargana of
Indur would be the pargana of Nizamabad of to-day, which place
was what was known as Indur. It undoubtedly is on the road from
Deogiri to Warangal. Firishta is apparently under a misimpression
here, as he takes Malik Kafiir’s army to Deogiri itself, whereas both
Amir Khusrau and Barni mention that the army reached only the
Deogiri frontier which Amir Khusrau precisely locates at Nilkanth,


--- Page 34 ---
sxviil

and Barni also states it clearly that it was only the frontier and not
the capital of Deogiri that was actually reached. Firishta must
therefore be wrong as, if our identification of Sarbar with Sirpur
should happen to be correct, the march from Sirpur to the region
of Nizamabad would make rather an extensive detour, which it
is not likely was made in the actual circumstances of the case, though
the possibility is not altogether excluded. The station reached is said
to be Kunarbal. Probably it was one of those villages in the near
outskirts of Warangal. There is nothing to answer the name Kunar-
bal, onthe maps. Buta place Kunar, not far from Warangal, but a
little to the south of it by south-west, on the road from Nizamabad is
marked on the India Atlas. Even granting that the army marched
straight down from Sirpur to Jaktiyal, and therefrom passed on to
Warangal through Karimnagar, itis not impossible that a cainp was
erected a little to the south of the town for other military advantages.
Therefrom the operations were continued Jeading to the fall of War-
angal, and the treaty that brought the campaign to a close. The
army set forward on its march, on Thursday, March 19, 1310, and
reached Delhi on Wednesday, June 10, 1310, taking in all two months
and twenty-five days for the return journey. Amir Khusrau gives no
indication of the route taken for the return journey, but Barni notes
that the return journey was by the route of Deogiri, Dhar, Jhaiun,
which is a clear indication that this is not the route originally taken on
the outward journey, though it indicates unmistakably again that this
was probably the more usual route. The route of march downwards
to Warangal must have been Chanderi, Sarangpur, Indore, Khandwa,
etc. The march onwards might have been the more western route
crossing the Narmada at Maheswar, Kalghat-Dharampur, as it is called,
marching up north to Mandu, from there to Nagda northwards
through Kota to Bharatpur, Muttra, Delhi. In this journey it is very
probable that the army marched from: Warangal on to Deogiri, and
passed through Ram Deo’s capital, although it is not stated so in so
many words.

The army spent the season of the rains in Delhi and started for the
south on the campaign against Ma’bar on November 20, 1310. A
muster of the army was taken at Tankal, otherwise written Natgal, on
the Jumna, and marching orders were given on the 2nd December
following. In one straight march the army came to a place called


--- Page 35 ---
xxix

Katihun in 21 days, and a further 17 days took them to Gurgaom,
crossing three rivers of which the biggest was the Narmada. This
summary description gives the impregsion that the route taken was
the usual route in which the army met with no incidents of an untoward
character. In all probability that route was the route of the return
march from Warangal we described above. The army would have come
down as far as Muttra, and turned south-westwards along the great
highroad through Bharatpur, Savai-Madhopur, Kota, Jhalrapetan as far
as Nagda. There is no place that is identifiable with anything like
Katihun that Amir Khusrau speaks of; at any rate, there is nothing
satisfactory so far. But having regard to the lengthof march and the
summary description, we may possibly take it that the stage Katihun
was somewhere near the regionof Nagda. Gurgaom must be located
somewhere between Burhanpur and the Tapti, a distance of about
five marches from where Deogiri actually is. The road taken this
time probably went from the Narmada at Maheswar southwards
to Pansemal, from which Nandurbar, Sindkheda and Dhulian and
Jalgaom can all be reached across the Tapti; and beyond them
lay Chalesgaom, and across the Sahyadri, Deogiri. There is nothing
like Gurgaom on the maps in this locality, and we must therefore
remain content with not being able to find its modern equivalent.
Leaving Gurgaom, the army reached the Tapti, and crossing it reached
Deogiri in five marches after leaving Gurgaom, on the 17th Ramzan,
equivalent to 8th February 1311. There the army made a halt, and
according to Barni, Ram Deo having died and Sankar Dev being the
ruler, the malik appointed some one to attend to the needs of the
army marching on the further journey. From there five marches took
them across the three rivers, Sini, Godavari and Binhur to the place
which Amir Khusrau calls the Kharababad of a Paras Deo Dalvi.
Working on the account of Elliot alone, I took Kharababad as an actual
name ofa place. But with the translation before me now it strikes
me it is merely Amir Khusrau’s description where he plays upon an
attribute that he himself had given to Deogiri by calling it Almanabad,
a city of safety, and by way of contrast, he calls the other Kharababad,
which he gives again to Kandur inthe south. That must have been
the headquarters of the southern government under the general Parsu
Deo, the Dalavai, Parsu being the contracted form of Parasuram. The
road starting from Deogiri and going southwards has to cross three


--- Page 36 ---
rivers whichever way it went. But the usual way in those days seems
to have been from Deogiri through the interior towards Bhir, almost
straight east of Ahmadnagar, and, across the Balaghat range, to some-
where near Ashti or Kharda, two frontier stations where during the
Mahratta wars battles were fought. Marching from there to Barsi and
along south by way of Naldurg to Sholapur and thence to Pandarpur.
If, as is possible, Sholapur had been the headquarters of Parasuram
Deo, the condition that the Bhima was one of the three rivers crossed
is not satisfied. But if instead the road taken was from Barsi to
Pandarpur, one of the familiar roads, both the Sina and the Bhima
would be crossed. Pandarpur was probably the frontier station, and
that was the government of Parsudevo Dalvi. We have reference to
an inscription of the Hoysala Vira S6méSvara discovered there. It is
therefore clear that Pandarpur was the frontier between the two
kingdoms of Ballala and Yadava. Therefrom, after holding a council
of war, Malik Kafir started at the head of one fiman (a division of
ten thousand soldiers), and made a dash upon Dvarasamudra, reaching
the place after twelve marches, on the 25th February 1311. Without
much of fighting, terms of peace were arranged with Vira BallaJa, not
Viranarasinga as stated by Elliot and copied from him by Professor
Habib. After the terns of the treaty had been arranged, Malik Kafar
probably remained there some time when the main army joined him.
After a stay of about twelve days, he left Dvarasamudra on 10th
March 1311. Five marches took them to the frontier of Ma’bar. From
there two passes had to be crossed, which, according to Professor
Habib’s reading, are Tarmali and Tabar. The first according to
Elliot's reading Sarmalai, introduced a certain amount of confusion,
Marching through these passes, they came to the bank of a river,
which Elliot noted as Kanobari which name Professor Habib says, does
not occur in the manuscript. But as a river is mentioned, and, in the
next stage of the narrative, itis what is called Kanauri, the river under
reference is apparently the Kaveri. There they encamped for the
night, and left on the 25th March 1311 towards Birdhul. Unfortunately
for us, Amir Khusrau uses the name Birdhul once for the capital,
another time for the ruler, and contributes to make confusion worse
confounded, We have to take Birdhul to be the equivalent of Vira-
Chola. That would be all right if it is applied to the capital. But the
ruler against whom he went was Vira Pandya, and, in that case, we


--- Page 37 ---
xxei

shall have to take it that the ruler was Bir or Vira, ruler of the Chola
country for the time being. Amir Khusrau’s tendency to play
upon the word Bir only adds to the confusion. Here the incidents
of the war are said to be an attack of Birdhul, Vira Pandya fleeing
from there to a place called Kandur on the outskirts of the
forests.

Notwithstanding all the destruction that was committed in Kandur,
which Amir Khusrau calls here Kharababad, which seems to be a
term of opprobrium with him and nothing more, the Muhammadan
army suspected that Vira Pandya fled to the sea-shore for protection
to a fortress of his there, which, according to the reading of Elliot,
was given as Jalkota; but Professor Habib’s reading of the
manuscript makes it Jat Kuta. Certain people coming from that
direction gave the information that Vira Pandya had not gone in that
direction; as no information of either the king or of his army was to

‘be had, and as Amir Khusrau indulges in a pun that Vira Pandya
washed his hands off the sea and. fled rather to the forests, as offering
more satisfactory protection to his army, it is probable Vira Pandya
fled towards the Pachamalais on the Salem frontier. The army
therefore returned to Kandur, and went forward in search of Vira
Pandya through the dense forests surrounding the town. Finding
progress impossible they were content to remain at Kandur receiving
the submission of the Musalman part of the army left behind. The
account of Amir Khusrau makes it appear, and it may be true as other
accounts seem to confirm fit more or less, that Malik Kafiir was
particular about capturing the elephants of the enemy; but so far he
was disappointed in not getting possession of as many elephants as he
wished to secure, or perhaps as he expected. Just at this juncture
information reached him that in a place called Barmatpur—Elliot’s
reading Brahmastpur—there was a golden temple and a rich city with
temples and idols to be plundered together with some elephants,
which they were-given to understand were kept there for greater
security. The army marched to Barmatpur or Brahmastpur, which, of
course, is stated in so many words to be destroyed completely, the
images of Siva and Vishnu alike being included in the destruction.
The whole place seems to have been dug up for buried treasure, and
after taking whatever was possible to get, the army was preparing to
proceed to the next stage of their work.

On the 11th Zil Qa’d, which seems to correspond to April 1,
1311, they left the Chola country on their march towards Madura.
The first stage in the march after four days was a place which
the narrative calls Kim here, but which was read Kham by Elliot.
Five marches thence they reached Madura, Matra, the ‘ dwelling
place of the brother of the Rai Sundara Pandya.’ The king
‘with his household and all that could be carried, had fled, and the
invading army found nothing’ there excepting an empty palace with
only three elephants in the temple of Jagannath (Sokkanatha).
Malik Kafair’s disappointment was very great. He took possession of
the three elephants and sent them all to join the rest of the elephants
taken in the course of this invasion; and Amir Khusrau accounts 512
of such elephants taken so far in this invasion. The anger of the
invading general showed itself in destroying by fire both the temple
and the palace in the immediate neighbourhood. So far as this
account is concerned, the campaign comes to a close here. On
Sunday the 4th Zil Hijja, which would correspond to the 24th or the
25th of April 131], the army set forward on the return journey and
reached Delhi and presented itself in the durbar of the Sultan on
Monday the 29th September 1311, having been five months and two or
three days on the return journey. The rest of the account is occupied
of course, with the description of the wealth that was carried from
the invasion, and what Allauddin himself did with the spoils of the
war.

Now proceeding to an examination of the route of this invasion,
we have already indicated that the road taken this time should have
been the high road from Delhi to almost Nagda, from there to Indore,
from there to Dhar, across the Narmada to Deogiri; from Deogiri,
the army proceeded to Bhir, and thence across on the road to Parenda,
from thence southwards to Barsi and across to Pandarpur, the fief of
‘Persdevo’. From there Malik Kafiir made a dash at the head of a
select and compact body of troops, about ten thousand strong, against
Dvarasamudra, Halabid of the Hoysalas, under Vira Ballala. No
battle is described, and no battles were obviously fought. But the
Ballala submitted and terms of treaty were arranged, sending forward
the treaty with the Ballaéla prince to the headquarters for ratification
of the treaty. We must note here that no further campaign is
mentioned by Amir Khusrau, nor is any made of any battle fought, or


--- Page 39 ---
XXRUI

siege laid in Dvarasamudra. Therefrom five marches took the army
to the frontier, by way of the Hoysala country, to that of the Chola-
Pandya. The dash from Pandarpur upon Dvarasamudra could have
been only by one of two well-known routes, either from Pandarpur to
Bijapur, and by the eastern road through Anegundi and Hampi
straight along as far as Hiriyur in Mysore, and thence to Banawar and
Halabid. Returning by the same route as far as Banavar and taking
the route to strike the main road at Chikknayakanhalli, the army must
have marched forward towards the passes into the Salem District
at Hosur; or they must have marched taking the western route
through Dvarasamudra and Halabid to Harihar, thence coming down
as far as Kadur or even Banavar, and leaving for Dvarasamudra.
The main army joined Malik Kafar at Dvarasamudra. From there
the road taken was surely the eastern road through Gubbi and
Bangalore towards Hosur, Krishnagiri and across the hills in the
Salem District. In those days that was a very well-known route, and
one of the highways of communication between the country above the
ghauts and below. Amir Khusrau gives us no very particular infor-
mation possibly because there was nothing -interesting that occurred.
The whole route lay through the country of Vira Ballala, and, once a
treaty had been entered into, nothing could well have happened
worth mentioning. But from Hosur south, it is a new route and it
tuns through hostile country. Amir Khusrau mentions two passes;
according to Elliot’s reading, the names are Sarmali and Tabar;
but Professor Habib’s reading is Tarmali and Tabar. The objective
of the invasion seems to have been to strike the Kaveri some-
where. That gives us a little lead where there was actually
none. After mentioning the passes the name of the river is
given as Kanobari, according to the manuscript of Elliot. But in
the manuscript used by Professor Habib, the term Kanobari
does not occur; but later on in speaking of their striking camp,
the starting point is given as Kanauri, which amounts to as much
as mentioning the river before. In both the cases, the river where
they came for the night must have been the river Kaveri either
on the banks of which, or in the sands of which, they spent the night,
The ghat road through Salem leaving Hosur has to pass through
Hosur, Krishnagiri, ther Dharmapuri on to Salem, Trichengode,

Bhavani, across the Kaveri as one route. That is the route taken
E


--- Page 40 ---
xxxiv

now-a-days. There is another, Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri, Taramangalam
reaching the banks of the Kaveri higher up than Bhavani perhaps
almost opposite the place where now the Mettur dam is being
built. Of course, an army marching would certainly see to the facility
of crossing the river Kaveri at a place where it can easily be forded.
There are two passes here ; and whichever of the routes be taken, the
army bas to pass through Toppur. Toppur is a village where there
is a little stream, which is called Toppur river; and as it cuts its way
through one of the spurs of the Eastern Ghats, the pass gets the
name Toppur pass. It is a well-known place on the road from the
plain country into Mysore in days before the railway. There is no
need to get through another pass at all if the route through Omalur-
Salem be taken; but the mention of a second pass and the.
definite statement in the account of Amir Khusrau that there were
two passes to cross, give clear indication that the road taken was the
other, and probably it is the old ford on the Kaveri at which the
river could be crossed with ease to the opposite bank, where in those
days there were important towns along which the road ran to the
south. Tarmali is probably the Taramangalam river, or the passa
little to the west of Taramangalam. Then after crossing the Kaveri
the army left on its march. If they had crossed the Kaveri before
marching, which seems to be indicated in the statement of Amir
Khusrau, the road would take them down south as far as Musiri close
to the Kaveri, and then the road takes off from the Kaveri into the
interior, At Musiri there is even now a well-known ford across the
Kaveri. Probably that was a ford even in the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries. Crossing the Kaveri again, although it is not
mentioned, the road could be taken on the other side of the Kaveri
and the Coleroon to the Chola capital at JayamkondachoJapuram or
Gangaikondachdlapuram, the former of which appears to have been
the Pandya capital of the Chola country at the time. The route
between Musiri and Trichinopoly on the other side of the river would
be comparatively inconvenient for an army. There were so many
water channels and the country is so thoroughly agricultural that the
difficulty would be really great, unless the army had made a detour
into the interior and marched towards the south to Madura by way of
Dindigul. The objective being Birdhul, according to Amir Khusrau,
we.shall have to fix upon what that is. Undoubtedly that must have


--- Page 41 ---
X3XV

been the capital of the Chola country, now the eastern capital of the
Pandya empire. The capital in those days must have been Jayam-
kondacholapuram, which is about six miles to the west of Gangaikonda-
chélapuram on the highroad to Kumbhakonam on the one side, and
Trichinopoly on the other on the northern bank of the Coleroon. That
was the capital of the great Pandya Maravarman Kulasékhara, and
records of his reign state that he issued his orders from a garden palace
outside the city of JayamkondachGlapuram. But even this does not
bring us any nearer to Birdhul. Since the phonetic approach that we
could make to Birdhul is Vira-Chola, and, as we hear often of hails and
palaces bearing names of these princes in some of these cities, such
as for instance Mudikondagolan in Gangaikondachdlapuram, it is just
possible that this city Jayamkondachdlapuram contained halis which
may have been called Viragolan. ViraSolan was a common name of a
large number of princes, and there were two emperors who bore the
name, Virarajendra ruling from A.p. 1063 to A.D. 1070, and Kulot-
tunga III not long before the date of the invasion, who had the title
Tirubhuvana Vira. Other indications point closely to that as the centre
of the attack, Jtis not very far from Chidambaram, where often,
these princes anointed themselves in the hall of the holy place there,
soon after the royal ceremony in the capita]. If then Jayamkonda-
chdlapuram is what is to be taken to be the Birdhul, what is Kandur
and the forests near about? Kandur is undoubtedly Kannaniir on the
northern bank of the Coleroon about six miles from Srirangam across
the comparatively big river. Kannantr must have been a place of
importance at the time, as that happened to be the Hoysala capital
down to the time of Vira Ballala. It was only some years after
Vira Ballala began to rule that the whole of the Hoysala territory
above the Ghats and helow united into one with Vira Ballala
as ruler. Till then his uncle, and after him that uncle’s son ruled
over the country south with their principal capital at Kannanir
with an alternative which finds mention as Kundani, which is now
satisfactorily located in the Baramahals of the Salem District, not
very far from Hosur. This Kannanitir might have been on the way of
march towards ViraSolan, but if the invasion went in the first instance
to the capital of the country, they might have passed Kannaniir
by. Kannantir would otherwise answer to the description given
in Amir Khusrau. It is on the outskirts of the forest almost on


--- Page 42 ---
XXXvi

three sides except on the side towards Srirangam. It probably was
the centre of a Muhammadan population even before the days of Malik
Kafar, as there were a number of places in which Muhammadans were
settled for purposes of commerce, at any rate, in the interior, as
there were very old settlements of these in a number of places along
the coast. Vira Pandya when he was attacked in Birdhul retired
after a faint resistance to Kandur, where the Islamic army chased
him. But when they went to Kandur, Kharababad as it is called,
they did not find Vira Pandya or his army there. They inferred
naturally that he must have gone away in the other direction
to another fortress of strength, where he could find efficient
protection. According to Amir Khusrau’s account, it must be a place
towards the sea, the sea itself contributing to its defence. According
to Elliot’s manuscript, it is Jalkota, but Professor Habib reads
it Jat Kuta, There is not much substantial difference in the
latter part of the word. Kota and Kita could be easily mistaken
in pronunciation. But whether it is Jat or Jal would make a
substantial difference in sense. With the reading Jat, it is rather hard
to make anything out of it. Jal, water, may make some sense, and |
the way that Amir Khusrau seems to play upon the term sea and the
statement that Bir, Vira Pandya washed his hands off the sea, would
seem to indicate that perhaps the correcter reading would be Jal. In
such a case, the place would be Jalkdta or water fortress, as Amir
Khusrau is actually describing Vira Pandya as having run away for the
protection of the sea. This must have been the strong fortress, which,
in the centuries following, played an important part, and which in the
days of the British used to be called Devacotta, really Tivukota, the fort-
ress on the island, popularly spoken of as Tikotai, which is at the mouth
of the Coleroon, but in those days extending perhaps northwards to a
considerable distance into the island which the river has formed there.
There used to be a flourishing seaport at the mouth of the Coleroon,
which in the days of the Cholas used to be called Jayarhkonda Chila-
pattinam, or briefly Jayangondapattinam. But the Mubammadan army
did not march there having had information that Vira Pandya had not
gone in that direction. Their attempt to follow him into the forest
proved infeasible, and they had no alternative but to content themselves
with what they had been able to do, Perhaps the inevitable elephants
had not been secured in number, Timely information came to Malik


--- Page 43 ---
xXxxvii

Kaftr that the elephants of Bir were kept in a strong place which
Professor Habib reads as Bharmatpur, and which Elliot read as
Brahmastpur. Hither of the readings would be equivalent of the
Hindu Brahmapuri, which I have indicated from the circumstantial
account of Amir Khusrau himself to stand for Brahmapuri-Chidam-
baram, which according to the account of Amir Khusrau, Malik Kaftr
sacked. He destroyed the temples and the idols there, and even dug
up the place for buried wealth, having secured some elephants also.
He broke camp from this locality and started on the invasion of
Madura, Matra, as Amir Khusrau calls it, and Mardi as Wassaf
Writes it, more truly catching up the popular name of the town. The
first stage in the march which seems to have taken them about
four days was mentioned as Kham by Elliot, and Kim by Professor
Habib. Bither way it does not take us nearer to a satisfactory
identification, which may be regarded as certain. We have to remain
content with what I stated in my South India and Her Muhammadan
Invaders on pages 104-5, that probably it stands for Kadambavanam,
which would be about sixty miles from Chidambaram. It may have
taken five marches to reach it. Another five marches from there, they
reached the town of Madura, the habitual capital of the Pandyas, even
under Vira Pandya. The capital had been evacuated by the ruler who
carried away his treasure and household to a place which is mentioned
as Mankul, which Elliot attempted to identify with Namakkal.
Namakkal is too far out for the purpose. It is there probably the two
Mangalams, Méla (Upper) and Kila (Lower) on the Western Ghats,
which may be regarded as places of security. Not finding anything
but three elephants, the Muhammadans set fire to the temple itself and
taking the three elephants returned making up a total of 512 elephants
for this invasion. This is as far as Amir Khusraun’s account according
to the Khaza’inul Futtth or Tarik-i Alai takes us.

Before we close this introduction we ought to refer to two minor
points which are neither of them mentioned in this account. Firishta
is responsible for the statement, given in the portion translated by
Professor Habib himself, that Malik Kafiir, in the course of his
southern invasions, constructed a masjid. It is called Masjid-i-Alai,
Allaiuddin’s Mosque, at ‘Sit Band Ramisar’, and adds that the mosque
was to be seen existing in his days early in the seventeenth century.
The designation Sita Band Ramisar would lead one readily to take it


--- Page 44 ---
XXXVili

that it is Séetubanda Raméévara, or RaméSwaram, where a big dam
across the sea ascribed to Rama exists. But Firishta’s own descrip-
tion gives the lie direct. He says that the Malik Naib after over-
coming Bikal Dev, the Raja of the Carnatic, plundered the country,
and itis in that invasion and in that connection that he says that he
built a mosque in that country of Carnatik, and later, in the same
connection, that the mosque could be seen in that country and describes
it as ‘the port of Dur Samandar on the shore of the sea of Ummam’.
Sea of Ummam is certainly the Arabian Sea, and the port or Dur
Samandar must be a port in the country of Dvarasamudra, that is the
HoySala country. It cannot therefore refer to Rameéswaram by any
stretch of language. There is no reference to such a thing in the
account of Amir Khusrau, or in the abridged account of Zia Barni. It
is just possible that a raid was undertaken towards the west coast.
But this has nothing whatever to do with RaméSwaram in the distant
south. That would lead us to the question whether Raméswaram, or
that region, was ever at all invaded by Malik Kafiir. We have seen
that Malik Kafir, in the course of these wars, was in the habit of
making dashing raids against various places. From the capital of
Hoysala a raid to the west coast may seem possible. It is from
Pandarpur that he first undertook a raid towards Dvarasamudra. It
will be noticed that from the camp of Bas'tragarh, a raid was undertaken
against Sarbar on the occasion of the invasion of Warangal. It is not
at all unlikely that he sent out a raid, or led it himself from his camp
at Madura towards Raméswaram as a likely place where the elephants
that he wanted so much and the wealth of the Pandya might lie hidden.
In another work of Amir Khusrau called Ashika, he speaks. of an
invasion up to the shores of the sea of Lanka, against the ruler whom
he called Pandya Guru. He mentioned his capital by the name Fatan
where there was an idol temple. This, in all probability, is no other
than RaméSsvarapattinam, as we may call it now, as well as Peria-
pattinam and another Pattinam on the opposite coast of India.
Excepting for this raid we have no information whatever that M4lik
Kafur had anything more to do with RaméSwaram. It may therefore
be taken to be that he carried his raids as far as Raméfwaram. It is
hardly possible that he built a mosque there though there might have
been one already, and that Firishta’s account is the result of a confusion
that the mosque was built at Sétu-RaméSwaram when he speaks of the


--- Page 45 ---
NXXIX

sea of Omman. For a further discussion of this, reference may be
made to South India and Her Muhammadan Invaders.

We must close the introduction with pointing out the services that
Professor Habib has rendered to students of Indian History by giving
such a good translation of this difficult work of Amir Khusrau, and:
adding to the translation itself material from other works bearing on
the subject, which would enable a student to arrive at a satisfactory
conclusion regarding the invasions of the south under Allauddin.
This work needed the doing and we are grateful indeed to Professor
Habib for having taken up this work and done it so well.

CHAPTER I

PREFACE

This book, which contains an account of victories, has been given the
title of ‘Khazstinul Futtth’ from Heaven. 1 All praises are for the
Opener, who opened the gates of victories for the religion of
Mohammad and raised his helpers high with Divine assistance:
Exalted is His Dignity and Supreme His Kingdom! And blessings
on the Prophet of the Sword, who with a sign cut open the moon and
the breast, and showed with conclusive proofs: ‘And All&h did
certainly assist you at Badr’? And peace to his Family and his pious
Companions, who woke up the sleepers with the tongue and the sword.
May love for them never cease to cling to our hearts cven as victory clings to
the sword of the pious Sultan of the world! After praises of God in all
sincerity, and of the Prophet in particular, the treasury of praises is
not deserved by any one except the august Emperor. /é will be right
ti I said in his praise, that he ts the exalted sun which illuminates the
moon. And he is the Sultan of the monarchs of the earth, more
brilliant than the sun and moon when they rise! The ‘shadow of
God’? over the heads of men! The protector of all creatures from the
vicissitudes of time! The crystal sphere of excellence! The exalted
sun! ‘“4lauddunya waddin’ The equal of the sun and moon onhigh!
The light of both the worlds in darkness, etc., etc. Adorned with
every exalted virtue, Mohammad Shah, the Sultan! Afay God cast his
shadow over ali things so long as the clouds drop dew over the carth trom
on high £8

1The panegyrist of the ‘Alai Empire, the servant Khusrau, states
_ that however high his pen may raise its feet and crawl through all the
regions of black and white, it is unable to pass the first stage of the
Emperor’s praise. But as it was written in the Book of Creation that
the pen, which eulogises the Emperor, should come within my fingers
‘ like the shooting-star within the crescent or the sun in its constellation,’
Divine kindness, the key to unlimited blessings,—‘ and for Allah are
the treasures of Heaven and Earth ’—opened to me the gates of His
treasures. Gems such as had never been bestowed on Bakhtari and
Abt Tamam were showered on my pages; though every one of them
was suchas Venus could not afford to purchase, yet none was worthy
of being used in praise of the celestial monarch. Nevertheless, since
more precious gems were not to be found in the human mind, as a matter
of necessity I stringed these in order, expecting that the Emperor will
be an ocean of mercy, which throws out nothing that falls into it.

27 believed that my crooked words, like the offerings of an ant
before Solomon’s throne 3 (May it rule for ever over men and fxs /)
will be accepted, for every poem I present to the Emperor, though
it be nothing else but a dried up river, is yet filled with water through
the stream of his kindness, and, aided by the favourable current, the
boats of my mind can float through all the regions of land and sea.
Having been drowned in his favours in the past, I am emboldened to
proceed further; and having often dived in oceans of poetry and
brought out heaps of pearls, I also wished to adorn some pages of
prose for the high festival. And even like the effect of the sun on
precious stones, the Emperor's look will turn them into things of value.
As my pen, like a tirewoman, has generally curled the hair of her -
maidens in verse and has seldom shown them in pages of prose, she
raises her grateful face to the Emperor: ‘May the august eyes
disregard my defect.’*

tIf the stream of my life was given the good news of eternal
existence, even then I would not offer the thirsty any drink except
the praises of the Second Alexander.2 But asl find that human life
is such that in the end we have to wash our hands off it, the fountain
of my words will only enable the reader to moisten his lips. Since
the achievement of my life-time, from the cradle to the grave, cannot
be more than this, I did not consider it proper to plunge to the bottom
of endless oceans but contented myself with a small quantity of the
water of life. 3 The mirror of the Second Alexander# is such that, if
totally illuminated, its images cannot be contained by the looking-
glass of the sky. How, then, can they appear in the rust-eaten mind
of his servant? Still some things, which I have, I will show according
to the capacity of my imagination and in such a way as I can,—so
that if critics have any doubts about my talents, such doubts may be
removed. I hope that when this spotless mifror, in which his virtuous
existence has been portrayed, comes before the eyes of the Second
Alexander, he will compare it with the original; if it is well con-
structed and its images are correct, he will place it among his select
courtiers ; but, if from inartistic or crooked execution, there is anything
in it contrary to the picture of fire, he will signify so, in order that I
may correct it so far as possible. I hope, however, that he will not
turn away his face from it, for then my images will vanish as if
they had never been. xt J know that a mtrror constructed in the reign
of Alexander can never be crooked. 5 In this book, known as the
Khazi'inul Futith, J have only narrated one out of a hundred events
from the conquest of Deogir to the conquest of Arangal. It will
be seen in this ‘Chapter of the Iron’® what Hindt kingdoms have
disappeared from the face of the earth, and how far the ‘Word of
Light ? has overcome the ‘ darkness of infidelity’ ; so that the success of
the Faith may be estimated from the light and the smoke. May the
Rindness of the Merciful bless the Emperor !

? T will also narrate some events of the reign of this Caliph, who is
Mohammad in name, Abi Bakr in truthfulness, and Umar in justice. I
will show how, like ‘Usman, he has brought the benevolent words of
God into the book of realization, how Jike ‘Ali he has opened the gates
of knowledge in the City of Islim, Delhi, with the key of his favour.
Through his munificence, which flows like the Tigres, he has raised
this Imperial City to the greatness of a new Baghdid. The Abbaside
standards, which had fallen down owing to great cataclysms, he has in
his Caliphate again raised upon foundations of justice.2 Through the
exercise of his strong judgment, he has maintained peace in the
countries of the world. And in all matters he has sought the aid of,
and held fast to Allah. Strange is his prosperity, for God holds his
wishes in special regard! For instance, fire is killed by water the
moment the two are united, yet if it crosses his mind that the two
elements should be married, the Diwin-i-Quza will at once perform
the ceremony’. The powers of nature are so much under his orders,
that though the earth is desolated by the wind and the wind is dusty
with the earth, yet if he gives the sign, the twain will be united and
the guardians of the atmosphere will turn the wind into water and mix
it with the earth. J/f his mind so desires, it ats nol imposstble that

fortune has been yet realized (May God always strengthen his
branches !), many victories blossomed on his sword and spear from
the Bihar’ of Lakhnauti to the Bihar of Malwa. He grew like a tree
in the territory of Karra py the bank of the Ganges and threw out
his branches (so wide) that he attained to the dignity of the ‘ Shadow
of God’. Wherever in the forest or by the bank of the river, there
was a mawds,> whether in cultivated land or wilderness, he trod it
underfoot with his army. Then on Saturday, the 19th Rabi‘ul Akhir,
AH. 695 he moved towards the garden of Deogir, from which
direction the spring comes; and striking its branches like a storm,
cleared them of their leaves and fruits. Ram Deo, a tree of noble
origin in that garden, had never before been injured by the tempestu--
ous wind of misfortune; but (the Sultan) in his anger first uprooted
him and then planted him again, so that he once more grew into a
green tree. Next, loading his elephants with precious stones as the
rainy season clouds (are laden with water), and placing bags of gold,
more in quantity than the saman-i-car* that grows on the earth, over
Bactrian camels and horses® swift as the wind, he arrived in Karra-
Manikptr on the 28th of Rajab, A.w. 695. Now that black-headed
éuléul, the pen, sings by its scratchings on paper, of the accession of
this tall cypress to the throne. From the first day of his accession till
now, A.H. 709, whichever way he has turned his bridle under the
shadow of the canopy, the odour of his conquests has been dissemina-

He will for ever preserve the memory of pious kings on the pages of

that this Moslem Moses was to seize their powerful swords from all
infidel Pharaohs and dig out of the earth the immense (Qéré#n?)
treasures of the rais, till the calf-worshipping Hindi in their hearts
began to consider the cow contemptible and the Emperor, with the
bow of Shu‘aib,? became the shepherd of all his subjects, therefore
the deceased Alf Khan * was sent to him as Aaron had been sent to
Moses. The hopeful message came to his ear: ' We will strengthen
your arm with your brother and we will give you both an authority.’
With the auspicious advice of his brother, the Imperial Moses

16th Ramazan, ava. 695. He gave away guitars after ginldrs® of
gold—' her colour is intensely yellow, giving delight to the beholder’

He distinguished himself by ravaging Chanderi, and then without Jalaluddin’s
permission, he marched to Deogir and plundered it. Rai Ram Deo had to pay
an enormous indemnity but was left in possession of his lands. On returning to
Karra, ‘Alauddin succeeded in prevailing on the Sultan, who was his uncle and
father-in-law, to come to see him unattended, and had him murdered during the
interview on the 16th Ramazan, a.w. 695 (Wednesday, July 17, 1296). Apart
from the Deogir exploit, these events were not creditable to ‘Alauddin, and Amir
Khbusrau, who was deeply attached to the murdered Sultan, has not attempted to
justify them. For more details, see Barn? and Ferishsia,

raised their hands in prayer : ‘O our Lord! Surely we are afraid that
he may hasten to do evil to us.’ The heavenly voice replied to give
them strength: ‘Fear not, surely I am with you.’ At the appointed
time the Emperor reached the precincts of the City. But as the
ruler of this side, with the pride of Pharaoh in his head, waited for
him on the bank of the blue Jamna, the inspiration from Heaven came
again to his heart: ‘Fear not, surely you will be the uppermost.’
So relying on his dragon-spear, he came to the precincts of the
Imperial Capital. On Monday, 22nd Zil Hijjah, a.s. 695 the
Emperot’s proclamation, ‘Obey my command!’ was heard from east
to west. And then owing to his justice he became the shepherd of the
people ; the wolf in killing goats became like the wolf of Joseph.

Lf Lane allowed, I will show the superiority of good government over the
glory of conquests. * Every man gifted with the crown of wisdom, if
he takes correct judgment for his guide, will after a little cogitation
come to the conclusion that the dignity of the ‘ruler’ is superior to
that of the ‘conqueror’. For the term ‘ruler’ is rightly applied to
Almighty God, while the title of ‘ conqueror’ cannot be legitimately
used for any but kings of the earth. Philosophers have said that the
conquest of the world is with the object of retaining it: the man, who
conquers but cannot retain, is in fact himself conquered. And it is
inevitable that when he seizes the world, the world should seize him
also. This, too, is clear as day to all men that the conquering and
keeping of the world is a quality of the sword of the sun; for
from east to west the sun brings the earth under the rays of his sword
and keeps it. But the mere conqueror is like a flash of lightning ;
for an instant he seizes the whole world and then immediately
disappears. The conqueror of this age (May God strengthen his
hand over the Capital and the provinces!) so highly excels in the
qualities of the ‘ruler’ as well as the ‘conqueror’, that neither the
pen nor the tongue can describe his powers. As a matter of necessity,
therefore, I will speak of his virtues in such manner as my
capacities allow; and according to the premises stated above, a

Account of the administrative measures that have been promulgated in
the reign of the Emperor, who is extremely devoted to this art :—*The
fortunate star of all mankind arose on the day when it was made
evident to the Emperor’s enlightened mind: ‘And against
these we have given you a clear authority.’3 For when I
raise up my eyes, I see that this exalted Dawn‘ has a greater love and
affection for the sons of Adam than the sun has for the moon and the
stars of the sky or the moon for the particles of the earth. In the
first place, throughout the Empire, from east to west and from north to
south, he has often remitted the tribute from the va’zyat. Secondly,
he has seized from the Hindi vais with the blows of his sword, just as
the sun absorbs water from the earth, treasures which they had
been collecting since the time of Mahraj and Bikarméaijit, star by star.
The public treasury is so full that it can be neither described by
the pen of Mercury nor weighed in the balance of Venus. He
gives away treasures by the balance of Virgo, so that people, who only
possessed copper, are drowned under /ankas 5 of gold and silver like
the Pisces. Ov the day of the Emperor's muniticence, the Balance in the
sky is lighter than the balances on the earth,

1 In spite of his dazzling conquests, it was as an administrator that ‘Alauddin
excelled. Amir Khusrau's florid rhetoric simply comes to this: it is much better
giving good government to your own subjects than to conquer foreign lands,
which you may or may not be able to retain. ‘One can do anything with
bayonets except sit upon them.’ It is to be regretted that in spite of his sensible
views, the author should have given us such a scanty account of ‘Alauddin’s
administrative and economic measures.

Account of ihe distribution of treasures of gold by clephant-loads and a
trifle more :-—' Before this time when Mahmud, the giver of gold, gave
away an‘elephant-load of gold, his great liberality became famous
through the world. But the Emperor distributes gold in a measure
which nothing can excel. He has ordered large elephants to be
weighed in boats, and the gold-bricks used in weighing them have been
given away to the poor. What monarch can rival the prince in whose
city treasures, weighed out by elephants, are given away.

Account of the distribution of horses switt as the wind, when every gitt
consisted of more than a hundred horses:—* If I were to describe his
gifts of horses, the stable of my praises would be unable to include
them. Kings are munificent; and the Emperor every day gives away
fortunes to the necessitous. It is seldom that he makes a smaller gift
than of a hundred or fifty (horses); but if he gives one horse only, it is
such that another like it cannot be found. With the blows of his sword
he has seized the stables of all the za@zs. Some of these horses
he gives to the horse-breakers, so that with the strokes of their whips
they may make the horses run as swift as deer. Others are given to
the pazks (footmen) so that they may ride on them with the help
of their sharp stirrups. The grooms (uwufridan-i-rakadb) are also given
horses, In former days the calves of the runners had grown thin from
running on foot, but now their feet seldom leave the stirrup. Some
horses are given to the az7s, who formerly owned unbroken colts but
now ride horses swift as the wind. As ¢thzs cloud 3 rains horses, there ts
no doubt that the rose, which was formerly a foot-man, will now come out
of the ground on horseback.

capacity of talking to the dumb (purchasers). Clever inspector
(mudatakhis) made full inquiries into the weight of the stones?. Every
dishonest (seller), who used his own black heart for his ‘ stone’, had ail
hardness knocked out of him. Severity and rigour reached such a
pitch that all ‘stones’ (weights) were made of iron and their correct
weight written upon them; so that if any one gave less than
the correct measure, the iron turned into a chain round his neck. If
he was impudent still, the chain became a sword and the extreme
punishment was meted out to him. When the shop-keepers saw this
severity, they did not meddle with the iron-weights ; in fact, they con-
sidered them to be castles of iron round their hearts and regarded the
inscriptions on the weights as amulets for the protection of their souls.
You might say that the inscriptions were really not on iron but on
hearts of iron. For on hearts such as these the Entperor's just regula-
tions came as easily as inscriptions on wax and remained as permanently as

Peace and order during the Emperors reign, when no one dare pick up

the name of robber, thief or pickpocket. Night-prowlers, who
formerly used to set villages on fire, now attend to travellers with

lose a piece of rope, either the rope is produced or compensation
given. Cutpurses, pickpockets and those who dig open graves? had
been busy in their profession from ancient times. But now the

of them are still sound in body, their hands and feet have become so
useless, that you would think they were born without them.

of the shari‘at ordered all members of the ‘ fraternity of incest’ to be
brought before him. Truthful inquisitors were appointed to catch
everyone of them and make thorough inquiries into their assemblies.
It was discovered that among these shameless wretches, mothers had
cohabited with their own sons and aunts (mother’s sisters) with
their nephews; that the father had taken his daughter for his bride
and there had been connection between brothers and sisters. Over
the head of all of them, men as well as women, the saw of punishment
was drawn. ... The saw with its heart of iron laughed loudly over
their heads in tears of blood. Those, who by a ‘secret stroke’
(Zarb-i-pinhan) had become one, were now openly sawed into two,
and ¢he soul that had sought union (wasl) wrth another soul, was now

tells us, ‘had the courage to profess a knowledge of alchemy or magic from fear
of the Emperor.’

3 This is confirmed by Barni. ‘In those years,’ he says, ‘ people who com-

were found out after a careful and diligent search and were put to death with
tortures. The saw of punishment was drawn over their heads and they were cut
intotwo. After this punishment the name of incest did not come to anyone’s
lips in the City.’ By the ‘fraternity of incest’ is meant the Carmathians,
Ismailes and other Shia ‘heretics’ of the sect of Seven Imams, whom the
‘orthodox’ Sunnis accused of permitting marriages within prohibited degrees
and of practising incest in their secret assemblies. The charge, whether right
or wrong, was generally believed. The Carmathians had captured Multin a

he has kept low the price of grain, from which villagers and citizens
derive an equal advantage, during periods when not a drop of rain
has fallen from the painted clouds. Whenever the white clouds have
had no water left and destruction has stared people in the face, he
has cheapened the price of grain for every section of the public by
generously opening the royal stores.! The clouds, consequently,
have felt ashamed at their own niggardliness and in envy of his
bountiful hands have dissolved into rain. To spur them on to this
act, the lightning has often langhed loudly over the heads of water-
laden clouds and then fallen on the ground.? For the lightning knows
well that the clouds sometimes rain and sometimes do not, and when
they rain, they rain water only. How can they be compared to our

describe in detail all the fine fruits that grow out of the ground, the
narrative would become too long and I would be kept back from my

Account of the sacred buildings, which the Emperor has constructed tor
the pleasure of God. * Because there is a secret understanding between
God and the Emperor concerning sacred and public works, he has
constructed such sacred buildings as strike the sky with wonder.
With a pure motive he began his series of buildings with the Royal
Juma Masjid (Masjid-2 Jama-i Hazrai).* He ordered a fourth court
(magstira), with lofty pillars to be added to the pre-existing three
courts; it was to be so high that the fourth heaven may-call it a
second Mecca. Ina day, stones like the sun were brought from the
sky, and the (structure of) stones rose from the earth to the moon.

permitted.

5 The Qutub Mosque, of which the Qutub Minar is a part, is known by various
names, ‘In histories’, Sir Syed Ahmad Khan says in the famous Asdrus Sanadid,
‘T have always seen this mosque referred to as the ‘Masjid-i-Adana-i-Delhi’ or the
‘Masjid-i Jama-i Delhi’ but never as the ‘ Masjid-i Quwwatul Islam’. It is not
known when the name of ‘ Quwwatul Islam’ was given to it but it might have
obtained this name when the temple was conquered and the mosque was built.
Such mosques are seldom known to the public by their real names but only Py

never end, has been started between heaven and earth. After this
wide and high edifice had been finished from top to bottom, other
mosques were built in the City, so strong that when the nine roofs of
the thousand-eyed sky fall down in the universe-quake of resurrection,
not an arch of these mosques will be injured. Next the columns of
the old mosques, whose walls were kneeling and bowing in prayer
and whose roofs were about to fall, were made to stand up so that
they once more became the ‘ pillars of faith’ and prayers were said in
them. The four walls (of the mosques) were strengthened and so
brilliantly plastered inside and outside that their light outdid the colour
of the azure sky.

Minar. ‘When by the grace of God * the decayed mosques had been

* The following extracts from the Asdrus Sanadid of Sir Syed Ahmad Khin
will enable the reader to attach a meaning to Khusrau’s florid narrative.

* The Incomplete Minar :—The Emperor ‘Alauddin was very desirous of fame.
Consequently when he ordered the extension of the (Qutub) Mosque in avy. 711
(A.D. 1311), he also commanded a new Afindr (tower) to be built in the courtyard
ofthe mosque, twice the size of theold (Qutub) Minar. The new Minar had a
circumference of one hundred yards and its foundations were laid in the Muslim
fashion—i.e., with a platform and the first door opening on the western side. It
was proposed to build the new Minar 200 yards high. But though the Emperor
had laid its foundations firmly, his own life was less secure; even the first storey
had not been finished when he died and the wonderful structure was left incom-
plete. Some parts of the incomplete Minar have fallen down; only a mass of
stones and lime is left.

* The Large Gate near the Qutub Altnar:—When Sultin ‘Alauddin became
Emperor and developed an ambition for public works, he built an enormous gate
for this mosque near the Qutub Minar in a.w.710 (a.p. 1311). This gate is
almost wholly of red sand stone, although here and there marble has been used.
On the four sides of the large gate he constructed four smaller gates, and on the
western, southern, and eastern gates he has put inscriptions with his name on
them. But many of the inscribed stones have fallen down and rain has eaten into
many letters. The roof of the gate consists of a heavy dome, Everywhere there is
fine inlaid and mosaic work, and ‘traditions’ and verses from the Quriin have
been inscribed.

* The Court of (the Qutub Afosque) :—After the gate was finished, the Emperor
ordered a fourth court (darja) to be added to the mosque. The court in the centre
had been constructed by Sultaa Mutizzuddin, and the two courts on either side of
it by Suit{n Shamsuddin. ‘Alduddin’s court was 115 yards long, counting three
feet to the yard ; the foundations of nine coors had been laid and the central door
was sixteen yards. In a.H. 711 (A.p. 1511) the court was being built; but
‘unfortunately the Emperor died in a.w. 715 (A.D. 1315) and the mosque was left
incomplete. If the edifice had been completed, the whole mosque would have
measured 241 yards in length from east to west, and 132 yards in breadth from
north to south. On the northern side the Emperor began the construction ‘of a

so firmly repaired, that like the sacred Ka‘bah they became safe from
destruction, the Emperor's noble ambition prompted him to build a
peer to the high Minar-i-Jami, a structure unrivalled throughout the
world. The dome of sky was to be bestowed on the (new) Minar, for
it could not rise higher than that. First, he ordered the courtyard of
the mosque to be extended as much as possible, so that the ‘ fraternity
of Islam’, which is fortunately too large for the whole world, may yet
be contained in this world within a world. Next, in order to make the
Minar strong, and to carry it so high that the dome of the old AZinar
might look like an arch of the new, he ordered its circumference to be
twice that of the old Minar. On a sign from the Emperor, the planets,
who are the shop-keepers of the sky, began to move their chariots.
Mercury became busy in buying iron and stone and the moon began to
drive the Taurus. Yes, when the ‘ House of God’ is being built, the
stars have to carry stones on their heads! And if they refuse to stir
from their places, the Afindr itself will rise up to them and strike their
heads with stones. People were sent to search for stones on all sides.
Some struck the hills with their claws, and as they were anxious to
find stones, they tore up the hill-side to pieces like lovers.! Others
were keener than steel in overturning infidel buildings. They
sharpened their iron instruments, went to wage a holy war againstt he
castles of the (old) rdis, and fought a ferocious battle against the
stones with their muscles of steel. Wherever an idol temple had
kneeled down in prayer, the ‘arguments’ of the strong-tongued spade
removed the foundations of infidelity from its heart, till finally the
temple placed its head in thanksgiving on the ground.* The stone
slabs bore ancient inscriptions made by the ‘Preceptor of Angels’3;
but as the pen of Destiny had ordained that all these stones would have
the good news—‘ Indeed he builds the mosques of Allah’—written

door, but that, too, was left unfinished. ‘There was fine mosaic work on all these
incomplete buildings, and texts and ‘‘ traditions’? had been inscribed. It is not
known who removed these (inscribed) stones but it is clear that they have been
removed. Nothing is now left except (plain) stones and lime’.

1 In allusion to Farhad, the lover of Shirin, who perforated a huge mountain
to please his mistress,

places of worship and had fallen down, were touched. A temple used as a place
of worship was inviolable by the Imperial Law.

upon them, they thrust the point of their pickaxes into the hard hearts
(of the buildings) and threw (the stones) to the ground. Then the
iron of the shovels, having turned into a magnet in contrariety to its
nature, drew the stones to itself, and labourers with bodies of steel
brought these stones from temples a hundred farsangs away. The
stony back of the mosque had a large mass of stones put upon it;
stones, stich as the sky could not have drawn to itself, were taken to
the sky; and rocks, such as the mountains could not hold on their
backs, were brought upon the backs of the animals.

The stone-cutters of Hind, who excel Farhad in their art, took out
their hatchets and smoothed the stones so artistically, that if
imagination nad put its feet upon them, it would have certainly
slipped. The masons of Delhi, who consider Ni‘man Manzar a novice
in the art of building, used their professional skill and joined stone to
stone so that there was no danger of any secret crevice or cavity
remaining between them. The doors and walls of the mosque, which
formerly performed their éeyam2n1 with the dust, have now been
raised so high that they perform their ablutions with water from the
clouds. This has happened in the year a.u. 711. To carry it higher,
human life must be based on a foundation firmer than that of the
Minar; only then could the tower, which has risen ont of the earth, be
carried to the sky. And though I wish to see it finish, my life will
have to be long before I am able to witness its completion and send
my blessings to its pious founder. Besides my sight cannot reach its
end » Tam one of those who come and see and depart.

Construction of the strong fort of the City, in which a second wall o
Alexander * appeared on the face of the globe :-—*The fort of Delhi, the
deputy of the sacred Ka’ba, had fallen down. Owing to the ravages
of time, it was in a condition of dilapidation worse than that which
has overtaken taverns * in the reign of the august Emperor. Like a
man dead drunk, it had fallen down in place and out of place,
quite unable to keep its stones together. Sometime it placed its head

on the ground before the common people of the public highway; on
other occasions, it had bowed down in salutation to the worthless ditch.
Its towers had once been so high that a man’s hat fell down if
he attempted to look at them; but now, from continued ill-treatment,
they lay down to sleep on the earth, When the ‘Alai era of public
works arrived (May it last for ever!), the Emperor ordered stones
and bricks of gold to be taken out of the flourishing exchequer and
spent in defraying the expenses of the fort.t Skilful masons applied
themselves to the work and a zew fort was quickly built in place of the
old. The new fort with its strong forearm and seven towers shakes
hands with the coloured Pleiades, squeezes the powerful Mars under
its arm-pit, and uses the high sky as a sort of waistband. It is
a necessary condition that blood be given to a new building; conse-
quently, many thousand goat-bearded A/ughals have been sacrificed for
the purpose. When the edifice—-many congratulations to its founder—
was completed, the Guardian of the Universe took it under His protec-
tion. How will any trouble or insurrection tind its way to the place of
which God is the guardian ?

Construction of other forts, which, owing to the Emperors favour, now
raise their heads to the sky:—* When the masons of the Imperial
capital had been recompensed for the buildings in the City, the
Emperor ordered that wherever in any part of the Empire there was a
fort, which had been affected by the moist winds of the rainy season,
or was about to doze or go to sleep, or had opened wide its cracks
and cast away its teeth (from old age), or grew yellow flowers in

1 ' The ‘Aldi Delhi, or ‘ Alai Fort or Koshak-i Siri :—This fort was built by
Sultan ‘Alaguddio Khilji. When in a.u. 703 (A.D. 1303) the Emperor marched
against Chitor in person and at the same time sent a large force against Warangal
in Telingana, Targhi and the Mughals came and laid siege to Delhi, expecting to
find itempty. But after many battles the Emperor was victorious. Afterwards
he built thisfort. A village, called Sri, existed here at that time; consequently,
the fort was also known as the fort of Siri. In Sher Shah’s time it was called the
** Koshak-i Siri’*. The fort, as built by ‘Alauddin, was circular, with strongly built
walls of stone, brick and lime, and had seven gates. Before the fort was comple-
ted, another battle with the Mughals took place, and eight thousand Mughal heads
were used in place of stones in building the walls of the fort. Though the fort has
quite crumbled down, yet some traces of it are found on the left hand side

, When going to the Qutub Min&r, In a.u.96 Sher Shah pulled down the fort of
Siri and built a new city near Old Delhi (i.e., Indarpat). A village, named Shah-

Account of the Royal Tank (Hauz-i-Sultani), which holds the water of

Tank’ ,* will (aow) shine like the sun till the dawn of resurrection.
But (formerly) the sun every day made it a mirror for seeing its own
face, and it reflected back the light of the sun. But as the latter
shone hotly upon it, it slowly sank down out ofrespect forthesun. ‘If
your water should go down,’ the stn asked in its rage, ‘ who is it then
that will bring you flowing water?’ And the tank dried up from
fear. This year the revolving sky flared up all of a sudden, and the
water of the tank evaporated so thoroughly that its bottom cracked
and broke into pieces. In his contempt for the ‘ king of the planets,’
the ‘Emperor of the world’5 ordered the sand and mud to be
removed from the bottom of the tank. And as the sun from on high
had been drying up its water, a dome, such as put that luminary into
falling fits, was built overit. Then rain came on, and the ‘eyes’ of
the clear-hearted tank, which had dried up at the sun, were again
filled with water. Strange the sympathy of the tank, that it should
weep (at the helplessness) of the sun! But such is the custom of
noble persons. Immediately sweet water became available in the

City and a tumult rose up from the City wells. But though it had
rained once through the kindness of Heaven, the bottom of the tank
was too dry to become moist with a single draught. All clear water,
that fell from the cloud, sank into the earth like the treasure of Qériin.}
2 There can be no doubt that Delhi is a city, which even the Nile and the
Euphrates cannot provide with sufficient drinking water. And so the
people of the City were faced with the same destruction that had
threatened the followers of Moses. The Emperor—whose sharp
sword has thrown the Pharaohs of infidelity into the Nile, or, to put it
differently, whose Nile-like sword has been drowned in the yellow
blood of Jewish tempered? tunic-weavers—in this general scarcity
of water, when even the Jamna had become dry, raised up his ‘ white
hand’, like Moses, to pray to God for water. Immediately, in proof
of the text,—' And we made the clouds to give shade over you ’—the
shadow (of his hand) fell over a little dry earth, The spades and the
pickaxes in the hands of the excavators became like the staff of
Moses. Two or three springs appeared on the four sides of the
embankment (chautra). ‘So there flowed from it twelve springs;
each tribe knew its drinking place.” In a few days the water reached
the edge of the embankment; and having met it (the embankment)
after a long time, the water shook hands with it and hugged it with
a hearty embrace, just as the sea embraces the Jand. Khusrau has
written these lines in praise of the tank and its dome: ‘ Zhe dome
in the centre of the tank is like a bubble on the surface of the sea. If you
see the dome and the tank rightly, you wtil say that the former zs like an
ostrich egg, half in water and halt out of it+4

that the tank was constructed of red stone, but now itis quite broken and only a
lake is left. This lake is 276 pukhta dighas in area. What, then, must have
been the extent of the tank when it was in good repair? In a.m. 7ilasit had
been filled up with mud, Sultan ‘Alauddin had it dredged; and exactly in-its
centre he constructed a platform over which he built a very beautiful dome
(6ur7i). This dome exists till to-day. Firoz Shah, too, repaired the tank in his
reign and cleared the passages by which the water used to come. But now the
tank has been nearly filled up with earth, and water does not remain jn it for more
than three or four months’ (Asarws Sanadrd),

CHAPTER III

CAMPAIGNS AGAINST THE MUGHALS

1 As the public works which have been, and are being, constructed
by this pious builder (May he live for ever !), surpass what the pen

1 Allusions to territories and forts,

The Mughals or Mongols, who are the heroes of this chapter, require some
introduction. They were first brought into prominence by Chengiz Khan in the
beginning of the thirteenth century. The early life of Chengiz was spent in a
protracted struggle against the surrounding tribes, but he emerged victorious
through a combination of craft and guile, brutal strength and constructive states-
manship. His election as ‘Khan’ of the Mongolian tribes was followed by a
reorganization of his people as the most efficient fighting machine in the world,
organized on a system of universal conscription and blind obedience to orders.
Chengiz first invaded China and-then attacked the Khwarazmian Empire with an
army of 800,000. No power in the Muslim world was able to withstand him.
City after city fell before the barbarians, and Sultan Alauddin Mohammed
Kbwarazm Shah died in one of the islands of the Caspian to which he had fled for
refuge. Chengiz retired to his own country from the eastern bank of the Indus,
but the empire he had founded persisted for three generations, and was a terror
to all mankind.

Chengiz Khan had four sons. Juji (or Tushi), the eldest, died in the life-
time of his father, but Juji’s son, Batu, conquered Southern Russia, Bulgaria
and part of Poland and founded his dynasty there. Ogtai, the eldest surviving
son, succeeded Chengiz as ‘ Khan,’ ‘Qa-an’ or ‘Khaqan.’ Chaghtai and Tului
were given domains under the suzerainty of their brother. Ogtai was succeeded
by his son, Kayuk (or Kapak), but after Kayuk’s short reign, the unity of the
empire disappeared. The guiriliaz or assembly of Mongol princes, representing
the majority, elected Mangu, son of Tului, tothe ‘ Khakanship’ in 1251, but Qaidu
Khan, supported by the descendants of Chaghtai and Ogtai, established himself
in Mawaraun Nahr and maintained his independence till his death in 1301. In
spite of this rift in the lute, the guiri/fai of 1251 launched two important
expeditions. Kublai, brother of Mangu (the*' Kubla Khan’ of Coleridge), was
sent against China, while his younger brother, Halaku Khan, was despatched
against the ‘ heretics’ (Zssai/es) of Persia. Halaku first captured the forts of
the ‘heretics’ and then proceeded to overthrow the Caliph of the orthodox.
Baghdad was captured and sacked in-1258 and Halaku’s descendants, known as
the ‘I-1 Khan’s,’ while acknowledging the formal superiority of the ‘ Khakan,’
continued to govern Persia in practical independence during the thirteenth
century. Meanwhile in the east Mangu was succeeded by Qublai, who completed
the conquest of the Chinese empire.

The early successes of the Mongols had been due to the strength of their
military organization, the genius of their leaders and the hardships, which the
rank and file were prepared to bear. A generation of civilization sufficed to
degenerate them. The I-] Khans of Persia became Mussalmans and adopted
Persian ways. The successors of Qublai were driven pell-mell out of China to
their barbaric land and its barbaric ways.

with the description of those given above in acknowledgment of my
own limitations. Now I will move my tongue, which is surrounded
by wise teeth, and describe some of the victories this world-conquering

he has conquered and the forts he has reduced. Thus I will bring

from A.H. 694 to 703 and Ghazan’s brother, Khuda Bandah Aljaitu Sultan, who
ruled from 4.u. 703 to 716. While the ruling dynasty had accepted Islam, many
soldiers and officers adhered to their old faith. But whether Mussalman or infidel,
the Mongols had not forsaken their old plundering habits and their taste for
bloodshed, as the career of Timur conclusively shows,

A detailed account of the Mongols will be found in Sir Henry Howorth’s
History of the Mongols, 4 vols. a monument of careful and painstaking scholar-
ship. Sir Henry has depended mostly on translations and has, therefore, not been
able to give as graphic an account of the character of the Mongols and their
social system as some of the early Persian writers. The earliest account of the
Mongols seems to be the Zabagat-iNasiri of Minhajus Siraj Jurjani of Delhi,
The author had a first-hand knowledge of the Chengizi Mongols, against whom
he had fought, and regarded them witha bitter hatred. Writing at a safe distance
from the barbarians, Qazi Minhajus Siraj had no hesitation in abusing the
* Mughal infidels,’ and the thirteenth chapter (¢a6agah) of his work, devoted to the
‘ Rise of the Mongols’, reads like a thrilling short story. The military superiority
of Chengiz Khan had convinced the learned Qazi that the Day of Judgment was
near and he quotes chapter and verse to prove this. Some chapters (including
the thirteenth) of the Zadagat-iNasiri have been printed by the Royal Asiatic
Society of Bengal and the inestimable Col. Raverty devoted twelve years to
translating it into English. The most reliable history of the Mongols is the
Tarikh-iJahan Gusha of ‘Alaiiddin Ata Malik Juwayni, who compiled his work
in thetime of Halaku Khan. ‘The first two volumes of Juwayni book, comprising
an account of the Khwarazmians and Mongols, have been excellently edited for
the Gibb’s Memorial Series by Mr. Mohammad ibn-i ‘Abdul Wahhab Qazwini.
A later work, the Jami‘ut Tawarikh of Rashiduddin, who wrote in the time of
Aljaitu sultan, incorporates much fresh information and continues the history of
Chengiz Khan’s successors. The first volume of the Jami'ut Tawarikh is said to
have been printed in Russia; the second volume on the ‘ Successors of Chengiz
Khan’ has been edited by Mr. Blochet’for the Gibb’s Memorial Series. Three
other Persian histories may here be mentioned—the Tarikh of Wassaf, who was
a contemporary of Rashiduddin, the Zarikh-iGuzidah of Hamd€ullah Mustawfi
and the Rauzatus Safa of Mohammad ibn-i Khawind Shah. All these writers
rely mostly on the Tarikh-i-Jahan Gusha and the Jami‘ut Tawarikh.

The word Mongol requires some explanation. Early writers generally say
‘Maghil,’ but in later writers the Waw is dropped. The‘'n’ of ‘Mongol’ is not
found in Persian writers. Stillit is convenient to apply the word ‘ Mongol’ to
Chengiz Khan and his successors and reserve the word ‘ Mughal’ for the Indian
Emperors of the House of Babar, who though belonging to the same race,
represented a different culture and civilization. But where the Persian text says
‘ Mughal,’ I have kept that word, :

The tirst victory of the Iinperial) Army over the gluttons of Kadar in
the contines of Jéran Manjtr. >This is the account of the victory,
which the champions of the triumphant army obtained, for the first
time during the reign of this Sanjar-like Sultan (May God protect
his standards !) over the soldiers of the accursed Kadar in the land
of Jaran Manjir. When the subtle Tatar, accompanied by an army
like an avenging deluge, came as presumptuous as ever from the
Judi mountains, and crossed the Bias, Jelum and Sutlej,? the advanc-
ing wave of the hellites burnt down all the villages (¢alwarah?) of
the Khokars, so that the lames illuminated the suburbs of the City,
and the buildings of Qustir were demolished. Such a wailing arose
that the sound of it reached the august Emperor of the world.+.
5The late Ulugh Khan, the arm of the state, was sent with the
tight wing of the army, supported by great generals and troops, to
wage a holy war. He was lo go to the infidels to show them his
Strong and closed fist. ©The Khan, whose bow was like that of Arsh,”
flew as fast as one of his own arrows; and making two marches in
one, he reached the borders of Jaran of Manjtr, the field of battle. Only
the distance of a bowshot remained between the two armies. On
Wednesday, the 22nd Rabi'ul Akhir, Ava. 697 the great Muslim Khan
came into contact with the infidels. He ordered the standard-bearers
to bind the victorious standards to their backs; for the sake of
their honour, they turned their faces towards the Sutlej, and without the
aid of boats, ¢hey swam over the river, striking out their hands® like oars
impelling a boat. °The Mughals seemed very brave before the
victorious army had plunged into the river; but when the wave of
Muslim troops reached the middle of the stream, they gave way.
Unable to bear the fire of the sword, they fled desperately; and
though in number like ants and locusts, they were trampled under the
feet of the horsemen like an army of ants. The Afughals wished to

sink into the ground; for the sword was so busy on the bank that
blood flowed like swab 1 on the river. The champions of the army
could split a hair of the eyelash without injuring the eye; and in the
twinkling of an eye, they had sewn up the stony eyeballs of some
Mughals as you might sew up the eyes of a hawk, while their arrows
pierced the iron hearts of others as a key goes into alock. When a
breast, like a rusty lock, refuses to open, tt should be opened in no other way
than this. In short, twenty thousand ferocious Mughals were sent /o
sleep on the ground in mourning at their own death by the powerful
(Imperial) lions. A very large part of Kadar’s army (¢mdan) was cut
to pieces with blows of axe and spear. Some Mughals whose bones
had been ground to powder, were sent off to their journey? in that
condition. Others had become unconscious through fear, but life still
remained in their bodies ; their heads were cut off, and so they departed
without their heads. Most of the survivors were imprisoned.

5 Why Qaidu?

It is to be regretted that while Indian historians supply us with sufficient infor-
mation to enable us to piece together a complete account of the Mongol invasions
of India in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the Persian writers referred to in
a preceding note, give us the vaguest information on the subject or else ignore it
completely, Of course a raid on Indian territory led by a general of secondary
importance was an insignificant matter for the historian of an empire extending
from Peking to Moscow. But there was also another reason for their silence.

Ziauddin Barni throughout speaks of the Mongols coming {rom Mawaraun
Nahr. He says that Kitlugh Khwaja, who besieged Delhi in the fourth year of
‘ Alauddin’ sreigu, was a son of Quda, king of Mawaraun Nahr, and Targhi, who
was present in that as well as later campaigns, is first brought into prominence as
a general of Katlugh Khwaja. Quda is probably a misreading for Qaidu. We
have seen that in the guiril/ai of 1251 the Chaghtai and Ogtai princes refused to

both Turks of the tribe of Qai (vomit) and the eaters of vomit (ga?),
the victorious army of the Khalifa (May he reign for ever ') prepared
to return, The late Ulugh Khan (May God give him pure wine to
drink !) first held a pleasure-party to commemorate the great victory
and scattered gold and jewels among his comrades of war and peace.
“Then intoxicated with happiness, he spurred his horse to kiss the
ground before the Imperial Court. The prisoners, who looked like
the teeth of mad elephants, were put to death. Meanwhile, the
Emperor, like Kai-Khusrau,? had seen the image of this victory in the
world-compassing mirror of his own mind, and moved his tongue in
gratitude at the realization of his wishes. ‘If you are grateful, I
would certainly give to you more.’* He then gave himself up to
rejoicings.. He called the.commanders (44aus) of the left and right
‘wings? to a great feast, and bestowed such favours on the citizens
and the army, that they were freed from all labour (God protect us
‘from it "). Tf you asked water in alms from a beggar, he would give you

acknowledge the ‘Khakanship’ of Mangu and set up an independent kingship
under Qaidu in Mawaraun Nahr and Turkestan. This division of Mongol power
saved the kingdom of Delhi, which could not have withstood a united attack of
the Mongols. The I-! Khans of Persia naturally paid homage to Mangu and his
successors, who like them were descendants of Tului, but they were constantly
_at war with the Mameluks of Egypt in Syria, and, more often than not, had the
worse of it. It is the Chaghtat and Ogtai princes of Mawaraun Nahr who are
responsible for the invasions described in this chapter. They were being hard-
pressed by the ‘Khakan’ in the west and by ‘I-]1 Khans’ in the east and this
naturally made them anxious to carve ont principalities for themselves elsewhere.
An account of the fortunes of the House of Qaidu will be found in Howorth,
vol. i, pp. 173-82, but Persian writers, as a rule, have confined themselves to
an account of the ‘Khaqans’ and ‘I-!] Khans’, in whose eyes Qaidu was a rebel.

‘In the same year, A.H. 696 the Mughal danger arose. Some Mughals cross-
ed the Sindh (Indus) and came into the country. Ulugh Khan and Zafar [chan
with the Jalali and ‘AlAi airs and a large army were sent against them. The
army of Islam gave the accursed foe battle within the boundaries of Jalandar.
The Muslim banner was victorious. Many Mughals were captured and killed and
their heads were brought to Delhi (Sarnz),

"In the same year Dawa Khan, the ruler of Mawaraun Nahr, sent some
hundred thousand Mughals to Hindustan with the object of conquering the
provinces of Punjab, Multan and Sindh. The Mughals crossed the river Sindh
and left nothing undone in the way of spoliation, plunder and destruction. When

This is the account of another victory of the Muslim army over, the
Mughals. * When ‘Afi Beg, Tartiq and Targhi came with drawn swords
from the borders of Turkestan to the river Sind (Indus), and after
crossing the Jelum like an arrow, turned their faces in this direction,
Targhi, who had once or twice fled away from the attacks of the
victors, already saw his bald head on the spears of the champions of
Islam, like a wine cup placed over a ladle. Although he had an iron
heart, yet he dare not place it within the reach of the anvil-breaking
watriors of God. But he was at last shot by an arrow, which pene-
trated his heart and passed to the other side. ‘Ali Beg and Tartaa,
who had never been to this country before, mistook the arched swords
of Musalmians for those of mere preachers. They ventured with
single heads on their shoulders into a country, where if a man brought
a thousand heads, he couid not take one of them back. They had
fifty thousand trained and ferocious horsemen; the hills trembled
at their tread. The confounded inhabitants at the foot of the hills
fled away at the fierce attack of these wretches and rushed to the
fords of the Ganges. But the lightning of Mughal fury penetrated to
that region also and smoke arose out of the towns of Hindustan.?
People fied from their burning houses, and with their heads and feet
on fire, threw themselves into rivers and torrents. At last from these
desolated tracts news came to the Imperial Court. The Emperor
sent his confidential officer, Malik Naik, dzAar Beg-iMaisarah,
with thirty thousand powerful horsemen, and directed him to
slaughter without stint and to shoot such an arrow at the accursed
mark as might create a fearful rent in their work (strategy). Across

this news was brought to the Emperor, he sent Ilmas Bég, Ulugh Khan and
Hizhabruddin Zafar Khan with an enormous army to suppress them. The two
armies met each other within the confines of Lahore; a fearful battle took place
and the Mughals were defeated. Some twelve thousand Mughals were put to the
sword; many of their leading Amizrvs were captured and put to death with
tortures. Ulugh Khan sent the heads of the Mughals to Delhi along with their
wives and children.’ (Fvrishfa).

Lahore could not have been the seat of battle, which according to Amir
Khusrau took place by the side of the Sutlej. In the Dawal Rani, Amir Khusrau
calls the place ‘ Manjiir-i-jaran,’ the name being twisted to suit the rhyme. The
‘Qar Maikhir’ of Yabagat-iAkbart is apparently a misreading for ‘ Jaran
Manjir.’ I am inclined to agree with Barni, or rather his editor, in identifying
Jaran Manjiir with Jalandhar.

a distance which was longer than the day of the idle, the victorious
army passed more quickly than the lives of the busy. On Thursday,
12 Jamadius Sani, ava. 705 they overtook the doomed enemy.
Immediately on seeing the dust of the Muslim army, the grovelling
Mughals became like particles of sand, revolving above and below.
Hard-lived though they were, their souls fed out of them; nor
could their iron hearts remain in their places to serve as anchors for
their souls. Like a swarm of gnats warring against a hurricane, in
proportion to their attempt to move forward, they were taken further
back. And the Angel of Death cried out to them: ‘ Flight shall
not do you any good if you fly from death or slaughter.’ From
necessity (rather than choice), they made a feeble attack though their
enthusiasm had declined. But the army of the Second Alexander,
which you might call an iron wall, was not a thing that would bend.
It drove away those doers of the deeds of Gog ; and in expectation of
Divine assistance—t and He has sent an army, which you do not
see ’—the sharp sword began to do its work. Soon fite-coloured faces
fell to the ground. One would think that the Muslim swordsmen
were throwing balls of fire over running water. In this universal
cutting of heads, ‘Ali Beg and Tartaq, the two ‘heads’ of the
Mughals, saw the sword above them and the time of their fall near.
Their faces grew dark from the blazing heat of the all-conquering
sword, and they threw themselves under the shade of the Muslim
standard. ‘The rays of the sword have struck us with such a fire,’
they said, ‘that we will never be satisfied till we have reached the
* Shadow of God”?’.. The man laid low with mistoriunes cannot tind
happiness anywhere except under the‘ shadow of God’.

2 The field of battle, strewn with elephant-bodied Mughals, looked
like a chess-board. Their faces (castles) had been cut into two with
the sword, and their bodies, pounded with the clubs (gz7z), looked
like bags for holding the chess-men. The dead Mughal lay right and
left like so many captured pieces. Of the ‘horses’ (knights) which
had filled the squares, some had been knocked down with blows and
others had been captured. Such knights, as after the manner of
pawns, refused to go back, were turned into foot-men (pawns), and

since they moved still further, they became farzz7 (queens), i.e. they
were made to place their heads on the ground.’ ‘Ali Beg and Tartaq,
the two kings of the chess-board, were checkmated by their large-
boned enemy, the Malik Akhur Beg, who wished to send them to the
Emperor, so that ke may either spare their lives or else cast them under
the feet of the elephants (bishops). * When Satan’s puppets, i.e. the
infidel troops, were brought bound before the Imperial throne, the two
adventurers, who had claimed equality (with the Sultan), cast their
eyeballs like dice on the carpet of submission, and appealed to the
Emperor's manliness in order to save their lives. Two different
orders were given concerning these ‘red and white ones’;3 some
were to be put to death and others imprisoned. The two captured
pieces,* who had hitherto remained in suspense, were brought to their
prison and freed from the danger of death. In the course of time one
of them died, without any harm having been done to him, and the
other remained alone. Zhe Amperor was so successful in the sport that
he took their lives in one game atter another?

5 During the eight years, a.z. 697 to 705 Delhi was twice besieged, first by
Kutlugh Khwaja and then by Targhi. Amir Khusrau was not ignorant of these
events; he refers to Kutlugh Khwaja and Tarzhiin the Dawal Rani and he speaks
in the above passage of Targhi’s previous esperience of India. But respect for
‘Alauddin’s dignity required an omission of the two most important Mughal
campaigns. ,

This campaign is described by most historians. ‘On one occasion’ says
Barni, ‘ ‘Ali Beg and Tartaq were the leaders of the Mughal army. They were
famous men and ‘Ali Beg was reputed to be a descendant of the accursed Chengiz.
Skirting the mountains, they reached the territory of Amroha with thirty or forty
thousand men. Sultan ‘Alauddin sent Malik Naik, the d&éhur Beg, with the
Muslim army against them. The two forces came to battle within the confines of
Amroha and God gave victory to the army of Islam. ‘Ali Beg and Tart&q were
both captured alive. The larger part of the Mughal army was put to the sword,
scattered and dispersed. The slain Mughals were piled up on the field of battle
like stacks of corn. Ropes were fastened round the necks of ‘Ali Beg and Tartiq
and they were brought before the Sultan with many other Mughal prisoners.
Twenty thousand horses belonging to the Muchals were brought before the Court.
A magnificent darbar was prepared at the Chautra-iSubhani, The Sultan sat in
public audience and the army stood in a double row from the royal seat to
Indarpat. Owing to the enormous multitude, the price of a cup of water rose to
twenty jilals or half-a-tanka, Through such a crowd, ‘Ali Beg and Tartaq,
together with other Mughals and their baggage, were taken to the throne,

Account of another victory and the slaughter of the Mughal tumans,
who had raised an uproar under the dog, Kapak. 4 When the fierce 2.
infidel army (God destroy it!) came proudly like autumn into the
garden of Hindustan, the southernmost of the fertile countries,
towards the end of Diy,? dust arose from the borders of the land of
Sind and the inhabitants threw away their property and dispersed like
autumnal leaves. But the storm of destruction, being unable to raise
any dust in the regions of Kohram and Samana, turned towards the
wilderness of Nagore, and overpowered the inhabitants of that region.
When the stench of these doomed carcass-eaters led by a hound
increased, the sweet Nagori rose, which smells like rubbed sandal-
wood, turned fetid. Messengers fast as the wind brought news of
this stench to the perfumed palace of the victorious Emperor, whose
virtues are fragrant like the navel of a musk-deer. In abhorrence of
those men with stinking brains, he ,ordered the Muslim army to pro-
ceed against them; but the news was to be kept a secret, lest in fear
of the approaching sandal, the horrid stench should fly back to the fra-
grant willows of Khorasan. The Malik of fragrant virtues, ‘ Izzud-
doulah waddin Kaftr-i Sultanit (May the Imperial Court be perfumed
with his talents !) was appointed to lead the army. The deer-riding
lions went so quickly that they made no distinction between the dark-
ness of night and the light of dawn till they had reached their
stinking prey. And when the turmeric-coloured dust of the holy

The captive Mughals were cast under the feet of elephants. And stream of blood
did flow’.

The commander of the army of Islam, on this occasion, wasa Hindu. The
Mir'at-i Sikandar? says that Naiks are a tribe of ontcaste Rajpiits. Be this as it
may, the surname ‘ Naik’ iscommon enough to-day. The following lines from
Khusrau’s Dawal Rani leave no doubt as to Malik Naik’s religion. ‘As he
(Targht) wished to injure the Faith through his infidels, Fate decreed that he
should meet his death at the-hands of an infidel (Hindi). The soil of the
wilderness drank the blood of the armies of ‘Ali Beg and Tartaq when the two
Turkish Khans were suddenly captured by a Hindi slave (servant) of the Court
and the conflagration was quelled by the sharpness of the Imperial sword.’

Nizamuddin contents himself with summarising Barni. Ferishta has Tarqal
Khwaja for Tartaq, and says that the Muslim army was commanded by Malik
M§nik (an obvious misreading for Malik Naik) and Ghazi Malik Tughlaq. ‘The
Sultan ’, he adds, ‘ distributed the captured horses equally among the amirs and
ordered the eight thousand Mughal heads, which had been brought, to be used
instead of stones and bricks for the towers of Siri, which were then being built.’

warriors had bathed the anice-smelling Mughals, the latter also became
fragrant. 4 On the banks of the Ab-i ‘Ali? the Mughals were over-
taken by a weak wave from the swelling stream of Muslim enthusiasm,
The accursed Kapak fell into a rushing torrent of swords and began to
strike out his hands and feet; the sharp sword was about to cut off his
head, when the kind-hearted Mussalmans rushed in from all sides and
took him prisoner, in order to send the water-dog with the other
aquatics to the Imperial Court. All the followers of Kapak were
either killed or imprisoned ; some were shot with arrows and became
coid where they stood; the rest had still some water from the stream
of life left, but the wind of Divine wrath blew against them and they
were put into chains.

Another Mughal army, under Iqbal Mudbir 3? and Mudabir Tai Bu,
followed close behind Kapak’s, thirsty for the blood of Mussalmans,
but well filled with the blood of their own tribes. Suddenly a
torrent of blood of the slaughtered infidels flowed towards them,
but as they were well accustomed to such a flood, they dived to the
bottom. The swelling stream of blood, however, reminded them of
the sharp sword; for a great Slaughter was awaiting them. Though
they tried to strike out their feet, they found no space to stand on.
Meanwhile the van of the Muslim army advanced like clouds and rain,
and fell like a raging storm on these men from Jaihtin. All of
them fied from the rain of arrows, and wished like dogs to seek
refuge in any gutter. On every side the army advanced like
waves of a deluge ¢hat goes over mountains and caverns with tumult and
noise. * News was brought to the commander of the Muslim troops 5
that the Mughals had two heads, one Iqbal and the other Tai Bi.
When the right wing of the Imperial army fell upon them, they lost all
consciousness of hand and feet, and the two Mughal leaders were

* Ferishta says Nilab; Barni and Nizamuddin say the battle took place at
Khakar. According to the Dawal Rani, ‘the Mughals crossed the territory of
Multan and began to ravage the land of the Ravi.’ This seems more accurate. I
am inclined to believe that the advance guard under Kapak first came to Multan
and then marched up the river Ravi which in those days flowed near Multan, After
the defeat of Kapak on the bank of the Ravi, the Mughal contingents of Iqbal and
Tai Bu tried to fly away across the same ford of the Indus. Khusrau gives no
dates for this invasion and his geographical references are perplexing,

flying by the same passage across the Sind (Indus). But as they had
forgotten their ‘feet’, neither did their ‘feet’ remember their
‘heads’; and it was high time for the Imperial sword to strike off
their ‘ heads’ and throw them before their ‘ hands’ and ‘feet’!1 2So
by the fraan of the commanders of the army, bold and strong-armed
warriors took their swords in hand, spurred their horses across the
extensive desert and soon overtook the retreating Mughals. In that
garden of death heads were struck off and necks were cut open, so
that the sword sometimes reached the throat and sometimes the waist.
Owing to the sword of the holy warriors, the deluge of blood came up to the
nose of the infidels, yet not a drop of blood came out of a Aussalman’s nose.
When the victorious army, which had girded up its loins for holy war
in defence of the Faith of the Lord, saw conclusive proof of the text,
—‘* And surely Allah will help him who helps His cause'—it enacted
the scenes of resurrection on the innumerable bodies of these accursed
wretches. You would have thought that the Day of Judgment had
arrived, and that the angels of the Lord were collecting the dead bodies
of stony-hearted infidels to light the fire of Heil, ‘of which men and
stones are the fuel.’ Countless infidels having been sent to Hell in
that extensive territory, another great multitude of them was con-
signed to the angels of torture to be put in ' chains and shackles’ and
brought to the review. At the head of the chain was the accursed
Kapak, a hound from amongst the hounds of Hell. He had been
captured among the amirs of Jar Tai Bu’s fumdan and testified with
him to the fact that the people of the north had resorted to flight. All
the other (Mughals) were either despatched to the pit of Hell or else
put in the same chains with those destined for that place. The
virtuous Malik? moved back with his troops to the Court of the
august Emperor (May his kingdom last for ever!). Time after time
he kept on sending fresh news to the Lord’s deputy,4 and was in reply
favoured with a robe of honour. Finally he reached the Imperial
Court, and brought the hellish crew to the muster of the Judgment

Day. ‘When the earth is shaken with her (violent) shaking,’ cried
the huge elephants as they threw most of these cotton wearers (i.e.
Mughals) high up in the air; and (the cotton wearers) became like ' loosened
wool. 1 But as even the enormous elephants, who are like strong
houses on moving pillars, were not able to destroy all the desolators of
this country, order was given that the base of the towers of the Fort
(Aangar-i-hisar) was to be constructed from the blood and bones of the
remaining (Mughals). Immediately in obedience to the Imperial
command, Zatars and Chinese were hung from the Fort as negroes*
with heads inverted hang down trom a new building. 3 Qwing to
the mixture of the Mughal bodies with the material of the towers,
the confluence of Mars and Saturn was witnessed, and the evil
influence of the confluence fell on the lives of these men of Mars.
For even after all the towers had been constructed, many of these
doomed men were left. Their wretched heads were cut off with
shining swords and a bastion, so high that it touched the head of the
sky, was formed of them. Mars hung its head (in shame) at the
sight. Zhe constellations of the sky have but a single ‘head,’ but here you

NOTE ON THE INVASIONS OF KAPAK IQBAL AND TAI BU.

Later historians have so confused the account of these generals that I have, for
the sake of clearness, reserved their discussion for a separate note.

As to the other authorities, Amir Khusrau has devoted some lines of his Dawal
Adni to the same campaigns. ‘After this (defeat of ‘Ali Beg and Tartaq) three
fierce (Mughal) generals, who moved more rapidly than the wind, crossed the
territory of Multan and began to ravage the land of the Ravi. One of them was
Tai Bu, the other was Iqbal Mudbir and the third was Kapak, wise in war and re-
venge. ‘Their armies, innumerable as grains of sand (had come) to take revenge
for the fate of Tartiiq and ‘Ali Beg. According to his custom, the Emperor ordered
the Minister of the State, Kaftir (camphor), to disperse the stench of Tai Bu, so
that no trace of it may remain. The great warrior marched rapidly, and crossing
two stages in one night, came upon the Mughals like a storm and dispersed their
wretched ranks. The blood of the Tatars rose high up to the breast of the horses
in thatextensivedesert. The infidel dogs fled in panic; the holy warriors pursued

? Or, in the alternative, ‘Zangis,’ a Turkish tribe. Khusrau calls the
Mongols by various names—Tatars, Turks, Chinese and Mughals. This isnot
really inaccurate, for they are all sections of the same Mongolian race and the-
Mongols freely enlisted their kindred tribes in their armies. The Mongols, who
have given their name to the whole race, seem to have been a minor tribe in the
days before Chengiz Khan, The fort referred to is the Hazar Sutun Palace or
Koshak-i Siri, 3 Allusions to stars.

them like lions. Iqb&l and Tai Bi fled from the battle-field toward the rivers,
Though they had collected spoils before this, now the preservation of their own
heads was all they wished for. The Army of Faith advanced like a riyer and
Kapak was drowned ; it pounced like a falcon and carried off Kapak as if he was
apartridge. A collar was placed round the neck of the great hound and he was
sent to the Emperorofthe World.’ Inspite ofthe mixed metaphors, these lines
will leave on the reader the impression that Iqbal, Tai Bi, and Kapak were three
generals taking part in the same campaign, though, of course, each commanded
a different army.

Barni’s account is loose and inaccurate.

‘ Qn another occasion, in another year, the army of Islim came to a battle with
the accursed Kank and the Mughal troops at Khakar, God granted victory to
Muslim arms. The accursed Kank, leader of the Mughal army, was brought cap-
tive and alive before the Sult&n’s throne, and there cast under the feet of
elephants, On this occasion also, either inthe field of battle or else atter being
brought to Delhi, enormous numbers of Mughals were slain, A tower of their
heads was raised before the Badaun Gate ; people seeit till to-day and it reminds
them of, ‘Alauddin.

‘On another occasion, in another year, three or four Mughal amirs of tumans
broke into the Siwaliks suddenly and heedlessly with thirty or forty thousand horse
and engaged in plunder and slaughter. ‘Alauddin sent the army of Isl4m against
them with orders to seize the road by which the Mughals were to return to the
river ; when the Mughals returned thirsty to the water-side, it was to mete out
their punishmenttothem. The Muslim army seized the passages of the Mughal
retreat and encamped by theriver-side. As God had ordained, having laid waste
the Siwaliks and travelling a fong distance thence, the Mughals and their
horses reached the river thirsty and in disorder. The Muslim army, which had
been waiting for their return for a few days, obtained the desired supremacy over
them. The Mughals, taken by surprise, begged for water from the Muslim army.
They were all taken captive along with their women and children. A great
victory had crowned the Muslim arms. Thousands of Mughals were sent to the fort
of Narainiya with ropes round their necks; their women and children were
brought to the Delhi slave-market and sold away like Hindustani slaves. The
Malik Khas-i-Hajib was sent to Naradniya from the capital. He went there and put
unhesitatingly to the sword alithe Mughals who had been brought to the fort
after the victory. Streams ran with their foul blood.

‘In another year Iqbalmandah came with the Mughal army. Sultan ‘Alauddin
sent the army of Islim from Delhi against them. This year also the Muslim army
gained a victory over the Mughals. After a feebly fought battle, Iqbalmanda was
slain and thousands of Mughals were put to the sword. The 4azara and sada
amirs, who had been canght alive, were brought to Delhi and cast under the feet of
elephants. On the occasion when [qbalmanda was slain, no Mughal escaped alive.’

Two later historians deserve citation.

‘ In the year A.H. 705,’ says Ferishta, ‘one of the great amirs of Dawa Khao,
named Kank, came with a large army to seek revenge for a ‘Ali Beg and Khwaja
Taryal. He had passed the precincts of Multan and reached the Siwaliks, whea
Ghazi Malik Tughlaq prepared his army for battle and seized the banks of the
river Nilab, thus cutting off the Mughal retreat. The Mughals plundered and
ravaged ; then after a long journey, when the air was hottest, they came back
to the banks of the Nilab with inflamed livers and parched. lips, ignorant of the
snare of their enemy. But when they saw the river of life in the enemy’s
hands, they naturally despaired of their lives and gave battle to the army of
Hindustan. Most of the Mughals were slain; Kank was captured alive while

those who escaped from the battle-field died of thirst in the forest, ‘Their women
and children were taken prisoners. This was a strange event, for out of fifty or
sixty thousand Mughals not more than three or four thousand were left alive.
Ghazi Malik, who became very famous on account of this victory, sent Kank with
a large number of Mughal prisoners to the Sultan. ‘Alauddio had Kank and his
comrades thrown under the elephants’ feet near the Hazar Sutun Palace, and then
constructed a tower of Mughal heads in the plain before the Badaitin Gate. It is
said that traces of it remain till tu-day. This year the Mughal women and
children were sold in Delhi and the rest of Hindustan Nike Hindi prisoners
of war.

‘A long while after this a Mughal, named Iqbilmand, came to Hindustan with
an immense army and wrought much damage. But Ghazi Malik Tughlaq marched
against Iqbalmand and after slaying him sent many live Mughals to Delhi to be
trodden down by the enormous elephants, Fear and terror now overtook the
Muchals ; the desire of coming to Hindustia was washed off from their breasts ;
and they created no trouble till the end of Sultin Qutbuddin’s reign, Ghazi Malik
Tuchlaq was stationed at Depalpir. Every year he led expeditions to Kabul,
Ghaznin, Qandhar and Garmsir, plundered and ravaged those regions and levied
tribute from their inhabitants. The Mughals had not the courage tocome and
defend their own frontiers against him.’

Nizimuddin’s account is based on Barni.

‘Next time a Mughal, named Kabik, came with a large army and fought a
battle with the army of Delhiat Khaktir. Most of the Mughals were slain and‘a
tower of their heads was constructed near the Baditiin Gate.

‘After a whilea Mughal army of thirty thousand horse came to the Siwaliks
and began to plunder. When the Sult&n heard of it, he sent a large army against
them. The army of Delhi seized the banks of the Ravi, across which the Mughals
had to return ; and when the Mughals, loaded with spoils, came to the river-side,
the army of Delhi advanced and defeated them. Many Muyhal officers were cap-
tured and imprisoned in the fort of Tarainah, which is situated in that neigh-
bourhood, while their families and followers were brought to the City and sold as
slaves, After this the Malik Khas-i Hajib was ordered to go to Tarfinah to put
the prisoners to death.

‘A long time after this Iqbatmandah, a famous Mughal, came to India witha
largearmy. An engagement took place between him and the army of Delhi at
Daradahindah Amir ‘Ali (?). Iqbalmandah was slain and the other Mughals
were brought to Delhi, where they were thrown under the feet of elephants.’

Of the five accounts before us, Nizimuddin merely summarizes Barni and need
not be further considered. The only addition he makes is the identification of the
river mentioned by Barni with the Ravi, Ferishta apparently had only Niza-
muddin and Dawal Rani before him, and plays havoc with facts and names. Of
the three original authorities 7a@7£4-2-Firozt, Dawal Rani and Khazainul Futith
the last two are fairly consistent, but itis difficult to reconcile them with the
Yari-Khi Firozt, Amir Khusrau speaks of the three generals as if they had
planned a joint push, Kapak leading the advanced contingents while the other
two marched behind. Malik Kafur (not Ghazi Malik as in Ferishta) was the com-
mander of the Delhiarmy. Barni speaks of three campaigns in three different, if
not successive, years. ‘The first is led by Kapak, the name of the commander of
the second is not given, while the third is assigned to Iqbalmandah. 1 am inclined
.to agree with Amir Khusrau, who wrote during ‘AlAuddin’s reign while Barni’s
paragraphs may not have been written till years after. Military matters .did not

interest Barni, his geographical knowledge was meagre and his’ dates a are often
incorrect.

CHAPTER IV

GusRaT, RAJPUTANA, MALWA AND DEOGIR

Having described the dagger thrusts tn many victories over the
Mughals, I now come to the conquest of the Hindis of Gujrat:—1 As the
sword of the Emperor of land and sea had been plentifully smeared
with the blood of the infidel’ Mughals, he wished to wash off this
clotted impurity in the immense ocean. Consequently, on Wednes-
day, the 20th Jamadiul Awwal, 699 a.u., a fortunate day, he issueda
firman to the ‘Ariz-7 Wala® to send an army, like clouds and rain, to
the coast of Gujrat to destroy the temple of Somnath. Like an angel
directing the clouds, the late Ulugh Khan (May God make him drink
out of the fountain of His forgiveness!) was appointed to lead the
victorious army. Resolved to conquer, the clouds moved towards
the sea ; and as the foundations of the temple were water-deep, they
wished to bring its summit to the water also. When the Imperial army
reached the City of that land,? the sword of the righteous monarch
completely conquered the province, which, adorned like a bride, had
escaped so many emperors of the past. Much blood was shed. A
general invitation was issued to all the beasts and birds of the forest
to a continuous feast of meat and drink. Jz the marriage banquet, at
which the Hindis were sacrificed, animals of all kinds ate them to their
satistaction. Then the Khan-t ‘Azam * moved his army towards the
sea.s Round the temple of Somnath, which is the centre of Hinda
worship, he drew a circle with his troops, and planted his hataz
spear so high towards the centre that its sharp point almost
pierced the sky. The banner of Islam was elevated to the equator,
while every arch emerging from the two semi-circles, into which the
army was divided, without fail passed its arrow through the black
dot of infidelity. So the temple of Somnath was made to bow
towards the Holy Mecca; and as the temple lowered its head and
jumped into the sea, you may say that the building first said its

prayers andthen had a bath. The idols, who had fixed their abode
midway to the House of Abraham (Mecca), and there waylaid
stragglers, were broken to pieces in pursuance of, Abraham’s
tradition.2 But one idol, the greatest of them all, was sent by the
maliks to the Imperial Court, so that the breaking of their helpless
god may be demonstrated to the idol-worshipping Hindts. It
seemed as if the tongue of the Imperial sword explained the meaning
of the text: ‘So he (Abraham) broke them (the idols) into pieces
except the chief of them, that haply they may return to it.’ Such a
pagan country, the Mecca of the infidels, now became the Medina
of Islam. The followers of Abraham now acted as etiides in
place of the Brahman leaders. The robust-hearted true believers
rigorously broke all idols and temples wherever they found them.
Owing to the war, ‘takbir, and‘ shahadat' was heard on every side s
even the idols by their breaking affirmed the existence of God, In
this ancient land of infidelity the call to prayers rose so high
that it was heard in Baghdad and Madain (Ctesiphon) while the ‘Ajai
proclamation (A/ufba) resounded in the dome of Abraham and over
the water of Zamzam.* As to the city of Nabrwala and the city of
Kambayat (Cambay), which the sea raises its head to swallow up, as
well as the other cities situated on the coast—though the sea beats
against them with force, yet the wave of the Muslim army did not turn
to the sea to wash off thecontamination of infidelity from the Jand, bitt
cleansed the ground by a deluge of infidel blood; for if blood is not
clean, and cannot cleanse, yet the sword is a purifier; and the sword
having overcome the infidels, their blood became pure also. My
object in this simile is not real blood, but (only to show) that dhe sword
of Islam purified the land as the sun purifies the carth§

it had been rebuilt.

in a single campaign Rantambhor was conquered, and by the decree of

conquered. They also sent to Delhi an idol, which the Brahmans had called
Somnith after the destruction of Nath by Sultan Mahmiid, for the people to tread
on. Nusrat Khan then proceeded to Cambay and took plenty of precious stones and
valuables from the Khwajas (Muslim merchants) of Cambay, who were very rich.
Kafir Hazardinari, who later on became the Afalié Naib and infatuated ‘Alauddin,
was forcibly seized from his Khwaja and brought to the Sultan.’ (arnz).

While the.army was returning from Gujrat, a serious mutiny broke out, which
Khusrau refrains from mentioning. Itis, however, described by Barni. ‘When
Ulugh Khan and Nusrat Khaa were returning from Gujrat with their spoils,’ he
continues, ‘ they resorted to great severity and to kicks and blows to find out
what spoils had fallen into the hands of the men and in demanding the fifth part,
which was the share of the state. Their demands were extortionate; they would
not accept the returns made by the men but wanted more. By compelling the
men to drink salt water, and by vafiots kinds of coercion, they wished to take
away from them all the gold, silver, jewels and other valuables they had. These
tortures drove the men to desperation. There were a number of ‘ New Muslim’
Amirs and horsemen in the army who collected together, about two or three
thousand in number, and raised a revolt. They killed Nusrat Khan’s brother,
Malik Aizzuddin, who was the Amir-t-hajié of Ulugh Khan and then proceeded
tumultuously to Ulngh Khan’s tent. Ulugh Khan cleverly came out of his tent
unrecognized and escaped to Nusrat Khan’s tent. A nephew (sister’s son) of
Sultan ‘Alatiddin was sleeping in Ulugh Khan’s tent and the mutineers slew him
under the impression that he was Ulugh Khan, The disturbance spread through
the whole army and there was a grave danger that the spoils (of Gujrat) would
be lost. But as ‘Alauddin’s power was destined to increase, even such a
disturbance was soon quelled. The horse and foot of the army gathered before

Nusrat Khan’s tent, the ‘New Muslim’ Amirs and horsemen were dispersed,
and their ringleaders, who had instigated the revolt, fied for refuge to the ra#s
and other rebellious (chiefs). Further inquiry into the spoils was given up, and
Nusrat Khan and Ulugh Khan reached Delhi with the spoils, treasures, elephants
and slaves they had obtained in the plunder of Gujrat.

‘ When news of the '*‘ New Muslim ’’ revolt reached Delhi, Sultan ‘Alduddin,
from the cruelty that was ingrained ia his nature, ordered the wives and children
of all the rebels, high and low, to be captured and imprisoned. Now was begun
the practice of punishing women aud children for the misdeeds of men, which
had not till then been known in Delhi. But a more horrid act of tyranny was
committed by Nusrat Khan, the author of many acts of violence in the City. In
revenge for his brother’s death, he dishonoured and disgraced the wives of those
who had struck his brother with their axes; he gave them to sweepers to be used
as prostitutes and ordered their suckling children to be broken to pieces on their
heads. His actions filled people with horror and dismay. A shiver went through
the hearts of men.’

A short sketch of the conquest is also found in the Dawal Rani. ' When
the territory of Sind, the motntains and the sea, had become obedient to him,
the Sultan's exalted judgment decided that the Rai of Gujrat shotild also come
within his power. He sent Ulugh Khan to scatter the dust of that province to the
winds and to defeat the Ral with his superior wisdom. Like lions (the Mussal-
mans) shed the blood of the gaérs by the side of the river and the sea; and the
temple of Somnath was overthrown with so much force that the earth trembled
like the ocean.’ (Dawal Rani).

Providence the land of intidelity became the land of Islam. ‘' When the
celestial canopy of the Shadow of God cast its shade over the hill of
Rantambhor and the conqueror of the world emitted his heat like
the stm over the unlucky inhabitants of that place, the days of their
life began to decline. The towering fort, which talked with the stars
through its lofty pinnacles, was surrounded by the troops. The
Saturnian Hindiis, who are related to that planet, had for purposes of

The fortunes (or misfortunes) of Rai Karan’s wife, Kamala Devi and his
daughter, Dival Devi, are deseribed by Amir Khusrau in his Dawal Rani and are
summarized in prose by Ferishta. The story is too long for citation in a foot-note.
(See my monograph on Amir Khusrau, chapter ii, Messrs. Taraporevala, Bombay).

To Khusrau’s regard for the memory of Sultan Jalaluddin and his reluctance
to refer to anything not morally creditable to ‘Alauddin, we may attribute his
omission of the conquest of Multan by Ulugh Khan and Zafar Khan. Arkali
Khan, the eldest son of Sultan Jalaluddin, was governor of Multan when his
father was assassinated at Karra. Sultan Jalaluddin’s wife, the Malka-i Jahan,
instead of calling Arkali Khan, hastened to place her youngest son, Ruknuddin
Ibrahim, on the throne. Her action was probably due to the expectation that
she would be all in all] with a minor on the throne, whereas Arkali Khan had a
will of his own, But when ‘Alfuddin advanced towards Delhi, the Malka-i
Jahan found herself too weak to make a stand and most of her officers deserted
to the enemy. She frantically appealed to Arkali Khan, but he had been deeply
wounded by his mother’s behaviour and refused tostir. Finally when ‘Alauddin
encamped opposite to Delhi, the Malka-i Jahan and Sultan Ruknuddin fled to
Multan. ‘The first project, which ‘Alauddin entertained after his accession to
the throne, was the removal of the late Sultan’s sous. Ulugh Khan and Zafar
Khan were sent to Multan with many AZalits and Amirs and an army of thirty or’
forty thousand horse. After they had besieged Mult&n for a month or two, the
Kotwal and the citizens of Multan turned away from Sultan Jalaluddin’s sons and
some of their Aszrs joined the besiegers. Jalaluddin’s sons asked for peace
through the mediation of Shaikhul Islam Shaikh Ruknuddin; after it had
been promised and the terms settled, they came out (of the city) with the
Shaikhul Isl4m and all their #7alzks and Amirs. Ulugh Khan treated them with
honour and quartered them near his own tent. He sent a message of victory to
Delhi, where it was read from the pulpits and then despatched to the provinces.
Qubbaks (cupolas) were constructed in the City and drums beaten in joy.
‘Alduddin’s power over Hindiistan was now established and he had no enemy or
rival to fear.’

‘Ulugh Khan and Zafar Khan, who had the sons of Sultan Jalaluddin (both
of whom had once possessed the canopy) together with all their Afalzés and Amirs
in their hands, now started for Delhi. On the way they met Nusrat Khan,
who had been sent to them. The two sons of Sultan Jalaluddin Ulughu, a
son-in-law of the late Sultan, and Malik Ahmad Chap, the ex-Naid-2 Amiri
ffajib, were all blinded. Their Aarems were separated from them and their
wealth, goods, slaves and slave-girls, in fact, all they possessed, were seized by
Nusrat Khan, who imprisoned the sons of Sultan Jalaluddin in the fort of Hansi
and put the sons of Arkali to death. He brought their Aarems, together with the
Malka-i Jahan and Ahmad Chap to Delhi and kept them as prisoners in his own
house.’ (Barni, Persian Text, pp. 249-50).

defence collected fire in all the ten towers, thus /urning the lowers of
earth (burj-i khakt)) into towers of fire, Every day the fire of those
people of Hell extended its heated tongue to the light of Islim. But
as the Mussalmiins, men of pure elements, had no means of extinguish-
ing it, they took care of their own water (morale) without trying to
overcome the fire. Sand-bags were sewn and with them a pashid was
constructed. From the sowing of sand-bags it seemed that the
Emperor of the world was investing the sand even witha robe of honour
in reward for its capturing the fort. What then was to be the reward
of men? JIfay the country prosper under such an Emperor till water and
earth, fire and air continue to exist! * When the pashi6 rose high
enough to touch the western tower of the fort, the Imperial West-
erners (aghrabis) appeared like the trunk of an elephant on its summit
and shot large earthen balls. A mountain moved against the infidel
fort, and the hearts of the Hindiis began to fail them.

3 Some ‘New Muslims’ from among the ill-starred Mughals had
turned their faces from the sun of Is]l4m and joined the Saturnians.4
All these men of Mars had collected together in the tower of fire
(durj-7 atshin); but though they had lighted a fire in all the three towers,
and gathered like particles in the ‘ heaven full of stars’, yet was Mer-
cury (#27 or arrow) caught in the sign of Saggittarius (gaws), and wander-
ing towards the fire, was totally consumed. From*® Rajab to Zil
Q'ad the victorious army remained encamped at the foot of the fort.
From the towers above, the fire rose high enuugh to evaporate the
water-laden canopy of the clouds, but the fortunate Mussalmans
gathered together every day at the extremity of the pasked and carried
forward the Imperial banner. With the impetuosity of Bahram

* A number of ‘ New Muslims’, ie. Monogols converted to Islam, had rebel-
led when the army of Delhi was returning from Gujrat and sought refuge at
Rantambhor. They were among its staunchest defenders.

5 Tne following appears to be the sense of the sentences of which a literal
translation is given above. ‘When ‘Alauddin began to pile up his sand-bags
on the western side of the fort, the martial Hindiis (who though Saturnians were
the Meu of Mars as well) and their ‘‘ New Muslim ’’ comrades collected together in
the three western towers of the fort, which looked like ‘* the heaven full of stars ’’.
From here they threw fire on the besiegers who were constructing a paskeb at
the foot of the fort and at the same time shot their arrows (Mercury) also. But
the arrows they shot (so Amir Khusrau 1mayines) wandered into the fire they had
thrown and were consequently burnt. -

the brave warriors penetrated like salamanders through a fire that
scared away the lion of the sky (the sun). To the sound of pipes, the
patko (footmen) from above made their arrows dance over the fire so
that even birds could not fly over the ethereal sphere; the royal falcons
were, therefore, unable to reach the dome of fire which extended to
the sky. 1 Again, the ‘fradas inside the fort, being the brides of the
Hindiis, had borne them female offsprings of stone and were openly
throwing them out by the end of Sha'’ban, The Imperial ghazbans took
account of their misdeeds and stoned them. For tnevttably the mischievous
ts stoned, ‘The stones of the besieging maghrabis went up in the air and
struck the clouds with such force that lightning was emitted from them.
Heavy stones fell like hail on the heads of the besieged; they ate
them and became cold, Yes! Their provisions being finished, they
ate stones. Famine prevailed to such an extent within the fort, that
they would have purchased a grain of rice for two grains of gold but could
not get it. The fire of hunger had roasted their hearts within their
earthen bosoms—ard they wished to open their bosoms and cat up their
roasted hearts. Man can bear all afflictions except that of a starving
stomach,

2 When the celestial sun had ascended the steps of honour and sat
in the sign of Aries to hold the festival of the New Year’s Day (aurfiz),
tankas of gold were showered on the earth like falling leaves, and it
became finer than a garden. After the xauriz, the Sun of Justice (the
Sultan) shone full on the Rantambhor hill and every day its heat and
light increased,? till finally the lofty fort, which drew its water-
supply from the azure sky, became a desert from lack of vegetation
and water. The world seemed smaller to the Rai (of Rantambhor)
than the prison within a rose-bud, So in his desperation one night he
lighted a high fire, which rose like a mountain-tulip on the hill, and
threw into it the rosy-coloured young maidens, who had grown up in

his arms. After he had personally despatched to hell these deserving
inmates of paradise, he came to the head of the Jashz6 with one or two
other unbelievers, bent on sacrificing his life with honour. Though the
morning breeze had begun to blow, the narcissus-eyes of the watch-
men had not yet closed in sleep. The melody of the bulbul accompanied
the Maz as he advanced. The rose raised a cry. The watchmen
drew their swords of lily, sprang up from their places like the morning
breeze and put the Raz to flight, as the winter-wind annihilates the
blooming cypress. Thus on the fortunate date, Tuesday, the 3rd Zz/
Qa'd, 700 ava. such an impregnable fort was taken through an
exercise of the strong will. 1 The title of the ‘ Place of Islam’ was sent
from heaven for this house of infidelity. The inhabited parts of Jhabun,
that old land of paganism, became the ‘ New City ’ of the true believers.
The great Imperial banner stood over the iron fort like a key in a lock;
for it was the key for the conquest of southern lands. First the temple
of Bahir Deo, the support of which he had invoked, was destroyed,
Then the houses of infidelity were overthrown by the strong arm of
the holy warriors, Many strongly built temples, which the trumpet of
the Day of Judgment could not have shaken, went to sleep on the
ground as the morning breeze of Islam blew upon them, The stones
of the infidel fort had grown deaf from hearing the Hindi conches;
but now they re-echoed the (Muslim) call for prayer, Where
formerly the loud pealing of the Brahman’s kettles had torn the ears
of the Hindts, now the sound of the Prophet’s A‘dztba filled true
. believing ears with a melodious joy. Aenceforward whichever side
the Imperial armies march, I know their arrow will hit the mark ; wherever
the Imperial ' Khutha’ is read, ils fame will resound to the sky?

2¢Next the Sultan planned another expedition to win elephants and
treasures, Ulugh Khia went to Jhain and moved towards the fort of Rantambhor.
The army invested the fort as the sea invests the land. The Emperor also went
after him and the august pavilion was pitched up on the hill. The fort itself was
as high and exalted as the family of the Rai, Hamir Deo, who, though a descendant
of Rai Pithaura, exceeded his ancestor in pride. He had rdis, rdwats, rauas
and an army beyond computation; there were well caparisoned elephants,
thousands of horses swift as the wind aud footmen without limit. The fort of
Rantambhor, which is two weeks’ march from Delhi, was encircled by a wall
three farsangs in length. The Sultan attacked the fort as ‘Ali had attacked
Khaibar. The maghraéis began to strike the fort from east and west with such
force that at every stroke-one of the towers threw its hat on the ground;
because the stomes were sent by the Emperor, the fort kissed the ground as

of Malwa:— When the lancers of the victorious army had put
antimony into the eyes of the more dimsighted azs with their
spears, many powerful Zamindars, gifted with greater keenness of

soon as they touched it. The Sultan was firm in his determination and reduced
the fort in a month or two. As the fort was struck by stone after stone in
succession, the path which had been attempted for thirty years was cleared, and
through the pious resolve of the Sultan, the desire of an age was fulfilled in a
month. When this ‘' land of infidelity ’? became the ‘‘ land of Islam,” the Sultan
assigned the palace and the fort of Rantambhor to Ulugh Khan while he himself
returned to the capital.’ (Dawal Rani). There are three mistakes in this short
description: the time was considerably longer than is asserted, the fort was
reduced not by saghrabi strokes but through the arduous process of the pashi6,
and the affair was anything but the easy walk-over a reader of Amir Khusrau
would imagine.

Barni’s description gives an idea of the difficulties that faced ‘Alduddin at
Rantambhor : ‘ The first expedition of the Sultan was against Rantambhor, which
was (comparatively) nearer to Delhi and had been seized by Hamir Deo,
grandson of Rai Pithaura of Delhi, Ulugh Khan, who held the territory of Biana,
was sent against the fort and Nusrat Khan, who was governor of Karra
that year, was ordered to march to his assistance with the army of Karra and the
other provinces of Hindiistan, Ulugh Khan and Nusrat Khan captured Jhain and
laid siege to Rantambhor. But one day Nusrat Khao, who had gone too near the
fort in order to direct the construction of the pas#76 and the raising of the gargayj,
was struck by a stone shot from a maghvabi in the fort and died after two or
three days. When the news was brought to ‘Alauddin, he came out of the city
in royal splendour and started for Rantambhor. (At Tilpat, however, ‘Alauddin’s
nephew, Akat Khan, tried to assassinate him and the plot just missed success.)
After this event the Sultan marched by continuous stages to Rantambhor and
fixed hiscamp there. The siege, which had been commenced before his arrival,
was now pushed on with greater vigour. Ropes were brought from every side
and woven into sacks, which were distributed to the army, to be filled with earth
and thrown into the ditch. The fask2j was constructed and the garga7 was
raised. The besieged destroyed the pash7 with their maghrabz-stones and threw
fire from their ramparts, while the besiegers established themselves over the
territory of Jhain till Dhar. (At this juncture the Sultan’s nephews ‘Umar and
Mangii revolted at Badatin and Oudh while a freedman, Haji Maula, raised a
rebellion in Delhi.) News of the tumult and disturbance at Delhi was brought to
‘Alauddin but he had made a princely resolve to conquer Rantambhor and
refused to stir from his place. The large army investing the fort was weary and
sick of the siege—it was mid-summer—but from fear of ‘Alauddin’s punishment
no horse or foot could either return from the army to Delhi or desert
it and fly away to some other place. Repeated rebellions had aroused
‘Alauddin from his sleep and he strove hard to reduce the fort. After much
bloodshed and a hard struggle, Rantambhor was at last captured, and Hamir Deo
and the '' New Muslims ’’, who had fled to him after the Gujrat rebellion, were put
to death. The Sultan assigned Rantambhor and its territory to Ulugh Khan and
returned to Delhi.’ (Zériéh-i Firozi).

vision, threw aside their boldness and impudence from fear of the
stone-piercing arrows of the Turks. They came to the Imperial Court
with open eyes and turned its threshold into antimony by rubbing their
black pupils upon it; at the same time they saved their bones from
becoming antimony-boxes for the dust.1. The Emperor regarded
every one of them with an affectionate glance, and threw on them a
ray of his favour, which their eyes had never expected to behold.
Finally, no impudent infidel remained in the provinces of Hind; some
had gone to sleep on the scarlet-coloured bed of (Imperial) punish-
ment; others had opened their eyes and bowed in obedience before
the Court,

But on the southern frontier, Rai Mahlik Deo of Malwa and Kika
Pardhan had a permanent army of thirty or forty thousand chosen
horsemen. The darkness of their (minds) and the dust raised by their
legions had put the antimony of pride in their eyes. ‘When Fate
decrees, the sight is blinded’. A curtain had fallen before their eyes
and they forsook the path of loyalty. Consequently, a body of select
troops was sent by the Emperor against them and fell on those blind
wanderers all of asudden. Victory itself preceded them and had her
eyes fixed upon the road to see when the triumphant army would
arrive. When the army of Isiam came upon the rebels, their eyes

Hamir Deo came out of the fort with two hundred thousand horse and foot and
offered battle.’ Ulugh Khan raised the siege and withdrew to Jhain, from where
he wrote of the state of affairs to the Emperor. After the siege had dragged on
for one year—or, according to another statement, for three years—the Emperor
collected a large army from all sides and distributed bags to them. Every man
filled his bag with sand and threw it into the ditch, called ‘ran,’ till an ascent to
the wall being formed, the besieged were overpowered and the fort captured. Hamir
Deo fell along with his tribe. Most of the rebels, led by Mohammad Shah, who
had fled to Rantambhor from Jalore, fell in the siege. Mir Mohammad Shah
himself was lying wounded. When the Sultdn’s eye fell on him, he asked him
outof kindness: ‘If I have your wounds attended to and rescue you from this
dangerous condition, how will you behave towards me in future?’ ‘If l regain my
health,’ the other replied, ‘I will put you to death and raise the son of Hamir
Deo to the throne.’ Stung to fury, the Sultan ordered him to be cast under the
elephant’s feet, but soon after, remembering Mohammad Shah’s courage and
loyalty, be ordered the dead man to be decently buried, Further, ‘AlAuddin put
to death those who bad deserted the aforesaid RAja—the Raja's wazir Ranmal,
etc. ‘Such has been their behaviour towards their own master,’ he said. ‘ How
can they be loyal to me?’

were closed and their necks were cut open with the blows of the sword.
Streams of blood sank into the ground, So far as the human eye
could see, the ground was muddy with blood. The Hindits tried to fly
away from the blood-eating earth, yet with eyes full of tears many of
them sank in the mire. At this moment Kaka came blindly forward,
but his horse remained stuck in the mud ‘ like black earth in the mire’.
In the twinkling of an eye he was pierced by innumerable arrows, and
Jooked like a bee-hive with a thousand compartments, all full of bees.
Then his soul fled to the streams of the under-world, while his
unfortunate head was sent to the Imperial Court, so that it may attain
to a real sublimity by being placed under the feet of the royal horses
below the Palace Gate.

When Malwa, an extensive territory of which even clearsighted
geographers are unable to discover the limits, was conquered, it was
necessary to entrust it to an experienced and clever governor
(mutasarrif), who would not only keep a firm hand over the newly
conquered land, but also through courageous judgment and great
efforts reduce the fort of Mandi, an edifice so high that the human eye
was unable to see its summit. The Emperor surveyed with a critical
eye the confidential and trusty servants of the state to see which of
them most deserved being entrusted with such a post. When his
inspired mind had come to a conclusion, he mentioned to the
Hfajib-t-Khas with his brow: ‘Tell ‘Ainul Mulk? (the Eye of the
State) that I have seen foresight in him. I am giving him the title of
‘Ainul Mulk and elevating him to a very high office. I entrust him
with the province of Malwa, where the darkness of infidelity has been
illuminated with the light of Islam. He is to use his foresight with
skill, without permitting his eyelid to cover his pupils in sleep at the
command of night. A handful of thorns stil] remain in that land, and
he is not to consider his eyes safe from being pricked by those ignoble
people. He has to conquer the fort of Mandi by closing up the
streams and making breaches in the walls; and when, by the kindness
of the ‘‘Opener of the Gates ‘’, the place has been conquered, he has to
wash away, with the sharpness of his sword, the contamination of

naturally suggested by the title of ‘AInul Mulk Multani (the eye of the state),

infidelity, which sticks to that pagan land as evil intentions stick to the
eyes of the rebellious. The cowardly Mahlik Deo has withdrawn to his
fort as the eye of a blind man sinks into its socket. Bring him out
by such means as you can in order to overawe the other Hindtis. And
if, even fora short time, he remains safe in his fort from the arrows
of the Mussalmiins, you are to expect nothing but anger from me,
There ts reproot for him tt he is unable to flow streams of blood on the
mountains. The 'Hajib-khas’ came and in his official way told ‘Ainul
Mulk exactly what the Imperial order was. ‘Ainul Mulk stood up
as the eyelashes stand upon the eyelids, rubbed his forehead on the
ground and accepted the royal fran with the pupils of his eyes.
‘Atnul Mulk started on the mission with his troops and opened wide
his joyous eyes to accomplish the task entrusted to him by the
Emperor. He cleared the territory (Malwa) of the remaining evil
doers as the eye is cured of its inflammation, till finally his sword
refused to do any further work and went into the ‘eye’ of its
scabbard. The dark-faced Rai, like a grain of chaksi,) had sought
shelter between two stones; but he only made it clear that he would
be pealed and ground for the sake of ‘Ainul Mulk (the Eye of the
State). From dimness of sight, the Rat sent the ‘light of his eyes ’2
in front, thus making him a shield for his own eyes. At the same
time he placed round his son an enormous multitude which only
contributed to his fall, as overgrown eyelashes injure the eyes. All at
once a body of ‘Ainul Mulk’s troops fell upon them, like the dust storm
that overpowers the eyes of men. Inan instant the boldest of them
were rolling in blood and dust, while the Rai’s son slept the sleep of
death. But ‘Ainul Mulk’s clear judgment was not content with this
success and he wished to lure the Rat himself out of his cave. He
was planning this when a spy (didbar) came back from the fort and
undertook to guide them. The man Ied them by a way he had
discovered, illuminating the path with the lamp of his eyes. In the
course of the night ‘Ainul Muik’s army reached the summit and fell on
Mahlik Deo with the impetuosity of a shooting-star before even his

household gods were aware of it. Then eye-piercing arrows began to
pour on them like innumerable drops of rain, while the flashes of the
sword dazzled their eyes. The meteoric arrows kindled a fire in the
bodies of these demons (deos)' brought up in the shade. Rai Mahlik
Deo (the fierce demon) was burnt from head to foot in his battle with
the shooting-stars and fled to the stream of Sfir, where he was slain.
This event occurred on Thursday, the 5th of Jamadiul Awwal, 705 a.u.
The gate of the fort of Mandt was opened before them like the eye of
fortune. Where, formerly, through secret magic and tricks that
deceived the sight,* the gaérs had drawn a veil over the people’s eyes
with the dark sayings of infidelity, mow true believers, under the
‘brows’ of the arches, bowed in thankfulness to the ground. The eyes
of the angels were illuminated with the light of congregational prayers
and Friday sermons. The four walls of the fort resounded at all the
five prayers to the sound of the ‘Opening Verses’: ‘(All) Praise is
due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds’, Malik ‘Alnul Mulk wrote down
ali this with the black of his pupil and sent it through his 4aj7d to the
Emperor to be placed before his august eyes. The wise king under
the shadow of his canopy is like the ‘Idea of Man’; for the ‘ Bye of
God’ is over him.2 When this good news was brought to the
Emperor, he bowed down in thankfulness and assigned the territory of
Mandt also to ‘Ainul Mulk. Alay God perfect the Empire of the Sultan
and guard his pertection with the Pertect Eye.4

There was a warlike wacir, named Kika, who had more influence in Malwa than
the Rai himself. He had forty thousand horsemen and foot beyond all
computation. But ten thousand (horsemen) sent thither from the capital
shattered Kiika’s army. The heads of the slain reached the Sult&n in quick
succession ; new flags were put on the Imperial banner. He who does not come
to pay obedience to the Emperor on his ‘' feet’’, is compelled to come on his
‘head 7? ! Away from Mahlik Deo, who had remained on his mountain, the Hindis
were slain and captured in large numbers. But as the Sultén had determined
that the light of Islam was to fully illuminate those parts, he motioned to ‘Ainul
Muik with his brows that he was to betake himself to Malwa with speed. With the
foresight he had, ‘Ainul Mulk obeyed the order with the pupils of his eyes, and

started for Malwa with his troops, who surrounded him as the eyelashes encircle
the eyes. Though General ‘Ainul Mulk was a man of letters, he had also a

Conqueror of the World, resolved on the conquest of Chitor, ordered
his high-sounding drums to be beaten. The crescent-banner was

good fortune of the Emperor, ‘Ainul Mulk first cut down the r@is ofthe place and
then for a time gave grass and water to his horses round the fort of Mandi.
Cutting the thorns of the ground with his dagger, he battered at the fort with iron.
But it was a strange fort, four farsangs in circumference and high enough to touch
the mirror of the sky. ‘Ainul Mulk tried to find a path, but it was hard to find
one that would lead them to the towers that rose as high asthe moon. But an
opening having been suddenly discovered, the army rushed to it from both sides of
the fort. Tbe RAI was captured and slain near the Sar, and news of the victory
was sent to the Emperor, who assigned the conquered territory to ‘Ainul Mulk.’

‘*Ainul Mulk Multani, one of the great maliks, was despatched with a large
army to conquer the territories of Malwa, Ujjain, Chanderl and Jalore. When
‘Ainul Mulk reached Malwa, Kika, the raja (?) of the place, came out to meet him
with forty thousand Rajput horse and a hundred thousand foot. A fierce battle
took place between the two armies, and ‘Ainul Mulk was victorious. Having
conquered Ujjain, Mandi, Dharanagri and Chanderi on the 10th Jamadiul Awwal,
he sent a message of victory tothe Emperor. In Delhi for seven days and nights
drums were beaten in joy, and sugar was loaded in carts and distributed to the
citizens. Katar Deo, ruler of the Jalore fort, was frightened at the conquest of
Malwa. He obtained a safe-conduct through the intermediation of ‘Ainul Mulk,
presented himself before the Emperor and was enrolled among the allies.’

instead of grass. After the wind of Imperial wrath had uprooted all
the mugaddams,? he rid the land of its two colours, and helped the
vaiyats, the cultivators of the land, among whom no thorn raises its
head, to grow. The roots and branches of this azure edifice were
assigned to the grand tree of the grand Empire, Khizr Khan and
given the name of ' Khizrabad’. The red canopy was placed over

predominated over the head of the Hindiis, was ordered to be moved
to the City of Islam, Delhi. He (the Emperor) made the killing of
all Hindiis, who were out of the pale of Islam, such an obligation on
his infidel-smiting sword (Zulfigar) that should Muslim schismatics
(rvafizgis) in these days even nominally demand their rights, the pure
Sunnis would swear in the name this rightful Caliph of God.!

tion. There, also, was a Rai with a large army, who, to speak the truth, was
the most exalted of all Hindit rulers. But the Emperor did not waste much time;
the fort was reduced in two months with such effect that Saturn became anxious
about the safety of his own constellation. It was named Khizrabad and presented
to Khizr Khan. Chitor, the paradise of the Hindiis, is a wonderful fort and has
springs and meadows on every side.’ (Dawal Rani).

‘ Sultan ‘Alauddin came out of the city with his army and marched to Chitor,
which he invested and captured in a short time and then returned to Delhi.’
(Barni).

The story set afloat by Colonel James Tod will not bear a critical examination.
The following is Ferishta’s account of the famous Padmini and the later history ~
of Chitor :-—~

‘In the meantime Ratan Sen, Raja of Chitor, had obtained his deliverance in
a most unusual way. The details of the incident are these. After the Raja had
been in jail for some time, it came to the Emperor’s ears that among the Raja’s
women (zandn) there was one, Padmini—a woman of fine stature, with dark eyes
and moon-like face, and adorned with all the accomplishments of a beauty. The
Emperor sent the Raja a message that his release would depend on his presenting
her (to the Sultan), The Raja consented and sent messengers to call his family, who
had taken refuge in inaccessible hill-tracts, so that the Emperor’s chosen may be
picked out of them. Butthe Raja’s Rajput relatives were shocked at the message.
They reproached him severely aud wished to mix a little poison in some food and
send it to him; he would take it and withdraw into the world of the dead without
becoming notorious for his dishonour. The Raja’s daughter, however, who was
famous for her intelligence among her tribe and kindred, disliked this proposal,
‘*T have thought of a plan,’’ she said, ‘' by which my father’s life will be saved and
yet his honour will not be lost. It is this. Despatch a large number of litters
full of warriors with a body of horse and foot to Delhi and at the same time
publish the news, that in obedience to the Emperor’s order, the Raja’s women are
coming tohim. On reaching the suburbs, they are to enter the city at night and
take the road to the Raja’s prison-house. On reaching there all the Rajputs are to
draw their swords, overpower anyone who stands in their way and enter the
prison; then seating my father on a swift-footed horse, they are to take the way
to their homes with speed.”” The counsellors approved of the plan and acted
upon it. A body of devoted warriors sat in the litters and came to Delhi. When
a part of the night had passed, they entered the city. ‘ We have brought
Padmini and all the relatives of the Raja,’’ they cried. On nearing the prison, the
Rajputs drew their swords, rushed out of their litters and quickly cut the guards
to pieces; then they broke the Raja’s chains, mounted him on a horse and
struggled out of the city like a bird out of its cage. Jéined, next, by a body of
Rajputs, who had been waiting for them, they took the way to theirhomes. The
Emperor’s horsemen pursued them on their journey and overtook them at several

In the second conquest of Deogir, tts Rai was captured and then set
free. ‘RAI Ram Deo was a wild horse that had once before come
within the halters of the Imperial officers and had been trained with
the horse-breaker’s whip, which disciplines a demon (deo). But then
the Imperial horsemen had, with the greatest kindness, left him the
desired meadows of his ancient Demon-land (Deo-lakh),? and like a
well-fed horse he had forgotten the neck-breakine bridle and became
headstrong and refractory. The Emperor of the celestial throne sent
the Malik Naib Bar-bek® (May God strengthen the whip of his
authority!) to capture the runaway. With him were sent thirty
thousand horse-breakers, scourge in hand, to train the haughty
horses of the rebel army. They easily accomplished a march of
three hundred farsangs without drawing their bridles and fell on that
army of horses who had turned away from their head-stalis. On
Saturday, the 19th of Ramazan, 706 a.x. the (Imperial) horsemen were
ordered to lead their horses to the charge and to moisten their
swords, which were cold as lilies, with blood from necks of
the gabrs. The rebel army fled and its scattered ranks were
torn by further differences. The Rai’s son ran away on his horse.
Most of the Hindi soldiers, sewn together by shots of arrows and
spears, fled to the regions of the wunder-world. The troops that
survived were cut into two parts by the dividing sword. One

places; many Rajputs were slain in the skirmishes, but the Raja, somehow
or other, with great difficulty reached the hills, where his family was living.
Rescued from the Emperor’s torturing claws through the fortunate plan of his
accomplished daughter, the Raja began to plunder the territory round the Chitor
Fort. ‘Alauddin, however, in accordance with the demands of political expedi-
ency, took the fort from Khizgr Khan and bestowed it,on the Raja's sister’s son, Kariz
Rai, who was in the Emperor’s service and had given many proofs of his loyalty,
In a short time Khariz Rai strengthened himself wonderfully in the place; allthe
Rajputs were pleased with his government and joined him. He remained firmly

* loyal till the Emperor’s death. Every year he came with presents from

his land to kiss the threshold of the great conqueror, and was honoured with the
gift of a horse and a special robe, after which he returned-to his home.
Whenever the Sulta@n’s army went on an expedition, he appeared obediently with
five thousand horse and ten thousand foot and exposed his life to many
dangers.’ ©

half of them in excessive fear turned away their horses from the
battle-field and fled with the R4i’s son, for their souls were flying away
from their bodies as an tunruly horse flies off from the rider’s hands,
The rest capitulated and gave up their horses to the Oandkash of the
prisoners. The Muslim horsemen being victorious, the Malik-z
Sahkash? ordered that such booty as was fit for the troopers should be
given back to them, while things only suitable for the Sublime Court
—fleet-footed horses that flew over the plain, hill-like elephants (whose
feet) wore away the rocks, treasures which surpassed all imagination
—were reviewed, recorded and then entrusted to the officers of (the
royal) horse and elephant stables and the treasury.

2 As the Emperor had ordered the ‘ tongue’ of the sword to take
as much care as possible of the Rai and his relatives in the battle-field,
the great Commander restricted his efforts to catching the refractory
Ram Deo and most of his menalive. But as their heads had wavered
from loyalty, first the yoke of Imperial authority, which is supreme
over all its rivals, was placed on their criminal necks. Yes, he put (the
yoke) so tightly that their jugular veins nearly snapped asunder. But the
New Messiah, ie., the rightly guided Sultan, knew in his forgiving
heart that fear of his punishing sword had taken out all life from their
bodies; so he blew his spirit into them and brought them to life
again. When all these people had regained their life by the blowing
of the Sultan’s ‘ breath’ (favour) upon them, the Malik Naib brought
them to the Baitul Ma'mir of Jesus (Delhi), that they may see the life-
giving holy spirit with their own eyes. And the holy spirit gave them
the good news of an eternal existence. ° As none but benevolent images
are formed in the mirror of the Second Alexander, therefore in spite of
the signs of rebellion he had seen in Rim Deo, he took the Rai under
the ramparts of his protection and forgiveness and considered the
inverted images, which appeared in the latter’s rusty iron heart, the
refraction of a worthless looking-glass. And he raised the Rai to
such a high dignity, that owing to the strength of his good fortune,
his face was never for a single moment away from the mirror on the
knees (of the Second Alexander). The R&l was indeed fortunate

when the Hindi sword of the Emperor became a breast-plate for the
protection of his honour. An order (sharf-na@ma) of Alexander also
made this clear. When avenging fate ceased to hate the rebellion of the
Hindi, the sword of the Alexander turned into a mirror before his eyes, For
full six-months the fortunate Rai remained in the rays of Imperial
favour, as the crescent bends its back in the service of the Sun; day
by day his honour'and dignity increased, till in the course of time he
attained to the orbit of his prosperity like the full moon. The Sun of
the Empire honoured him with a blue canopy, and arrayed in all
pomp, he moved to his own permanent constellation. May God
protect the Sultan, for he sustains his subjects, like the moon, with his
benevolent rays.3

Account of the conquest of Sitwina, which became Khatrabad, by the
imperial sword (May it be preserved for ever '). * When the lions of the
august threshold had subdued all surrounding animals with their
powerful strokes, so that for five hundred farvsangs from the royal
garden no tiger was left, which the lions of the Imperial army need
trouble their claws about, the Imperial horseman became tired of the
inactivity and wished to let his swift-footed horses wander at will for
a few days in the hunting-field. On Wednesday, the 11th Muharram,
710 a.x. the standards of the army were moved (out of Delhi) for the
campaign ; and fhey shook as the heart of a wild beast beats when there is a
sheep in the forest. *Itis the custom of the world-conqueror not to re-
turn from any of his flights without reducing the fort and overpowering
its possessor. He raised his wings to fly from Imperial Delhi
to Siwdna, a distance of one hundred farsangs, and besieged that fort
which was an asylum of wild robbers. Upon the hill he saw a fort so
high that the eagle could not reach its summitin ten flights. In it sat
a gabr, named Satal Deo, like the Stmurgh* on the Caucasus.
Several thousand other gadrs sat on the top of the hill, like so many
mountain-vultures, ready to have themselves torn. Like stone-eating
birds they opened their mouths and waited till the »aghrabi-stones
’ began to fly to them from every side. Then some of them fell
down like sparrows and their gizzards were broken into atoms,

while others fluttered their wings and feet and gave up.the ghost. The
men of the army threw up their hats to catch these household birds and
cut them to pieces. How long could ihe gante continue? + Towards the east
the Sun of the Barth? (May God elevate him to the constellation of the
Lion ]) sat on a throne with lion’s feet and with tiger’s eyes engraved
over it. He ordered the swordsmen of the right wing to attack the
southern side of the fort, while the lions of the left wing attacked it
from the north. The sazjanigs on the west were entrusted to Malik
Kamaluddin Gurg (the wolf); for he excelled in killing lions as much as
the wolf excels in killing sheep. The maghrabis under the command of
the ‘ wolf’? made a cave in the hill with every shot. Finally, the head
of the pash7b reached the summit of the hill. By the order of the
Emperor, the heroes of the army marched over the elephantine pashzb
and fell on the animals within the fort. Butas the besieged were brave
and haughty, they did not fly though their heads were cut into pieces,
Those who attempted to fly were chased and caught. Some were sent
to sleep like hares with strokes of the hunter’s spear; others were
ground down to flour under the #aghraéi stones. The brave warriors
of the (Imperial) army redoubled their shots at their enemies of sash?
to grind down the latter between two stones for their bread at dinner;
others they minced into meat and gave a feast to animals of all kinds..
On that day of battle, from the appearance of the false dawn to the last
flicker of light the infidels were slain and streams of blood were made to
flow. * Some Hindi birds, with many deceptions, fled away from the
battle with their leader; before the Mussalmans could catch them,
they sprang up from their nests and tried to fly to Jalore. But the
swift-footed servants of the Emperor got news of this and laid
an ambush for them. Some they prevented from proceeding further ;
others they slew, /i// the wild, black crow of darkness assumed a white

The campaign against the wild animals being over, the intrepid
Emperor ordered his lion-hearted slave, Kamaluddin Gurg, to hunt
the beasts of the forest, and was confident that if the clouds rained
sharp arrows instead of drops of water, the ‘wolf’ would not raise up
his shield over his head, for he had known. many such showers. The
just protector of his subjects entrusted the cattle to the ‘ wolf’, in
order that he may guard the young she-goats from the thorns of the
territory. In a single hunting excursion such a famous victory befell
the Emperor. He moved his standard towards the ‘ Platform of the

Lions’ } (chautra-i shirdn) and the crescent banner was brought to the
‘Constellation of the Lion (Delhi) ’.?

2 *Next the Emperor started with his army for Siwana. There, too, was a
strong-armed Rai, named Satal Deo, whose ‘‘ stone’? had broken the balance of
other Rais. Hewas powerful like Ahrman and dll the razwats bowed to his
authority. In his fort of stone, which was stronger than iron, there were many
gaérs with hearts of steel. They had used their daggers and dispossessed other
rdis of their blankets. The Imperial army had been investing the fort for five or
six years without being able to injure half-a-brick of the edifice. But in asingle
move, the Emperor took his army to Siwana like a deluge, and Satal Deo, in spite
of his elephantine stature, was sent to sleep like an elephant through the vigilance
of the Emperor.’ ( Dawal Rani).

* While the Afalz& Nazb was in the Deccan, the Emperor marched against the
fort of Siwdna, which is to the south of Delhi. The army of Delhi had been
besieging it for some years without achieving anything. ‘Alauddin encircled
the fort and reduced the besieged to straits. Satal Deo, the Raja of Siwana,
humbly sent a silver effigy of himself with golden cords round its neck, a hundred
elephants, and other valuable presents to the Emperor and asked for his pardon.
The Emperor took this in good humour, but said that it would do no good till
Satal Deo came in person. The RAja perforce came out of the fort and paid his
respects to the Emperor. ‘Alauddin took possession of all that the fort contained,
even the knives and needles. Such articles as were of use to the government were
assigned to the royal factories; the rest were given over in payment of their
salaries to the troops and camp-followers. The territory was divided among the
amirs, ‘The empty fort was handed back to the Raja.

* About the same time the fort of Jalore was also conquered. It is said that
Kanir Deo, Raja of Jalore, came te pay his homage to the Emperor at Delhi.
‘« There is no zamindar in Hindiistan to-day strong enough to challenge my troops,”’
‘Alauddin declared on one occasion when Kanir Deo was presentin the majlis. ‘If
I challenge and do not prevail,’’ Kanir blurted out in his excessive ignorance and
folly, ‘ I will know how to die.’? The Emperor was annoyed at these words, but
said nothing, and permitted Kanir Deo to return to his territory. When some
two or three months had passed, the Emperor determined to show his strength.
He erdered a slave-girl, named Gul-i Bihisht, to march against Jalore and reduce
it by force. Gul-i Bihight reached her destination, besieged the fort and displayed
such wonderful courage that it never occurred to Kanir Deo to come out and offer
battle. The besieged were reduced to straits and the fort was about to fall when
Gul-i Bihisht suddenly fell illand died. Her son, Shahin,’ took the army in hand

CHAPTER V

CAMPAIGN OF ARANGAL

Now [ will deseribe the conquest of Tilang in such a way, thal the feet
of imagination will become lame in following my pen / 3 After
conquering many regions of the south, the brilliant judgment of the
Sultan of East and West came to the conclusion that the swarms of
Arangal must be trampled under the crescent horse-shoe of the army.
On 25th Jamadiul Awwal, 709 a.w. the Nausherwan of the age
ordered his Buzurchmehr?, accompanied by the red canopy of ‘the
‘ Shadow of God’ and an army like the stars and planets of the sky,
to lead his lucky horses to the south. The ruby canopy of the Sun of
Sultans, like a cloud that becomes red as the sun shines upon it,
began to move towards the sea of Ma‘bar. And as it commenced its
flight at the Emperor’s order, you would think it was a cloud, which
Mecca-going winds were carrying towards the sea. Following this
sky tied with ropes, the stars and planets of the army moved on, stage
after stage; after nine days the fortunate star of the state (i.e. the
waztr of the Empire) arrived at a propitious moment at Mas‘idpir.
At this place, which is named after the son of the Emperor Mas‘nd,
the foot of the standard remained stationary for two days. On
Monday, the 6th Jamadius Sani, the crescent standard of the Empire,
with the wadzks and other ‘stars’, began to move rapidly forward.
lt was the first part of the month. Every night the moon enlarged

and tried to overpower the besieged like his mother. But Kanir Deo now saw that
the Emperor’s anger was inevitable and determined to make a desperate struggle.
He collected all his men, came out of the fort and gave battle. As chance would
have it, Shahin and Kanir Deo came face to face and Shahin was killed. The
other airs, unable to continue the struggle, retreated a few Stages. ‘Alauddin
was furious at the news and sent Kam&luddin to lead the enterprise with a new
army. Kaméaluddin showed great activity and courage. He reduced the fort,
slew Kanir Deo with his sons and followers and seized his treasure. When the
message of victory reached Delhi, drums were beaten in joy.’ (Ferfshkia).

Ferishta is mistaken in stating that Satal Deo was deprived of his wealth and
allowed to live in his fort, Khusrau definitely states in both his works that Satal
Deo was slain, Ferishta’s mistake is due to the fact that he applies to Satal Deo
the verses in which Khusrau has described the fate of the Rai of Arangal.

its flame and raised it higher to help the night marches of the army.
And though the sun, the ‘Mecca’ of the Hindis, looked fiercely at
the Mussalmans, the feet of the army threw dust into itseye. es, the
eye that looks fiercely at such an army deserves no other antimony but black
dust, +The path before them was extremely uneven; there were
innumerable clefts in it, such that if the wind passed through them, it
would fail as water falls into a well, or if (flames of) fire ran
over them, they would bow down their heads to the earth. Owing to
the rapidity of the streams, the ground at the foot of the hills had
broken into many fissures. Every mound had a hundred thousand
pointed thorns stuck to its head; the very idea of cutting such rocks
and thorns made the hair of a pair of scissors stand upon its body
like thorns. Through such a forest the obedient army passed, file
after file, as if that perfect wilderness were the ‘straight path’.
After six days of marching, the army crossed five rivers—Jin,
Chambal, Kunwéari, Binds, Bhojit—at the fords and came to
Sultanpir, known as [rijptir. ere the army renained for four days.
3On the 19th Jamadius Sani, the Malik of the brilliant fortune*
mounted his horse, and the ‘stars’ of the Empire began to move.
The vider was above, the horse was below ; it looked as tf * stars’ were
riding on the backs of the planets. ° From farsang to farsaug every
stone on the way had its ‘head’ broken by the hoofs of the horses
though nothing came out of its ‘skull’. The movement of cloven-footed
baggage bearers despoiled the earth of its bloom. The swift parks
(footmen) rent the hills with their iron feet; indeed, as these
pedestrians hurried over the ground with firmness and impetuosity,
on one side the stones pierced into the soles of their fect, while on the other,
their feet removed the skin from the skulls of the stones.

1 After thirteen days, on the first of Rajab, the army arrived at
Khanda. In such a wilderness the month of God 2 came forward to
welcome the Muslim army, and showed great kindness to the pious
men, who had travelled under the hot sun for three months. Here
a muster of the holy warriors was held for fourteen days. The
angels sent their blessings. The prayer for victory came to the‘ ears’
of Rajab, and it hurried forward with the joyful news of future victories
like those of the past.

On this auspicious occasion all the sa/iks, officers and Jeading men
of the army gathered together before the red canopy, and kept their days
alive by hearing prayers for the Jesus-like Emperor; moreover by keep-
ing the ‘ fast of Mary’ (réza-1-Maryam), they collected provisions for
their future life. There can be no doubt that an extremely pious
assembly had gathered round the sky-shadowing canopy; even the
saints (a@/ad) were present. They held fast to the ' strong cord’, and
no (differences) had any place amongst them. ‘The august month of
Rajab heard with solemnity and joy the prayers for the Emperor and
for victory. ° Next morning, after the ‘ fast of Mary’, the army again
advanced like araging deluge. Through rivers and torrents it passed.
Every day it came to a new land; in every land it came across a new
river in which the quadrupeds rolled like five-footed animals.
Though all the rivers were crossed, yet the Narbada looked like a
remnant of the primeval deluge. As the miraculous power of the
Emperor-Sultan was with the officers of the kingdom, the deep
rivers became dry as the dust of the army approached them, and the
Mussalmans crossed them with ease. Eight days after crossing
the Narbada, the army reached Nilkanth. When these wide rivers
make a way for the Imperial army to cross, there would be nothing
wonderful if it also forded through the Nile of Egypt and the Tigres of
Baghdad.

* As Nilkanth was on the border of Deogir, and the territories of
the Rai Rayan, Ram Deo, had now been reached, the wazir, acting accord-
ing to the Emperor's orders, protected the country from being plundered
by the troops, who were as innumerable as antsand locusts. No one

dared touch the door or the wall of a building or take anything from the
barns or fields of the peasant. The stores of the ants did not become the
food of the locusts.» The drums, which sounded to march, were detain-
ed here for two days in order to make inquiries about the stages in
advance. On Wednesday, the 26th Rajab, the movement of the army
again shook the bowels of the earth, and the ground began to rise up
and go down like the belly of a Ahatkhana-blower, Trampling the
earth under their feet and splitting stones with force, the army defiled
through such a dangerons path. In sixteen days the difficult road to
Tilang was traversed. The ground was overlaid with hard rocks,
which the Hindiis had often (vainly) attempted to cross ; yet these heavy
rocks flew away like dust at the feet of the quadrupeds of the Muslim
army. The eye of the sky gazed in wonder; for the road went up and
down like the subtle wit of a clever cheat and was at the same tine as long
as amiser’s greed. Andinatlempting to describe its hills and caverns, the
intelligence of the panegyrist would bow its head in wonder. * The path
was narrower than a guitar string and darker than a beauty’s locks.
At times it was like a hole in a reed: when the wind attempted to pass
through it, it came out reverberating. The river-banks were so steep
that it would have been difficult for a duck, or even an eagle, to cross
them. Pretending that they knew the way, nimble-bodied men attempt-
ed to ascend the heights on either side ; but their feet slipped all of a
sudden ; their attempts to catch hold of the steep sides were ineffectual;
and rubbing their hands together, they fell down with innumerable
.wounds. The neighing horses, that danced in the air, would fall down
in a moment owing to one false step. Yes / Many a dancing horse tlew
swift asthe wind; Gut once its foot slipped down the hillside, it tumbled
and fell, 3 Purthermore, as the dark-faced cloud brought forth its
unfinished pearls to worry the people of the army, the wind struck it
hard on the neck, and all its water was shed. Whenever the forked
lightning laughed at the slipping feet of the army, the thunder roared
so loudly at the latter that itimmediately disappeared. You would have
thought that the cloud was envious of the ocean-like palm of the
Emperor’s hand, but being powerless to do anything at the Imperial
Court, sought consolation by attacking the army. The lightning, on

the other hand, had been struck with fire by the Imperial sword; but
unable to display its impudence in the Emperor’s presence had
gone thither to reveal its burning heart. ?Though the holy warriors
met many obstacles in this journey, yet they had girded their loins
sincerely for the sake of Allah alone, and had their eyes on that final
reward, the hope of which sustains the human heart. Consequently, they
did not regard their sufferings as serious. In a thousand ways the
assistance of Heaven, too, was withthem, Good fortune accompanied
young and old over hills and valleys, rocks and thorns, desert and
forest, even as victory accompanies the Muslim standard,

2After passing with determination and rapidity through those
hills and plains, they arrived at a Doad within the borders of Basi-
ragarh?. It was enclosed by the two rivers, Yashar and Bujit.
A diamond mine was said to exist there. Butas the power of Imperial
sword, through the strength of which all the treasures of the vais have
come into the hands of Muslim soldiers, had given strength to the
officers of the state, they did not care to take handfuls of earth from
the pits; for it is easier for powerful swordsmen /o seize jewels with the
sword than to dig them out of the earth with thespade. * About this time
the Malik, with the impetuosity of a dragon, left the difficulties of the
winding path, and with some dare-devil horsemen, marched against
the fort of Sarbar, which belonged to the kingdom of Tilang. The
saddles were still stinging like scorpions on the backs of the horses,
when he ordered the warriors to make a circle round the fort. The
archers shot their arrows from outside. ‘Strike!’ ‘Strike!’ cried the.
Hinds from within. The vawats of the Rai were so bitten by the
poisoned arrows, that they wished to take refuge in the holes of
ants for protection, and like thousand-footed animals crept into every
corner. The arrows had made snake-holes in the bodies of many and
their lives were in danger. The movement of crocodile-like warriors
shook the earth to the back ofthe Fish.6 7\When the swift arrows,
with fiery flames at the end of their wood-pieces, began to fly

forward to burn the houses of the infidels, their faces grew dark
at the approach of this wall of fire. In the excess of their folly,
they drew the fire on to themselves; ie. all of them with their
w.ves and children threw themselves into fire and went to hell. For
fire is_the reward of the enemies of Allah! The exterior of the fort
became bright owing to this illumination of the pit of hell. The bodies
of the victors were like flints in armours of steel; they cast away
their armours and jumped up from the rocks as a spark flies out of flint.
At this moment the breeze of victory suddenly blew fast, and the lames
inside the fort rose higher still. The impetuous soldiers of the Muslim
atmy drew their swords like so many tongues of fire, climbed up the
fort, and falling on the half-burnt mass, put to death with their Hind-
steel those whom fire had spared. Matters having come to this, the
remaining mugaddams of the fort also wished to sacrifice themselves
in the same element. At this instant, the ‘472-2 Mumaltk, Sirajud-
din, saw that it was time to light the lamp of victory. An4&nir, the
brother of the mxgaddam of the fort, had hidden himself in the culti-
vated fields of that land. The ‘Arz-2 Afumalik ordered him to be
captured and given a severe chastisement. At first, allured with soft
words, he was kept for being beheaded and burnt; but, nest,
this low-burning Iamp of the Hindus (i.e. Andnir) was given a
tongue (to ask) for his life, so that before morning the flame of
insurrection might subside.t As the smoke of destruction rose
from this fort to the sky, some refugees from the burning edifice,
with their eyes full of water, fled to Rai (Laddar Deo), and like moist
wood, with weepings and wailings, gave vent to the inner sorrow of
their hearts. The az, who possessed elephants and troops, was also
overcome by fear but he did not think it advisable to advertise it. So
he bewailed his fate for a while and thus soothed his inner sadness.
But when the fire of misfortunes ts lit, tears from the eyes burn in it like oil.

2Qn Saturday, the 10th of Sha’ban, they marched from here
determined to plant the tree of virtue in the land of Tilang and to

live. after being scolded (oiled) with the tongue and threatened with death,
Ananir had the fort restored to him on promise of obedience, so that ‘ the flame of
insurrection might subside.’ It was not a part of ‘Alauddin’s programme to
establish his government over the conquered territory and, consequently, the
legitimate successor of the late »ngaddam had to be found, so that the required
promise of obedience may be taken from him,

uproot With the greatest force the tree of vice, that had fixed its roots
there. On the 16th Sha’bin the true believers arrived at the village
of Kiinarbal. While the pious standard was being planted, the
Malik: Nath, commander of the army of heaven, ordered a thousand
swift horsemen—and they were such that the crow of victory did not
build its nest except on their bows !—to go forward and capture a few
infidels, though the daggers of the latter may be as numerous as the
leaves of'a willow, in order to make inquiries from them about the con-
dition of the country. When this force reached the gardens of Arangal,
the iron of their horse-shoes turned green from walking over the
grass. Two famous officers with forty mounted horsemen went
forward and reached the summit of the Anamkanda Hill, from where
they could see all the suburbs and gardens of Arangal.’ On looking
earefully from the hill, four swift Hindh horsemen came into sight.
The Musalamins drew their bows and ran after them. They suc-
ceeded in knocking down one of the four with a four-feathered
arrow and sent him to the Commander-in-Chief, The latter took it
asa good omen. ‘ Thus with my sword’, he said, ‘ will I peel away
the skin from the heads of such Hinds as rebels’.

2 When the army reached Arangal, the red canopy rubbed its head
with the clouds, At midday the Afalzk Naib, accompanied by a few
men, went to reconnoitre the fort (of Arangal). He saw a fort, the
like of which is not to be found on the face of the earth.
3 Its wall, though of mud, was so hard that a spear of steel could
make no impression upon it; if a m#eghrabi-stone were to strike it, it
would rebound like a nut thrown by a child. Its earthen towers were
stronger than Taurus, and the Orion only came up to its waist.
Nevertheless, the standards of infidelity trembled on the top of all the
towers in expectation of their downfall, while the ‘cradas of Hindus
wept from fear of being broken. The warlike rawats, with all their
heavy stones, had thrown themselves into the sling of destruction ;
some of them were collecting stones for the munjanigs ; others, who
had no stones, were busy in throwing bricks and javelins. That day
the victorious Afalzk carefully selected the ground for the army-camp
and returned, Next morning he intended to carry the battle forward, and

in good news, to throw stones at the heads ot the Hindas. + When
morning dawned and the sun rose, the sky-towering standard of
the eastern Empire was raised up and brought to Anamkonda.
Once more the great Afal7k went round the fort to re-examine the
ground for the army-camp. Zte tents were to be pitched side by Side, as
the Aquarius lies in the neighbourhood of the Pisces,

It was the 15th of Sha’ban, when in the middle of the month of
the Prophet, the ruby canopy was fixed so high that it over-topped
the Ramazan crescent. On that night Khwaja Nasirul Mulk
Sirajuddoulah (May God illuminate the nights of his life !) personally
arranged the troops with a lighted lamp. Every division was sent
to its appointed place, in order to surround the fort and to protect
the besiegers from the shots of the besieged and from whatever
compounas of atr and fire the latter might bring forth to set fire to the
external wall of bronze. * When the august canopy had been fixed a wl
from the gate of Arangal, the tents around the fort were pitched
together so closely that the ‘head’ of a needle could not go between
them. Inside the fort the Hindiis slept at ease, like reclining yard-
measures; outside the watchmen of the Imperial army were wide awake.
Every dzmdan was assigned one thousand two hundred yards of land;
the total circumference of the fort, as enclosed by the tents, was twelve
thousand five-hundred and forty-six yards.* De land of infidelity was
mnade to look like a cloth market owing to the innumerable tents.

5 The victorious army drew into ranks like the teeth of a saw and
the heart of the Hindiis was cut into two. Every soldier was ordered
to erect a Kath-garh (wooden defence) behind his tent. Immediately
all hatchets became busy and every soldier was transformed into
Ishaq, the wood-cutter. Trees that had never been molested by the
stones of those who wished to eat their fruits, were now felled with
iron axes in spite of their groans; and the Hindiis, who worship trees,
were unable to come to the rescue of their gods in their need. Every
accursed tree in that land of infidelity was cut down toits roots. Clever
carpenters sharpened their instruments on the tree-trunks and soon cut

them into proper shape with their axes. Finally, a wooden fence
was built round the army. It was so strong, that if fire had rained
from the sky, ¢he croaden forl would have been as sate tram fire as Noah's
ark was from walter.

? When the Hindii-faced evening had made a night-attack on the sun
and sieep had closed the portals of the eyes and besieged the fort of
the pupil®, the watchmen, with their shields on their backs and
their drawn swords in their hands, drew into a double row to keep
guard over the Imperial camp and with the strokes of their eyelashes
drove sleep out of their cyes. Near midnight, when the meteors had be-
gun to shoot towards the besieged demons and the moon had brought
forth its full shield, a thousand swift Hindi: horsemen from the troops
of Banik Deo, the mugaddam of that country, made a night-attack on the
Muslim army with demonish cries and the Hindi sword. God forbid
thaé such an arny should tear such an attack! FAs a matter of fact, the
crocodiles of the besieging army who had themselves been waiting
in an ambush for this armoured fish caught the latter with their
Hindi swords like fish in anet. From fear of the enemy’s maces and
clubs, the Hindais drew their heads into their armours like tortoises.
The heads of the rdwafs rolled like crocodile-eggs on the fish-backed
earth. In an instant many of these aquatic creatures had been drowned
in a deluge of their own blood and Jay like slaughtered fish. Those
wounded by spears and arrows cricd as frogs ery when caught
by snakes. Others who tried to run away received wounds on
their backs, which like cancer-sores opened a door forthe entry of
death. * Finally, most of the Hindiis were cither killed, overpowered
or driven away. Some of them cut off their horse-belts in order
to fly more quickly, but the anvil-piercing holy warriors came out of
their iron lines and pursued them, determined to strike the
Hindi sword at infidel hearts. Every Hind found in the neigh-
bourhood was either slain with the Hindi sword and the ‘Tatir-
arrow or sent as a prisoner to the army.

Now some of the prisoners happened to declare that in the town
of Dahdiim, six farsangs from Tilang, three elephants, such as could

tear up the back of a hill with their iron teeth, had been secretly
hidden. Immediately, at the order of the Commander-in-Chief of the
Imperial army, three thousand brave horsemen, led by Qara Beg
Maisarah, galloped away in that direction. But when they reached the
. said fort; the elephants had been carried further still and inevitably a
further distance had to be traversed. Thanks to the unlimited good
fortune of the Emperor, all the three elephants fell into the hands
of his officers. The elephants, on their part, were busily pulling their
chains in their anxiety to reach the Imperial Court. When they were
brought to the army camp, the war-like Afa/ik considered the acquisi-
tion of these three iron forts a great achievement and kept them,
along with the other elephants, for the Imperial stables. /ndced, he
had seen all this tn the mirror of his sword and without the help of any
conqurer or fortune-teller.

t As the Commander-in-Chief of the army, who was also the Gigerial
Chamberlain, was very fond of polo (chaugan), he ordered his
enthusiastic men to go on playing the game against the mzgaddams
of Laddar Deo, day after day. He motioned to them with his
brow, that wheresoever they came across a desperate rawat, they
were to take his head for a ‘ ball’ and bring it to their camp. Having
received this wide permission, the sportive horsemen considered it a
great fun to separate the heads from the bodies of a very large
number. Every horseman in the army whipped his animal and in
several matches brought away the ‘bails’ of those desperate Hindi
warriors ; for you might consider their blood-smeared heads as colour-
ed balls brought to the presence of the chaugédu-loving Malik. Further,
the Afaltk ordered stone-balls for the waghrabis to be collected all
round the fort; so that with the strokes of the balls the fort may
be won and reduced to dust in another match, *As the external
munjanigs drew their strength from the virtuous tree of faith, they did
great damage to the infidel edifice, but the inner ‘zrddas, being con-
structed from the tree of infidelity, naturally yielded before the impe-
tuosity of Muslim stones. The stones of the Mussalmans all flew
high, owing to the power of ‘the strong cable,’ and hit the mark,
while the balls of the Hindtis were shot feebly as from a Brahman’s
thread, and consequently went wrong.

!When the sabals and gargajes were completed and rose so high
that the garrison of the fort was placed suddenly on a lower clevation,
the fort ditch began to talk of its great depth to the Muslim army.
Though the latter looked sternly at it and took measure of its depth, it
would not allow the army to cross; and opening wide its two lips, spoke
of the security of the fort. Ultimately, the Mussalmains threw mud
into its mouth, and filled it in so completely that ils two lips were joined
together. Of this there could be no doubt. Further, one wing of the
fort-wall, for about the length of a hundred hands, was broken so
thoroughly by the stroke of large stones, that it could not rise high
enough to embrace the Hindiis below the arm-pits. On the other side,
also, the havoc wrought by the »agArabi stones had created new doors
in the gate-wall. All these doors of victory which Divine assistance
had opened for the Imperial officers Ves every crack in the enemy's wall
ts a door of victory for the friend, When owing to the continuous
piling up of the earth, a mound had risen from the bottom of the ditch
to the waist of the fort, and the mud wall of the fort had become
a heap of dust from the strokes of the stone-balls, they desired to
construct a pdashkib so wide that files of hundred men abreast may
ascend over it to the fort. But the construction of the pashid would
have taken a few days; and Victory, in her haste, was dancing on the
sword’s point. The rightly guided HWacir called the AZaltés to a council
of discussion, and their correct judgment was to the effect, ‘ that before
the construction of the pash7b, a hand-to-hand struggle should beattempied,
and as Viclory is on our side, may be she will come running.’

3 The night of Tuesday, the 11th Ramazan, was so bright that its
shining moon imparted it the brilliance of Lazlatul Qadr.4 The tarawth
prayers asked for heavenly help with a loud voice. The blessing of
the fasting day had collected the rewards of the victors, and Fortune
used the lock of the night as her ladder for descending from heaven to
earth. The Pletades had lifted their hand tn prayer that key of victory may
fall into them! 3 The exalted Wazir ordered high ladders and all other
requisites to be constructed in every division (£hail) in the course of
the night, whenever the drum beat to action, everyone was to come

out of his entrenchment and carry the ladders to the fort, so that the
work of victory might be exalted step by step. When in the morning the
sun in Gemini had clothed the sky with a waist-band of light, the
holy warriors ran towards water and took off their socks in order to
put on their armour. ‘After performing their ablution—and every
drop of ablution-water is a sharp arrow for Satan’s heart, for ablution
is a Mussaiman’s armour !—they were ready for prayer and turned
their faces towards God. The Sah-kash also bowed in the obliga-
tory prayer, and raised his hands to ask Heaven for victory and
success. He begged the ‘King of Khaibar’? to plead before God,
from whom all good originates, for the reduction of the fort, and
instantly the keys of victory fell into his hands from the Unseen
Gate. Some waiting was, however, still necessary, for everything
has its appointed time.

2 When the golden shield of the sun had risen a spear high, the
Malik Naté ordered his men to begin the attack and the blood of
the * gabrs’ was shed in the worthless fort even as the Censor of morals
throws away carnation-coloured wine. The beat of the leathern
drum—‘and the thunder declares His glory with His praise’—
resounded through the vault of the sky. The trumpets of the
holy warriors raised their voices on every side. ‘Here! I am
for you,’ cried Victory as she came running. Bold men with
scaling ropes began to jump up to the fort-wall like lions in the
forest. The arrows fell thick like showers of therainy season and pierced
the breast of the Hinds even as rain drops get into the mothers-of-
pearl. Powerful diggers, with the greatest noise, sat down to open a
way into the tort. One half of the earthen fort flew up like dust to
the sky ; the other half threw itself down to seek protection from the
ground. The excellent bow of the Turks rubbed its sides with the
sky and claimed to be the bow of Rustam, while their arrows, all
flying together, looked like the cloud of Bahman. Others had
applied their spades to the fort-wall; you would have thought they

were ‘arguing away ’ the foundations of the edifice with their eloquent
tongues. Some had thrust their sword-points into the solidified
earth as if determined to carve fine figures out of it. The wooden
ladders raised their feet to the highest elevation from the greatest
depth for the sake of Isliim; and the earthen fort threw the Hindiis
down from its height in order to degrade infidelity. The sagAribis
outside exchanged shots with the ‘77ddas inside the fort; it seemed as
if young men and veiled brides were throwing loving stones at each
other; for either side exercised the greatest attraction, and with
unclosing eyes marked the thousand tricks of the other. If one ball
was discharged from outside, it fell as two balls within; but if two
balls were discharged from within, no misfortune befell the proclaimers
of the one God. Praise be to God for his exaltation of the Muslim
faith! There can be no doubt that stones are worshipped by the
gabrs; but, as they were unable to give their worshippers any assistance,
the gadrs threw them up to the sky and then down tothe earth. And it
was proper that the stones should be struck against the ground, Next
some footmen of the Muslim army climbed with their hand-nails over
the earthen fort; and having found the moon in the Taurus, they
permanently purchased the land and buildings of that territory with
the Alai coin.) Though the fort had been so excellently constructed,
that there was nothing on its walls that one could catch hold of
or lay one’s finger on, yet the besiegers clung to it with the
edges of their nails; and even as a wise man overcomes a fool, they
boldly climbed to the summit of the fort. And God enabled
them to bring one wing of the fort into their strong and powerful
hands. Thai night they established themselves there in force, and broke
the legs of those who wanted to dislodge them.

On Sunday, the 13th Ramazan—Sunday, being a day dedicated to
the Sun—the sun had so illuminated the night, that it merged insensi-
bly into the day, thus giving the holy warriors a greater time for
action. Asthe moon withdrew its shield beyond the western horizon,
the men of the army drew their swords and attacked the fort from the
east. The drummers awakened the sleeping war-drum which leapt
up from its sleep at their beats; and it seemed that the four elements of
the sphere would dissolve into chaos at its noise. The war cries of

the warriors, the sounds of ‘Huzza! Huz!’ and ‘ Khuzza! Khuz!’
resounded through the world.! The assistance sent from the smoky
sky for the Muslim army descended through the ethereal sphere ; and
bringing fire with it from there, fell on the gaé7’s places of refuge.
And in its liberality with human life, the fire turned these stingy people
into enormous heaps of ashes. When the tongues of fire had descended
low, the standard of the Sultanate rose onthe fort. Allpraises are for
Allah who raised it so high!

2 By Wednesday, a day dedicated to Mercury (Archer), the Emperor’s
fierce troops had as easily entered the mud fort as a warrior’s arrow
breaks through and upsets a bubble. The inner fort, which resembled
the (Arabian) Khaibar, was invested. No Hindi was allowed to cross
the line of the besiegers just as dogs had not been allowed to come
out of Khaibar (by the Mussalmans); if a Hindi had attempted
to do so, his heart would have been cut open by the arrow that
could pierce through seven plates of steel. When the Alexandrian lines
had surrounded the inner fort by a wall of iron, they saw a buiiding,
the stones of which rose up to the sky ; and even the sky had raised its
mirror higher (lest it might break from contact) with the rocky towers.
Its stones were joined so carefully together that the head of a needle
could not get in between them; its walls were so smooth that a fly
attempting to sit on them would have slipped down. Its stones and
plaster had been welded so excellently together that the tongue of the
spade was unable to separate them. In addition to this, there was such
a wonderful charm in its walls and buildings that no maghrabi had
the heart to do them any wrong. You might say that the fort was a
stiff spear, which the ant could not climb, or else that it was a flute, in
which the wind lost itself as in a wooden pipe. Its towers stood
upright in the air and ascended to the moon; its foundations sank
deep in the earth, down to the Fish. The watchman on its towers
bathed his head with the clouds ; the digger at its foundations washed
his feet with water. .

3 When the multitudinous army came to the lip of the ditch, they
found its mouth full of water ; if anyone talked to it about crossing to
the other side, it tried to drag him_down to the bottom. The

swordsmen of the army, however, would not float any boat on the
ditch but determined to swim through it together. They practised on
the face of the water every rule of mensuration they knew, and, in a
moment, crossed the ditch, file after file, more easily than a
boat would have done. They determined to sum up all their
resolution and to bore holes into the stomach (of the fort) as in
a reed. With the passion of Farhad, they wished to knock down
the edifice so completely that it may not be propped up by a
thousand columns and to pull down its towers with such force that the
‘heads’ of the towers would come down while their‘ feet’ went up. In
short, they resolved to seize the fort so effectively from the Hinds
that even its dust might not be left in the latter’s hands. Yes, Yes,
Even the dust zs reluctant to remain with the infidel. + Rai Laddar Deo
sat inside the fort like a snake over buried treasure and called his
people around him. His elephants pulled their chains in pride of the
gold they bore; but the Rai was thinking of his war with the golden
scorpions and watery pearls trickled down his inner eye at the thought
(of losing his enormous treasures). He wished to look into the future,
but his eyes refused to obey him. He had been brave and courageous
in the siege; yet whenever he reflected on the situation in which he
was placed, his stout heart began to palpitate; and if he wished to re-
move the heaviness of his heart by saying farewell to all his treasures,
his heart struck against his breast, and told him that it could not, at least,
separate itself from so much gold as remains sticking to a black touch-
stone. He had fastened his hopes on being able to place before
the invaders an obstacle, which would cause them to stumble and
retrace their steps. But the Emperor’s prestige overawed him; all
his courage melJted away and he was left a broken man. In his
helplessness, he first collected in heaps the treasure he had buried
under stones more heavy than can be dragged from the hills, in ‘order
to provide for his ransom, Next he constructed a golden image of
himself, and in acknowledgment of having become a tribute-payer,
he placed a golden chain round its neck and sent it through ambas-
sadors, whose honest word was more unchanging than the purest gold,
to the Commander of the Imperial army.

‘The opposition of the rice-made Hindi,’ ran the Rai’s petition,
‘to the iron bodies of the Mussalmans is like a silver-faced beauty
challenging Rustam to battle. This being the case the servant, Laddar
Deo, has been forced to lay aside his own bronze ‘body in a corner.
Fear of the Emperor’s Hindi sword has turned me pale, or, rather, my
body of stone has become golden in the rays of the Imperial sun.
‘ Consequently, I have constructed an exact image of myself, which is
being sent to promise tribute and obedience at the review. I hope
the Imperial officers will intercede for me at the Court, and inform
the Emperor that fear of him has rendered the broken body of this
servant even more lifeless than this golden statue, and that I will
only feel signs of life in myself on the day when the wind of Imperial
favour blows over my dead body.

‘TE the good-will of the officers of the world-protecting Court is
to be won by treasure and valuables, I have as much gold with me as
will suffice to gild all the mountains of Hind. All this immense goid
belongs to the Emperor and I will not turn my face toitagain. But if
the world-adorning Imperial will, as a favour to the weak, gives back
a few gold coins to this unfortunate Hindu, it will exalt him (Laddar
Deo) to a dignity superior to that of all other Rais. For the desire of
gold is found in every heart. It is only the mirror (heart) of the
Second Alexander that can turn its back towards this metal, for his
sword has absorbed the gold of the whole world. Concerning his
sword only can the proverb, that ‘“* magnet draws iron and iron draws
gold”, be true. And if the Emperor really wants the gold posses-
sed by a poor man like me, so much the better! For what princi-
pality is more fortunate than the one which draws the Emperor's
heart towards itself. I will keep none of this gold-dust for myself, for
my heart has been broken by the fear of Emperor’s infidel slaying
sword. And every one knows, that when an earthen vessel breaks, you
cannot repair it with gold-dust. If precious stones, gems and pearls?
are demanded, I have a stock of them such as the eyes of the moun-
tains have not seen and the ears of the fish have not heard of. Ail
these will be scattered on the path of the Imperial officers. For if I

their eats have been opened; they draw a deed on the ground with their
trunks to the effect that henceforth they will never turn their faces
towards the Ka'ba of Islim except in worship. They are coming with
their feet like pillars and their heads like the dome of the gate of
obedience—so that, if the Imperial officers choose to be angry at them,
the elephants will submit to it with the “skirts” of their ears; and if
order for the punishment of rebels is given, the elephants will execute
it with their teeth. God has given them a forehead peculiarly fitted to
render obedience at the Imperial Court. They are now scattering dust
over their heads before the Hinda's door, but in the Empezror's presence their

broken by the heavy anxiety of earning a livelihood; if my life is
taken, the scale holding my wealth will sink to the ground. In either
case the balance will be upset. This being the case, I consider myself
a broken stirrup; it is for the just Emperor to set the balance right.

and hand them over to the Emperor's officers at his command. If the

2 When the messengers of the Rai came before the red canopy, the
honoured harbinger of victory and triumph, they rubbed their yellow
faces on the earth till the ground itself acquired their colour; next
they drew out their tongues in eloquent Hindi, more sharp than the
Hindi sword, and delivered the message of the Rai. The idol-breaking
Malik comprehended the gilding of the Hindis and paid no regard to
their glozing speech. He would not even look at the golden statue,
which he wished to throw back at their faces. But he communicated
to the army the command of the Second Alexander, which is more firm
than seven walls of steel and the garden of Shaddad.* The Imperial
officers swore by the head of Khizr Khan, the emerald in the ring of the
kingdom, that they would accept the gold and raise the siege. As

2A curious quibble of which it is difficult to find the exact significance.
Laddar Deo seems to have meant that if either his life or the whole of his property
was taken away, the balance would be upset. If they took away his life, ‘the
scale holding my wealth would sink to the ground ’—perhaps a veiled threat that
in the last extremity he would subject bis jewels to the hammer. What he desired
was that the victor should leave him some part of his wealth, and take instead of it
a portion of his prestige by subjecting him to a yearly tribute, . When equals are
taken from equals the remainders are equal; and Laddar Deo, left with a
part of his prestige and a part of his wealth, would straight-away attack the other
Rais and pay the Imperial tribute out of their pockets.

the motntain-rending troops were unable to violate the oath, and the
coin of forgiveness had also been repeatedly issued from the Imperial
Court, the decision arrived at was to the effect that they would subject
the Rai toa tribute, but as a charitable offering for the life of the
forgiving Emperor, they would spare his life in exchange for the
golden statue. They would take away and deliver at the Court all
animals, vegetables and minerals which the Rai’s territory contained ;
and if there was the slightest deficit in handing over the treasures
agreed upon, they would render the Rai as lifeless as the golden
image and reduce the fort to a heap of ashes like a goldsmith’s
forge. On this condition, the fort-conquering Malik stretched forth
his right hand, placed his sword in its scabba1d, and struck his open
hand, by way of admonition, so forcibly on the backs of the ambas-
sadors that they bent under the blow. Though the agreement was
permanent and not provisional, yet the poor ambassadors trembled
like quicksilver; and thus trembling and impatient, they hurried back
to the fort. Their influence fell on the Rai and he too began to shake
like a gold-leaf. The ambassadors ornamented their speech, but the
Rai could not regain his stability, and wished to turn into mercury
and run away. With some difficulty they ran this quicksilver into a
vessel, and through soft speech puta little wax on its mouth?, Mex?
they busied themselves with alchemy in order to pay the gold they had
promised.

2The Rai’s council spent the night in collecting their precious
stones and valuables in order to present them next morning to the
Imperial officers. When next day the sun showed its face through the
enamelled fort, the ambassadors proved their promises to be as truthful
as the dawn. With their elephants, treasures and horses, they arrived
before the red canopy which is the roof ofthe easternsun. The Malik
sumunoned the leaders of the army and took his seat at the high place
to which he had been appointed by the Emperor; the other great
officers took their seats according to their positions, while the nobles
and commons collecfed round like stars. Then the ambassadors were
called, They placed their heads on the ground before the canopy of

the ‘Shadow of God’ and presented their elephants to the assembly.!
The ‘ Maliks’ sat while the elephants passed ; you would have thought
the planets had become stationary while the constellations had begun to move.

2The elephants were such as neither the brush of the artist can
portray nor the.pen of the panegyrist describe. Every one of them
was a throne fit for a king, and an ivory factory inside. It moved
without props and yet stood on four columns. Its back was adorned
by a jewelled litter; it sometimes carried a litter and sometimes a
load. Its banner (trunk) rose from its back like a spear into the air,
while its feet cast their shields (foot-prints) on the ground. It wore a
dress of living velvet. Its furious onslaught could uproot a tree. Its
tusks came out of either side, and in spite of their strength, had been
plaited over with gold. Contented to live on rice, in its anger it
could, nevertheless, drink up a whole pond. It threw forward its
trunk like a rope, while its eyes remained behind as if in ambush.
It would sit down respectfully when its driver wished to climb to its
back. Entrusting the guardianship -of its eyes to its ears, it had
surrounded its two lamps (eyes) with soft cartilage and fed them with
a gentle breeze by the movement of its ears. Its teeth were set
firmly inside ; its tusks rose like ivory pillars surrounded by gold. A
tall building on four columns, it raised its head into the air, while its
nose came to the ground; there was a crescent on its forehead, and
its tail rested on its buttocks. It looked like a hill with a long sash
for a nose, or else like a camel with a crocodile stuck to its front. It
carried its wine-glass in its head, and liquor was distilled from its
ears. Without any particular sorrow, it scattered dust over its head;
without any weakness, its body felt heavy. It looked like a cloud
arisen out of the sea-shore, wearing vermilion tulips on its forehead
and green leaves in its ears. Every one of them had these qualities,
and yet each was better than the other—for each was like the
mountain and yet like the wind; soft to walk and firm to stand;
Hindt-slayer and yet infidel property; baggage-carrier as well as
warrior; it carried a load on its back and its face looked towards the
Court, for if strong-necked, it was also obedient; the ebony-coloured

manufacturer of ivory, it carried its head high and at the same time
kissed the ground; a meet seat for the king, and a servant of the
Court, its body was heavy and its paces were gentle ; it could break
the enemy-lines, and yet fight in ordered ranks. <Axd when they move
together in a row, there is an earthquake of Fad! Fad! and Sat ! Sat!

1 After the elephants had passed, the treasures they carried on
their backs were displayed. The boxes were full of valuables and
gems, the excellence of which drove the onlookers mad. Fivery emerald
(zabarjad) sparkled in the light of the sun, or, rather, the sun reflected
back the light of the emerald. The rubies (y@gf/) dazzled the eye of
the sun and if a ray from them had fallen on a lamp of fire, the lamp
would have burst into flames, The ‘Cat’seye’ (‘azzzl hirrafl) was such
that alion after seeing it would have looked with contempt at the sun;
and the ‘ Cock’s eye’ (‘azuud dik) were so brilliant that the ‘Cat’s eye’
was afraid to look at it. The lustre of the rubies (/a‘/) illuminated the
darkness of the night and fhe mine, as you might light one lamp from
another. The emeralds had a fineness of water that could eclipse the
lawn of paradise. The diamonds (z/mds) would have penetrated into an
iron heart like an arrow of steel, and yet owing to their delicate nature,
would have been shattered by the stroke of a hammer. The other
stones were such that the sun blushed to look atthem. As for the
pearls, you would not find the like of them, even tf you kept diving into the
sea through all eternity. The gold was like the full moon of the twelfth
night; it seemed that in order to ripen it, that alchem?st the sun,
had lighted its fire, and the morning had blown its breath, for years.

2 When the horses were brought, the prestige of all that the
ambassadors had previously displayed flew away like the wind. Lest
the struggle should be further prolonged, every horse in the Rai’s
palace and stables had been brought; even the wind of them
was not left in his hands. The sight of these fleet-footed animals
captivated every heart—¢he heart of the Mussalman was broken, and the
soul of the Hindu tlew away from his breast; for the horses were such as
their eyes had never seen.

Mumalik went to examine the jewels. He divided them into ‘genus’
and ‘ species’, ‘class’ after ‘class’, and had everything written down.
He then stood up and turned to the ambassadors. It was clear to his
perfect judgment that the wealth and property of the Rai had been
wholly confiscated, and that no jewel had been kept away from its
proper place. Yet as a diplomatic formality, he propounded
‘ propositions ' before the wise ambassadors, and ultimately unfolded to
them the ‘ major’ and the ‘ minor premises’. In an address, full of a
variety of meaning, he put it to them: ‘ You are acquainted with
every “ species” (of this treasure). If on investigation a single item
‘is found missing, though your life is “ indivisible’’, yet will I destroy
it; and with the stroke of the sword, I will divide your parts (limbs)
into indivisible “‘atoms’’. ‘Take care and state the true premises !
‘Tell me, as all the gems of the Rai are excellent, has he sent the best
of them hither? How has he classified “talking” and “ neighing
animals’? (men and horses) and what portion of them has he
retained ? 72

‘ By. the God, who has created man, the finest of “‘ substances ”’ !2
swore the philosophic ambassadors, ‘ Each of these jeweis is of a
“kind” of which no man can calculate the value. And among them is
a jewel, unparalleled in the whole world, though according to perfect
philosophers such a substance cannot exist.? Before this time

1 Khwaja Haji’s meaning is obvious. If the Rai had failed to send any
valuables, which by the agreement he was bound to, the ambassadors would
be held responsible for the default, provided they were cognisant of it.
As the Imperial army could not énter the fort, the only method of getting the
agreement enforced was by superfiuous threats. For the rest, Amir Khusrau’s
ornamentation may be ignored; such logical language would not be used even
in the inter-university negotiations of to-day; and the Rai’s ambassadors, with
their eloquent Hindi, could not have used the logical terms put into their
mouths.

2 The Persian word ‘ jauhar’, which in common parlance means a precious
stone, also means ‘substance’ in Arabian logic; the sense in which ‘jathar? is
used by Muslim scholars is the same in which ‘ substance ’, as distinguished from
‘accident’? is used by Western writers. Amir Khusrau, in this paragraph,
constantly plays on the two meanings of 'jauhar’.

° This is the famous Koh-i-Nir, which according to many later writers
(including Khafi Khan) was brought by ‘Alauddin’s army from the Deccan.
‘ Though logicians’, to put the ambassadors’ words in a different form, ‘ declare
that there is no such thing as a ‘‘ unique substance ’’, except the Divine Being, yet
the Koh-i-Nir diamond has no peer and stands in a class by itself, You cannot
find a diamond to match jt in the whole world,’

we had been advising the Rai to send a part of the jewels, that
had never been cut or divided,? to the Imperial Court. ‘ This jewel
(treasure) is unique according to the opinion of all men,’ and he
would reply, ‘Let him who wishes to cut and divide (share)
it, attempt the task. It is impossible for such a jewel (treasure)
to be divided; he who talks of doing so isin a great error”, Thus
was he accustomed to speak, but then the sword of the Imperial
officers began its lecture; the Rai understood that its stroke would
divide up those singular ‘‘ substances,’’ and has sent ail his jewels to
the Imperial muster. There is no stone left in the Rai’s treasury that
can be considered “ precious’’; nor is there any neighing creature
in his stables that can be designated a ‘‘ horse”’. As for the elephant,
it is a famous ‘‘body’’ and a large animal; if man is superior
to it in dignity, he is also smaller in size. If there had been
another “species” of the same ‘ genus,” the Rai, with the
sense he possesses, would have sent it to the muster along
with other ‘ varieties” and ‘‘ kinds’. The affair is as we have
represented. For the rest, your exalted judgment is higher, and
even wiser.’

(The Malik) saw from the propositions of their speech, that
their logic was clear of all confusion. He applied to them such
‘terms’? as had never been applied to them in ancient times, and
that, too, in a way never to be forgotten. But if any of their
premises had been wrong, the conclusion would have been drawn with
the sword. :

When the singular S2h-kashk had fixed on the Hindi a tribute that
surpassed all computation, the latter made a straight figure and put
ten ciphers beside it,? and below it he wrote promising to send
untold wealth to the treasury of the Emperor (May God preserve him
to the Day of Reckoning !). When the account of the jazia had been

Imperial sword proved that it could cut and divide everything.

? Apparently of threats. The ‘terms’ really used by Khwaja Haji were not
to be found in the ancient logic of Aristotle.

to take the roll of those who were present in, or absent from, the
army. On the 16th Shawwél, the Se/-kashk, having achieved his object,
turned his horse towards the meadows of the Capital, and guided it in
such a way that its feet went on making half-ciphers* on the ground.
This figure indicated that in comparison to the spoils he was searching
for, the untold treasures he had obtained were less than even half-a-

Arabia and Persia took up their places around it. The Afaliks, who
had been sent on the expedition from the Capital, came before the
Emperor, and after moistening the ground with the sweat of their
brows, presented the spoils. Elephants of the size of Marwa, Safa, Tur
and Bu Qabis,> horses that raised a dust (cloud) out of the sea like
western winds, and treasures under which a thousand camels would

for the people, when the pilgrims, after wandering through many
valleys, had at last reached the sacred precincts of the Imperial Court,
and their wishes, compared to which the ambitions of Hajjaj YusufS
were slavish longings, had been realized. The spectators went round
and round the Court; everyone present was allowed, without any
hindrance, to see the display and obtain the reward of his pilgrim-
age. But the reward, that could not have been obtained by the
labour of a life-time, was that the Emperor’s eyes should suddenly
fall on one with favour.

CHAPTER VI

Toe CAMPAIGN OF MA'BAR

This is an account of the conquest of Ma‘bar,; itis a river full of
pearls.t1—The blade of the Khalifa’s sword, which is the flame of the
lamp of Islam, had now illuminated all the darkness of Hindustan with
the light of its guidance. On one side, it had formed a wall of iron
before the Magog-like Tatars, so that those wretches were compelled to
draw their feet into the skirt of the Ghazni mountains, and even their
advance-arrows were unable to cross the territory of Sindh. On the
other side, so much dust had been raised from the temple of Somnath
that it dried up the bottom of the sea. On the right hand as well as on
the left, the army had conquered all land from sea to sea; even the
good news of the conquest of the two seas? (Bahrain) was brought ;
and the arrows of the state flew so far that even the territory of Kazsh*
was in danger of being captured by the Imperial officers. There were
many capitals of the Hindi deos (demons), where Satanism had prospered
from the earliest times, and where, far from the pale of Islam, the Devil
in the course of ages had hatched his eggs and had made his worship
compulsory on the followers of the idols; but now with a sincere
motive, the Emperor removed these symbols of infidelity, first from
Deogir and then from all other demon-lands, so that the light of the
Sartiat may reach their neighbourhood to dispel the contamination
of false beliefs from those places through the muazgin's call and the
establishment of prayers. God be praised for all this !

But the sea of Ma‘bar is so far from Delhi that a man travelling
with expedition can only reach it after a journey of twelve months.
The arrows of preceding Sultans had never. reached that distant land,
but the exalted ambition of the World-Conqueror induced him to test
the marksmanship of his archers, and the Muslim faith was published
in that far-off region. The general, Malik Naib Barbek ‘Izzud-daulah
(May God increase his dignity and grandeur !) was, for the honour of
Islam, despatched on the expedition with the august canopy and the
victorious troops. He was ordered through his victorious drums to
bring to the ears of the idols—‘ and they have ears with which they
do not hear ’—-the warning, ‘ that He may make it (Islam) overcome the

religions, all of them.’! Aad when the ‘water’ of the sword flows on the
coast, the sea of infidelity will be drowned in the ‘ Shar‘iat.? The obedient
officer, after accepting the command, represented: ‘ The enclosure of
the Imperial Court has been dignified by the enormous elephants of
Arangal. Ii the “Sultaénus Salatin” wishes to make the “ balance of the
state’ heavier by mountain-like elephants, there are over five hundred
of them on the coast of Ma’bar. As soon as the Imperial army
marches in that direction, the Hindt troops will scatter like leaves of
grass; and though these vermilion-coloured hills? may be removed to
another spot, it is quite possible for the Emperor’s men to overtake
them. Ifthe expedition is entrusted to me, I will pick up all these
hillocks from the land of Ma’bar and bring them in the palm of my hand
as ‘weights ”’ for the carpet of the State. I have been reflecting on
the design ever since my return from Arangal. But the exalted judg-
ment of the great Khalifa (May God increase the weight of his good
deeds!) is superior to my opinions; for he sends me to break the
bodies of the large idols rather than to capture the large bodies of the
eiephants. There can be no doubt that the scale of the Emperor’s
good deeds will be so heavy after this virtuous act that the elephants
will be mere make-weights in the balance. So taking the Emperor’s
order as a '* strong rope” to support my weak faith, ] have determined
to embark on the expedition. God helping, I will conquer the country
on the sea-coast before I allow the army to open its baggage.’ With
this faith he left the Court; and trusting in the Emperor's fortune, he
brought the good news of the conguest of treasures to the army.
The march of the army to Dhiir Samandar and Ma’ bar, like a river
hat flows towards another river 4—On Tuesday, 26th Jamadiul Akhir,
710 a.g. a fortunate moment, at about mid-day the red canopy started
for the expedition. To protect the men from the heat of the sun, the
august canopy of the ‘Shadow of God’ collected so many clouds
under itself that the sun's rays were unable to pierce through them.
First, it moved towards the bank of the Jamna, like a cloud going to
the sea, and halted at Tankal5, which it made quite red with its ruby
velvet. There the clerks of the ‘Diwau-? ‘Aris-i Mumalik began to run
their pens along the estensive river-bank to take the muster of the army,

while the A7iz-¢ wala collected his men like drops of rain under the
towering canopy. For full fourteen days, i.e., half-a-month, the
crescent standard of the Afalzkus Sharg stopped at the place and a list
of all the stars and planets was prepared. Then on the morning of the
9th Rajab, the drums began to beat for the march, and the exultation
of the Muslim army raised the dust up to the eyes of the stars.

1Owing to the multitude of horsemen, the earth looked like the
pages of the Shak Nama. You would have thought that the sky had
rained Bahmans, or that a swarm of Suhrabs and Bihzans was moving
from one territory to another. A hundred thousand Rustams appeared
on every side with their bows; some of them were so red-haired that
you could not have painted them even with the blood of Sidwash.
There were Gurgins who, with the impetuosity of Ardshir, could have
pounded a tiger with a piece of bone, and lions like Barzin, who could
have made a headstall for Rakhsh with the skin of Godurz.?

*For twenty-one days the men of the army made long marches, and
took short routes, till they arrived at Katihun. From there in seven-
teen more days they reached Ghurgatin. In these seventeen days the
Ghats were crossed. Great heights and depths were seen, in contemplat-
ing which human understanding was helpless—dzke az ant in a basin or
a hen in the sea. On the summits of the mountains the horses appeared
small like needle-points of rust on the blade of a sword; deep
in the valleys the largest camels looked like revolving particles
of dust. Kai Khusrau would have been lost with all his troops
in the depths of the clefts and the vultures of Kai Katis* would
have perished in attempting to fly above the mountains. You
could have found the egg of a Simurgh® on every mountain-top in
that wilderness. Through Divine assistance, the army passed safely
even over such a road, trampling the heights and depths under its feet.
for when a man, for the sake of his faith, carries his head on the palm of
his hands betore the enemy's sword, the blade of steel is trightened and hides

ztself under the ground. *Three great rivers were crossed, and the
army learnt good lessons in crossing them. Two of the rivers equalled
one another, but neither equalled the Narbada, A-Azndred thanks to
God, that the army was abie to cross the rivers, even as a bird flies
through the rain or the sky traverses the ocean. After the rivers,
mountains and valleys had been crossed, a present of twenty-three
elephants, huge as Elburz, arrived from the Rai of Tilang. They
could act as a Aasttb for opening the way to a besieged fort, or send a
hill fying into the air, or drag down a cloud from the hill-tops with
their trunks. Like standards fixed on mounds, they were sent as presents
to the Sultan, if he would accept them. *The victorious army took
twenty days before it could move these huge hills in that ‘ field
of resurrection ’—‘ you see the mountains, you think them to be
solid, and they shall pass away like the passing away of the
cloud.’ A roli was taken of those present in, and absent from, the
army ; and when the muster was finished, in accordance with the
Emperor's orders, the standards were carried forward, so that by their
growth and multiplicationthey might bring about the ‘ day of resurrec-
tion’ in Ma'bar. The inhabitants of that region were piven the call
of ‘ the day on which the trumpet shail be blown, so you shall come
forth in hosts ’—of ‘ the day on which a man shall fly from his brother,
and his mother and his father, and bis spouse and his sons.’ The
order—‘ lay hold on him, then puta chain on him ’—wwas executed on
rebellious necks, and the attack at which mountains pass away was
delivered on the elephants of that country. The defeated Hindis
were despatched with the sword to their brothers in the flames, so that
fire, the undeserving object of their worship, may be their proper
punishment ‘ when hell is kindled up.’

4When on the seventh day, which was Friday, the sky bathed its
blue wings in the rays of the sun and cast the carpet of light over its
shoulders, and the world was clothed in its white radiance like a Afussalmin
putting on a clean dress on Friday, the army began to move with the
swiftness of a hurricane from Ghurgatin. Wherever the accursed tree
that produced no religion was found, it was torn up by the roots ;

the conquered people looked like uprooted trees falling in the
strong current of the Jaihiin, or like straws tossed up and down and
carried forward in a whirlwind. On reaching the Tavi', they saw a
river only slightly smaller than the sea. The army crossed it quicker
than the hurricane it resembled, and afterwards employed itself in
cutting down the jungles and destroying the. gardens. Owing to the
excessive dust raised by the army, the other rivers in the land were
filled with mud like the intestines of earth-eating animals.

2 Owing to the tramping of the horses, the hills became consumptive
and wished to bury themselves in the womb of the earth, while the
dry-tempered desert became tuberculous and was covered with cracks.
On Thursday, the 13th of Ramazan, the royal canopy cast its shadow
on the capital of Deogir, which, at the command of Heaven, had been
protected by the angels; and here the army determined to collect
shooting-stars® and four-feathered arrows for overthrowing Bilal Deo
and other deos (demons). The Rai Rayan, Ram Deo, had heard safety
to Satan proclaimed by the dreadfuJ Mussalman cymbals, and
submitting to the Imperial Court, considered himself safe under
the protection promised to him. * With a true intuition, this Rai of
noble origin became the embodiment of correct judgment in
rendering honour and obedience to the orders of the Imperial Court,
in providing material of war for the army, and in advising the
conquest of Bir and Dhar Samandar. In order to please the servants
of the Emperor, this model of his generation, i.e., the Rat Rayan,
wrote a letter of homage with the pen of sincerity and adorned the
city of Deogir with the gems of paradise. He ordered all things
needed by the army to be placed in the market ; if the (Muslim)Rustams
required the feathers of Simurgh for their arrows, all possible efforts
were made to obtain them, so that every horseman of the army of Jran
and Taran> might slay a huge demon of Dhiir Samandar even as Rustam
had killed the deos of Mazindrin.® At the order of the noble Rai, who
was a tree planted by the Imperial Court, the markets of the city were
decorated like the garden of Aram, and the men of the army rode up to
them on their horses. They saw a city more beautiful than the
Paradise of Shaddad; every market was like a garden differently

planned ; the money-changers sat with bags of small and large coins,
and red and white ¢azkas lay before them like roses and many-
petalled flowers ; the cloth-merchants had every variety of cloth from
bahar-< Hind to the bawardi Khorasan, the like of which you cannot
find among the flowers of the gardens, piled up in their shops like
tulips over the mountain-top or basils in the orchard. Fruits better
_ than pomegranates and rarer than zaghz lay in heaps.

1 The material provided for the army—hard and soft goods of
wool and leather, brass and iron—was beyond all computation.
Everyone gave good money and bought things at a just price. Zhe
Turk did not oppress the Hindti and the will of the Hindit was not opposed
to the will of the Turk. As these sun-worshippers had become
worshippers of the Imperial sword, they considered the purchasers a
great good fortune for themselves and brought to the army ail that
their community could provide. The Rai Rayan had already informed
a Hindt, named Dalvi, who lay on the frontiers of Bir and Dhir
Samandar?, that the Imperial army would be at his place in a
few days; so, with his mouth open like a bucket, Dalvi sat
waiting for the army and even wished to draw the whole of Dhir
Samandar into a single bucket for the sake of the Mussalmans. ° The
army, which had already heard the message, ‘ Surely we have given to
you aclear victory ’, stopped for three days at the aforesaid fort to put
its battalions (Aazaras)into order. When the advance guard had started,*
they packed up their baggage for the holy war and the armies of heaven
and earth were with them. On Tuesday, the 17th Ramazan, the
Imperial archers and swordsmen began to move rapidly and were
. accompanied by the august canopy.> From the Azmanabad of Deogir
to the Kkarababad © of Paras Deo Dalvi, the army made five marches

and crossed three large rivers. One of them, Sini,! Had such a wide
breast that the broad sea looked like a heart pulsating in its left side ; its
breadth exceeded thirty long reeds(vaz). -Of the other, Godavari, you
might say that, in its extensive playing ground, it had carried the ball
successfully against all other rivals? The third was Bihnir with a
breast as wide as the Sini’s.7 The army also crossed several other
rivers, some roaring, others softly melodious. After five days, it
reached the stage of Bandri in the territory of Paras Deo Dalvi.*
Now Dalvi, a bucket drawn out by the Imperial officers, hoped to get
water out of Bir Dhar and Bir Pandya> and desired that with the
strong arm of the victorious army, the two Birs (wells) together with
the seas that encircle them, may be drawn into (his) single cup.®
7He had dried up in the general scarcity of water, but now seeing his
star in the ascendant and his constellation stable, he came forward to
receive the Muslim army and undertook to guide it. When the day of
Jupiter had been illuminated with the heart of the moon, the Aflalikus
Sharg sent forward swift-footed scouts in quick succession to find out
the condition of the country and made diligent inquiries on all sides.
Finally, it was discovered that the two Rais of Ma’bar had formerly
but a single will (7a7) and were as united as the two furgadaiz2.® But
the younger brother, Sundar Pandya, had from political ambition
coloured his hands in the blood of his father according to the law,
‘seize what you find’. Thereupon, the elder brother, Rai Bir Pandya,

empty, had hastened to flay his younger brother alive. Meanwhile
Bilal Deo, the Rai of Dhar Samandar, hearing that the cities were
without their Maha-rats, had marched forward to plunder the merchants
of the two cities at one swoop. At this moment, however, he heard a
sky-rending thunder of the Muslim drums behind his back.—' And
most surely our host alone shall be the victorious one’. Finding
himself in this critical situation—' They put their fingers into their
eats because of the thunder-peal, from fear of death’—Bilal Deo,
like an upturned and unlucky Saturn, marched down to his own low
constellation.

1The Malik gathered all this information with the greatest care.
Then on Sunday, the 23rd Ramazan, after consultation with the
great malzks on whom rested the responsibility of the campaign, he
selected a ¢zma2:(i.e., 10,000 men) from the officers and men of the army
and started in haste. There were archers with him who could split a
grain of poppy into a thousand fragments for the pleasure of the
spectator, and swordsmen who could cut a hill into two like a nut.?
For twelve successive days men, horses and cattle? went up hill and
down dale; the depths were such that the sky fell into fits on seeing
them, and the attempt to gaze at the heights took away the on-
looker’s breath. The carpet of thorns growing out of the rocks would
have pierced into a rhinoceros, yet in their haste the men marched
over it as over a cushion of silk. In the darkness of the night, they
waded through wide rivers, which looked like waving silk, and
through rushing torrents, which could have overturned a mountain;
and they passed, like a ship sailing through a storm, across streams
into which Noah’s deluge had subsided without rising up again,
sometimes carried on the crest of a wave, at other times enclosed
in a hollow. Through Divine assistance, most of the soldiers crossed
the land, though at the bottom of the valleys you could drink water
from the centre of the earth and at the summit you could wash your
hands with the clouds ; many difficulties were met with, but they were
all surmounted. +On Thursday, the 5th Shawwél, in that equatorial

fire-worshipping ancestors, the lamp of whose soul burned bright, have
declared that the Hindi cannot stand against the Turk, nor fire against
water. This being the case, we have no alternative but to turn
away our faces from the fiery arrows of the Turks. Nor must water
be thrown at them; for water may turn into oil and make us feel
its flame in our life-time. Therefore, I lay all idea of opposition aside.
I will go kneeling before them, like water over the earth. May be
the fire of the Turks will be somewhat appeased!’ This considerably
cooled the advocates of further struggle; they gave up all thought of
resistance and consented to open the doors of Bir (well), so that the
torches of warfare may be extinguished’.

2 When, in the morning, the ségz had brought her red wine-glass out
of the transparent goblet of the sky, the commander of the army went
round the fort, before which (the troops) of Ma’bar had been twice
defeated. He thought that the flasks by the side of the ditch® were like
a wine-table laid out. The ferocious lions and tigers (of the army)
were organized, party by party, while he posted himself along with
other Jfaliks before the gate of the fort. Noise and tumult arose from
the blood-drinking lines and the thunder of the drums resounded on
allsides. The mystic-minded sword of the Mussalmans shed so much
rebel blood that the deluge rushed to the ditch and meted out to it
the punishment its sins deserved. The heat of the flaming arrows
turned the blood of the Hindiis into water and brought it out as pers-
piration. The Council of the Afaliks wished to batter down the fort,
which stood like a demon's hat, with their maghrabi-stones, or else to
order the lancers of the army to upturn it like an empty glass with the
point of their lances; so that, surrounded by blood, the rebels may fly
out of the boiling well (47) even as a fly flies out of a flagon. But

2 Whenever the RAI was prepared to submit, his advisers incited him to
continue the struggle. ‘It would be impossible to re-establish the prestige of
their kingdom after the shock of a humiliating peace. Their power rested on the
fact that their kingdom was indigenous and as old as slamandar. True, the
probability was that the imperial troops would win, specially when the main army
came up. But, after all, death comes sooner or later, and would it not be better
to die with honour?’ The Rai did not agree. ‘To be cremated after death was
one thing ; to be burnt to death while living was another. Nor was there any
good in throwing oil over fire. Continued struggle would mean greater ruin.’
He would, therefore, make peace,

they refrained from manifesting their power for a time in order that
the negotiations may proceed. The choice of becoming Mussalmans
or gémmis (tribute-payers) was placed before the besieged; if they
accepted ‘either, well and good; if not, in obedience to Divine com-
mands, the fort was to be broken into potsherds with maghrabi-stones,
and the blood of its inmates spilled like wine poured out of a goblet.

1 Bilal Deo now found that the call to prayer would resound in his
temple and the voice of the mzazzin rise high where he, a demon, had
assumed the name of Bilal,? while the religion of Islam was extended
by propaganda and the sword. When the night of Friday, after
throwing the dark mantle of evening over its shoulders, had
emerged out of its stony pulpit, this Bilal, whose essence it was to be
a demon, despatched Gaistt Mal after the night prayer to find out the
strength and circumstances of the Muslim army. When Gaisi Mal
reached the Muslim camp, he was stupefied, just as Satan is stupefied
when he hears the Qurau read. Rows of horsemen surrounded the
fort and kept a strict watch; next morning they would commence the
struggle and enter the houses of the demons in full force to establish
the AfAuthea and prayer where the idols had been worshipped,
3 When, through the locks of the night, Gaisti Mal* saw the enormous
army spread out like the hair on a man’s head, the hair on his body
stood up like the teeth of acombinfear. He turned back likea curly
lock, and rising and falling, hastened to the fort. When he reached
the woolly Rai and told him what he had seen, the Rai came near to
losing his reason and began to dishevel his hair in mourning at his
own loss.

5 Next, the Rai taught all the charms and magic he knew to Balak
‘Deo Nayak, who was equal in Satanism to a hundred-thousand (Zakk)
demons,® and sent him to the camp of the Imperial army. This

household shadow came to offer submission before the royal canopy,
and bringing to his lips the message he carried in his heart, petitioned
for Bilal Deo’s life and livelihood: ‘ This servant, Bilal Deo, submits
to the Emperor like Laddar Deo and Ram Deo, and whatever the
Solomon of the time commands, I am ready to obey. If you desire
horses like demons, elephants like giants and other valuables, they are
present. If all this noise and tumult is for the destruction of the four
walls of this fort, they are, as they stand, no obstacle to your advance.
The fort is the fort of the Sultan; take it. The servant, Bilal Deo, has
thrown a few stones from the top of his fort; but God forbid that the
stones of a demon should do any harm to men! And what can be
better for me than to keep my stones to myself, and remain out of
harm’s way like the Hindiis of Deogir? A Hindi on being cremated
turns into a demon; but as yet the flame of the Hindi sword of the
Turks has not reached me, and it would be unwise for me to become
a demon before my time. Behold! The spirits of so many Hindi
demons are revolving in the dust round the Imperial camp. They
have thrown their lives to the wind by disobeying the demon govern-
ing Solomon, and, consequently, they are grovelling in the dust after
death. The servant, Bilal Deo, is a descendant of great Deos; but
before the Asaf-like wazst?r, who is the deputy of Solomon’s court,
he casts aside his Satanism and places his living body under the
protection of the lines of angels that stretch towards his right and
left, and, like an evil spirit in the month of Ramazan, places his neck
in the chain of captivity.’

1 The exalted minister heard the submissive message of the Raj,
His penetrating judgment discovered the reason of Bilal Deo’s
humility, but in obedience to the commands of the Muslim Caliph, he
replied: ' The order of the Caliph concerning Bilal Deo and all other
Rais is this: First I am to place before them the two negatives of
the oath of affrmation.? May be, their hearts will be illuminated!
But if Destiny has drawn a curtain before their eyes and they fail to see
the light, Iam to offer them the alternative of having the yoke of
tribute (e7mma) put on their necks. If they reject this also and
refuse to pay tribute, then I will not’place any burden on their necks
but will simply relieve their necks of the burden of their heads. Now

(tell-me) which of these three conditions pleases Rai Bilal Deo most,
so that I may consult the heads of the army and give you a reply
suited to your judgment as well as mine? Weigh your reply carefully,
even as Iweigh you. +The Rai’s messengers nearly collapsed at the
fearful ultimatum. ‘We are Hindi arrows’, they said with their
broken spirits, ‘and Hindtis are not good marksmen. May be your
message, which is straight as an arrow, will become somewhat
crooked (if we convey it). Some straightforward men_ should
be sent along with us; for a messenger despatched by your stout arm
is sure to pierce into the R&i's heart so effectively as to realize all
your wishes.’

The Afaltk welcomed the idea. He ordered some Hindi Parmar
hajibs—who, \ike Turkish arrows, were strong snakes with wings
of demons—to go along with the two or three ambassadors of the
Rai. Thanks to the powerful arm that had despatched them, the
(Imperial) messengers flew to the fort in the twinkling of an eye and
began to attack the Rai with their tongues. The Rai jumped up
from his place like a mad man on hearing their Venus-rending
voices. He wished to talk boldly, but found himself tongue-tied, and
it took some time before he was able to speak. When his fear had
somewhat abated, and his spirit, which had flown away, returned
to its abode, he stood up like an arrow with folded hands. ‘ All
property, animate and inanimate,’ he said, ‘ which Fate has placed
in the hands of this servant, Bilal, is at the service of the Imperial
court. Bilal is also one of the tribute-payers. Next morning, before
the shooting-stars and their lantern, the moon, have withdrawn, I will
present all J have tothe Muslim army. For myself I will keep nothing
except my Hindu faith and the sacred thread (zvzndr), which I wear
round my body. If a uniform yearly tribute is fixed on me, I will
gird up my loins like an arrow and meet the wishes of the Imperial
officers. By the God who has given such strength to the arrows of
the holy warriors, that they pierce the stony hearts of the gadz7s, I will
not repudiate this agreement.’ ?When the Imperial messengers
had consoled the Rai, who looked like a broken bow, and were sure
that his weaknesses could not be repaired, they retraced their steps
and came to the exalted Afalzk. The R§i’s presents, which were

suitable for the bow-string, were given over to the archers of the
army ; and the Afali&, having assured himself that the Rai was sincere
in the promise he had made, removed the knot of anger from his
brow and placed his bow comfortably on its rack.

On the morning of Friday, the 6th Shawwal, when the sky had
clothed its feet in light, the messengers of the Rai, men bad in
shooting arrows, but truthful in speech, such as Balak Deo Naik,
Main Deo, Jit Mal and some others, came out of the fort with folded
hands. They brought their presents and bowed before the Imperial
canopy, like a bow when an arrow is shot from it; next, like an arrow
springing from the bow-string, they began their alluring speech.
‘The Rai’, they said, ‘whose truthfulness is straighter than a
bow-string, assures you that in the attempt to save himself, he has
become more bent thana Hindi bow. Finding that the Turks shoot
their arrows on whichever side they see a large corner, he enrols
himself among the Imperial tributaries before they put a rope round
his neck and bring him within their power. He will submit to such
Imperial orders as are issued, and will not defend his fort with bows
and arrows.’

1 No one can describe the elephants so well as I (Khusrau), for only a
cloud can cast its shadow over a mountain. Faveryone of them was
valiant in slaying the brave, gigantic in stature, yet Jike man in
intelligence. The iron goad above its head looked like the inverted
crescent over a clond........ Hard-headed but obedient, it
bore on its back the prestige of the court. From a wide throat it
emitted a soft sound. Its hands were without fingers and its feet beat
like drums on either side. Its shanks were upright and strong like the
trunks of trees and bore the enormous weight of its body. It could
tear open the sides of a wolf as wide as laughing lips, or send infidels
to sleep in red velvet under the weight of its feet. At one throw it
could send a thief flying to the other world. The male elephant
could win their ‘heads’ from the Hindts with Chaugan-stick of its
trunk; the female could colour the nails of her hands and feet with
Mughal blood as if it was Aina * and at the same time carve out their
eyes with her nails. The soles of its feet shook the nnmoving earth, and

‘at the same time dragged the chain behind. The Sah-fash consider-
ed the acquisition of the elephants a very good omen-——that is, he
thought them magnets for drawing the iron hills of Ma‘bar towards
themselves. Officers were appointed to look after them and expenses
were allotted for their food and upkeep.

1On the day of Mars, when the wine-coloured dawn had disappeared
and the heat of the sun was falling vertically on the earth, the Rai
sent all his dust-raising horses to the Imperial stables. They came
before the august canopy, rows after rows, like the winds that strike
against the clouds; and the canopy, which has the hills for its pegs—zf
you saw it, you would think it to be the throne of Solomon floating in air—

‘threw its shade over them. The horses seemed to leap into the field of
vision out of the realm of imagination. The marine horses could
swim through the sea as if it was acup of water. Their eyes were
like crows, with black linings, and they looked at Shabdiz? with
contempt. There were dark horses with white faces, like the moon
rising up in the horizon of the night; white horses with black hoofs,
like an eclipse overshadowing the sun; horses with black patches
which reminded one of clouds scattered by the winds ; and bay horses
with red marks like the air full of roses. Their essence was from the
wind, and rain could do them no harm ; their bodies were of fire and
you could not make their effigies out of wax. They wore shoes of
iron and could, nevertheless, dance in the air. Their limbs were like
reeds, and they could not, therefore, be drowned in water. Their breasts
were wide like the foreheads of the munificent, while their ear-holes
were small like the eyes of the stingy.? Like true mystics, they
could step on air and walk over the surface of water. Barley was
permitted to them, but not whips.

* When the day of the sun5 had dawned.on the eastern horizon, the
sun-worshipping Bilal Deo saw the rays of the Muslim sword over his
head. He bowed down, ran out of his constellation (fort), and throwing
himself before the canopy of the ‘ Shadow of God’ like a trembling and
lifeless phantom, buried his head in the soil of submission. Having
thus acquired the light of good fortune, he retired to his own
constellation at a sign from the Hajib-i Malikul Hujjab in order to

bring out his gems, valuables and buried treasures. All that night
he was engaged in digging up the treasures which he had hidden
like the sun in the bosom of the night. When (next morning)
the Hindt-faced night threw the sun out of the earth, the Rai
brought all the sparkling gems, which he had hitherto kept under-
ground, in his skirt before the august canopy and entrusted them to
the officers of the Public Treasury. In this city, the four towns of
which are four months’ journey (from Delhi), the troops remained
for twelve days till the main force joined them, Then the elephants
of Dhiir Samandar were sent to the Imperial capital like eastern winds
that go to the Ka’da.

The march of the army to Ma'bar, accompanied by fortune and guided
by success.—1On Wednesday, the 18th Shawwal, the high-sounding army
drums were mounted on camel-backs for the expedition to Ma’bar
and led up and down across valleys and rivers. The ground was
extremely uneven; but the men jumped like lions across hollows which
made the camels weep, and cantered like camels over snake-holes
and rat-holes where a éa£Atz? would have sunk down to-the neck. The
sharp thorns drove their points into the feet of the camels as if they
were horses to be shod; the pointed stones tore the horses’ hoofs with
the deceptivity of a camel; the litters were torn by the rapidity of the
march and then sewn up again by the thorns. Yet the obedient army
patiently bore all the labours of the campaign. If a heavy mountain
had been laid on its back every day, it would have carried the mountain
without hesitation or protest. Every night they slept on ground more
uneven than a camel’s back.

3 Five days after the above date, the army reached the frontier of
Ma’bar. Between the territories of Dhar Samandar and Ma’bar, a

‘mountain was seen that rubbed its head against the clouds; on the
hills in front of it, there grew thorny trees, which, spear in hand, pro-
tected the garrisons that had taken refuge among them. Two passes
leading from two valleys had been opened for the fort-reducing army ;
one pass was Tarmali# and the other was Tabar. But in a moment
the mountain-rending army created a hundred passes on every side
with the shots of its arrows; and they passed through the hill as

rapidly as their arrows had passed through the rocks. At night they
reached a river avd encamped by its bank in the wilderness’. The dust
of the desert flew with the wind of Islim, and attacked the Ma’bari
troops, who were more numerous than sand-grains; their ranks were
broken like ‘scattered motes,’? or /ike particles of dust carried about by
the wind.

Account of the conquest of Mabar and the capture of elephants,
horses and jewels.2 The kindness of the Creator has bestowed sharpness
on the curved swords of the Muslim army, and they were now re-
sharpened by Him. When the army reached this land of infidelity, it
created its own arch with the strength of its arm and compelled infidel
heads to stand up and fall down before it*, The contamination of
infidelity, which the sea could not have washed off from this Jand, was
washed away by the drops’ of the sword. The rebels of that territory
had never seen Muslim horsemen even in their dreams. The cowardly®
Hindiis had designated their city Jfardi (manliness); but manliness
existed there not in reality, but only in name. The men of the city saw
disconcerting dreams and remained lost in the Devil’s game. Finally,
the Jfaliks reached the fort and carried their banners through the
city with beating drums. There was bloodshed beyond all reckoning.
The Imperial army bathed in its own perspiration and washed the
land with rebel blood.

®On Thursday, the 5th Zil Qa’d, the Muslim troops, nu-
merous as sand-grains, started from the river Kanauri towards
Birdhil. They were thirsty for Ma’bar and for the ocean; and
in case the Bir fled towards the sea, they had determined to
purste him thither like thirsty men in quest of water. When
the enthusiastic army approached Birdhil, the beats of their drums
resounded in the Bir (well); and though Bir on his part also raised a

hue and cry, yet it was a weak voice coming out of a well. The Hindi
community kept their Bir (well) covered, so that no one could look
into him. ‘ An event is going to happen’, they told Bir, ‘ your head
will be taken off and you will be left with your mouth open’. Bir
wished to sink into the earth like a well, but on further reflection, he
felt afraid that they (the Mussalmans) might throw a rope down his
throat and take out all his water. He was in this perplexity when the
army approached nearer and his fort began to shake. Bir lost all self-
control and desired to fly towards the sea; but first through sad and
melancholy sighs he sent ita message. ‘I have sailed over thee so
often. But now I, who am Bir (well), suffer from a great scarcity of
water owing to the enormous Turkish army. Give mea refuge in thine
islands.’ When these melancholy sighs reached the sea, it instantly
put on its armour and swelled up and roared its reply: ‘O Bir, do
not come this side, for in this fail of kingdoms, I will be only over-
throwing myself along with you. [ am not adry pond, in which you
can dig a well (d7r).1_ My title is ‘the sea’’ and God has given me the
privilege of surrounding the seven climes. May be, a wave from the
army of the king of land and sea—‘tand He it is who has made the
sea subservient that you may eat fresh flesh from it ’’—will come
fishing this side, and I shall be able to pay my respects to it: I am
not devoid of shame and honour, and it is for such a contingency that
I have preserved the valuables in my treasury. Very often people
have sailed over me upon a handful of wood and straw ; but now I will
change my water into dust at the feet of the Imperial troops. You
may consider me one of the meanest of Imperial servants. If Ihavea
treasure of pearls, it isa present for the Jfalzks. If there are islands
of earth in me, they are to be used for the letters of the Imperial
Diwan.2 As for the ships which sail on the surface of the water, they
cannot be concealed. The finest ships, arrayed like young damsels, are
waiting for the Emperor’s orders; he can choose whichever he likes.
Henceforth the solution of all difficulties concerning this region is in
the hands of the King of kings. The property of the servant is the
property of his master.’

When this reply came to Bir’s ears, he also roared out from his
empty heart, and in his excessive thirst and dryness, he felt like
drinking up the whole ocean. For he was like an empty well, whose
eyes have sunk to the bottom and whose interior is entirely devoid of
moisture. The officers of Bir also Jost their self-confidence ; and as
these aquatic animals were beset with a great scarcity of water, they
inevitably resolved to make Bir (well) fy by way of land.

‘When the great Brahmans saw that the Rai Rayan was weaker
than a leaf, they represented to him in coloured language that betels
should be offered to the a@wazts to induce them to sacrifice their lives.
On a hint from the Rai, betels were presented to Hindt horsemen
and pazks to induce them to shoot forth new leaves. They took the
betels and their mouths were filled with blood in mourning at their
own death. You would have said that the pale-faced and green-
coloured Hindiis were like the betel-leaf, which is green above and
yellow beneath?. Forno blood was left in their arteries, and Death had
opened its jaws to colour its teeth with their blood. They were not eat-
ing betel but drinking blood; for every time they put it in their mouths,
the leaf changed its colour under their black teeth, wept tears of blood
and caused their lips to open in laughter. Along with them, the Bir
also ate betel and drank blood’. When the holy warriors reached the
precincts of the city, their sword cast its rays on Birdhiil and made it
clear to Bir that the time of his decline was near. No water remained
inhim. From this time till sunset, the yellow-faced Rai, along with
other pale faces, kept falling into fits (safra); and their disease affected
the sun, for it also grew pale and sank down ina fit. The Rai saw
that the day of his prosperity had changed into night and the world
grew dark before his eyes. Along with his perplexed companions—
‘you may think them as one body and their hearts are disunited ’>—
he retired towards the city, from where he took a quantity of cash and
valuables, which brought some consolation to his palpitating heart, and
also a number of men and horses. Thus equipped for the flight, he
moved towards the city of Kandtr. But as the danger from the
Imperial army was extremely great, he was unable to establish

himself firmly even there and fled to the forest of elephants and
tigers.

1A body of Mussalmans had allied themselves to the broken crup-
per of the Hindtis and had violated the law: ‘Do not make the
infidels your friends as against the Mussalmans’2. But now they saw
the Rai break his own stirrup and the Day of Reckoning covered them
like a saddle-cloth. The world appeared to them contracted like the
bow of a saddle; the wave of blood rose above the saddle and they
had no place to dry their feet. So they turned away their bridles from
their infidel allies, sought safety in submission to the Mussalmans, and
tried to strengthen themselves by hanging to the saddle-straps of the
State. ‘Then surely the party of Allah are they that shall be trium-
phant.’ Though every one of them was the very worst of rebels and apos-
tates, yet they were honoured by the Malik and liberated from their
chains*; Their oath of affirmation testified to their claim of being
Mussalmans, and out of regard for this, the Muslim Malié ordered the
V-shaped yoke to be removed from their necks. The forgiveness of
the forgiving Emperor was extended to them; they were asked con-
cerning the circumstances of the infidels and brought (to light) all
they knew about those fire-worshippers. Led by these Mussalmans,
the Imperial troops resolved to chase the cowardly Bir and all other
cowards. ;

«But at this moment a black-faced cloud advanced from the direc-
tion of the Ma’bari troops, and owing to its friendliness with the sea,
strove hard for the Ma’baries. To the Mussalmans also it gave some
formal help. In fact it was very deceptive; sometimes it rained
severely, at other times gently ; on the one hand, it gave water to the
stream of Shari’at, and on the other, it assisted those aquatic animals.
At this double dealing the lightning laughed. But as Fate had
ordained that the shower of Muslim arrows was not to reach the
gabrs, the rain became more severe as the Mussalmans strove
to advance. You would have thought Destiny had drawn a curtain
before the victorious army in order to protect the flying troops. For
when the Imperialists advance like a deluge, Fate alone can save the drown-
ing. So the army returned to Birdhiil. They found that Bir (well)
had fied and the drum (dfzl) was empty. The infidel cloud, like a

Hindi in sable clothes, drew its Hindi rainbow to the full length and
sent down its rain-drops like sharp arrow-points. They passed
through the armour and the breast-plate ; and though the bronze bodies
of the holy warriors remained unaffected, they were, nevertheless,
hindered from discharging their arrows. The water rendered the
bows ineffective and made the Hindi swords rusty? ; it got in between
the arrow and its (iron) point and separated them from one another ;
it also whispered something in the ‘ ears’ of the bows and untwisted
their strings?. But the clever and masterful (Imperial) archers were
not afraid of the cloud of Bahman or of the rain-drops; their arrows
flew like lightning, for they were of the nature of the wind. Some
aquatic animals of that Jand crept like snakes into every hole and
crevice, while the bodies of others were pierced by the sharp arrows
evén as water gets into a snake-hole. The Hindi v@wats came forth
riding in troops but were laid low before the Turkish horse. A deluge
of water and blood flowed forward to plead for mercy before the Caliph’s
army. Or you might say, that owing to the extreme happiness of
infidel souls, the beverage of blood was so delicious, that every time
the cloud rained water over it, the ferocious earth drank it up with the
greatest pleasure. In spite of the great intoxicating power of this
wine the ségz poured her clear liquid out of the flagon of the sky to
increase its intoxication further. Out of this wine and beverage Death
had distilled her first delicious draught. Next you saw bones an the

morning was still far off, some swift-footed scouts reported that the
Rai, having lost all consciousness of head and foot, had fled to the
city of Kandiir. The victorious army hurried after him and soon
reached the place. The Hinditis, who relying on the strength of their
‘head’, had lost their ‘feet’ before this time, now lost their ‘head’
also, They ran about ‘headless’, searching for their lost ‘head’;
and in this search they also lost the heads they had. The ‘head-
throwing ’ Turks found no traces of the lost man anywhere, though
they cut off a number of heads under the suspicion that they were his,
and again and again drew circles round the places where they expected
him tobe. Finally, the Hindi-faced night withdrew and the morning
dawned', When the elephantine cloud had disappeared, one hundred
and twenty* cloud-like elephants were captured at the place and on
the backs of the elephants were treasures, such as do not drop from
the backs of the clouds and are not to be foundin the bowels of the
hills. The spoils were entrusted to the officers of the Treasury. Many
lephant-bodied rawafs, who like the tusks of elephants had never
rithdrawn from the battle-field, now crept into their houses like the
lephant’s eye from fear of the terrific Turkish storm; but they were,
evertheless, dragged out of their corners and thrown under the feet
{the elephants. It seemed that, smeared with the biood of those
‘\possessors of the elephants’, the elephants of that land became like
‘birds in flocks’ and carried to the elephantine clouds the words of
thankfulness to the Lord of Ka’ba.$

fishing line there’, they determined, ‘May be he wili fall into
our hands!’ So without waiting to rest or recuperate, they

started quicker than the rain that falls from above. But it was
discovered for certain from people coming from that direction that
Bir had not been anywhere near that dzraza. He had washed his
hands off the sea as well, for the sea, in spite of its stability, had fled
from that flowing river and dived to the bottom of the earth. The
forest to which Bir had fled was so thick, that there was no place in it
for an ant to put its feet; and if imagination had entered it, it would
have lost its way and never found it out again. As it was ascertained
that the Ral had penetrated into the forest even as a needle pierces
through silk, that his companions had gone with him like the
thread following the needle, and that the end of the thread was
not now to be found, the Aalzk, who, if he heard of so much
as the picture of an elephant on silk cloth, would have run his sharp
scissors towards it in the darkest night, did not consider it worth
while wasting his arrows against the hillside for such a matter of
detail as capturing the small party of the Rai. It was impossible to
find them. The Mussalmans drew away their skirts from the thorny
forest and returned to Kandir, so that with their staffs they may
explore the hills of that region in search of more elephants.

2 When in the morning the elephantine clouds had gathered round
that golden idol, the sun, news was brought that in the city of Barmat-
pur there was a golden temple, and that the Rai’s elephants had
collected round it even as clouds collect round the sun. The army
started like a storm to move those clouds and arrived there at midnight.
Two hundred and fifty elephants, who roared like thunder, were cap-
tured before dawn by the fleet-footed horsemen, zs? as the waves of the
sea are raised in a continuous succession by the wind.2 Next, the Muslim
Sah-kash came with a body of holy warriors to destroy the golden
temple in which the idols were kept. They saw a building, old and
strong as the infidelity of Satan, and enchanting like the allurements
of worldly life. You might say that it was the Paradise of Shaddad,
which after being lost, those hellites had found, or that it was the’
golden Lanka of Ram, that Rai having collected the golden heads of
the idols and left them till the time of Solomon came, or else, that they
had been lett for Bir, but Bir (well) having become dry, these idols fell

down. *In truth, the towering edifice testified to the fact that the earth
is the infidel’s paradise. It rose from the earth, a structure of
gold scratching the eyes of the stars and piercing the people of the sun.
Its summit reached the claws of the Lion; its golden foundations went
deep into the earth; you would have thought the Twelve Fish
had been consolidated into one. Its roofs and walls were inlaid with
sparkling rubies and emeralds, and after gazing at them, red and
yellow spots came before the spectator’s eye.? The sight of gold was
cooling to the sight. The green colour of the emerald would have
given prestige to a kingly crown; for it looked like a young parrot
flown from its egg in the moon. The jewelled figure of the idol
jooked like a bubble on the surface of the sun, and gazing at it would
have weakened the eye. God 6c praised that all these gems have been
brought to the Treasury of the‘ Shadow of God’!

3The foundations of this golden temple, which was the holy place
of the Hindits, were dug up with the greatest care. The ‘ Glorifiers
of God’ broke the infidel building, so that ‘spiritual birds’ came
down like pigeons from the air. The ‘ ears’ of the wall were opened by
the sound of the spade. At its call the sword also raised its ‘head’
from the scabbard; and the ‘heads’ of the Brahmans and idol-wor-
shippers came dancing from their necks to their feet at the flashes of
the sword. *The golden bricks rolled down and brought with them
the plaster of sandal-wood; the yellow gold became red with blood,
and the white sandal turned scarlet. The sword flashed where jewels
had once been sparkling ; where mire used to be created by rose-water
and musk, there was now a mud of blood and dirt; the stench of
blood was emitted by ground once fragrant with musk; the saffron-
coloured doors and walls assumed the colour of bronze, And by this
smell the men of Faith were intoxicated and the men of Intidelity ruined.

affricant,1—these, up to this time, the kick of the horse of Islam had
not attempted to break.? The Mussalmans destroyed all the dingas.
Deo Nardin fell down, and the other gods, who had fixed their seats
there, raised their feet and jumped so high, that at one leap they reached
the fort of Lanka; and in that affright the /#gas themselves would have
fled, had they any legs tostand on. And long-lived Satan, who in that
temple had induced the sons of Adam to bow down before the divgas
of the Deos, fled to Sarandip in such despair that he reached Adam’s
Foot (gadam-t-Adam) and lowered his head before it. See how far
Islam has succeeded, when even Satan bows his head betore Adam.* ‘The
foundations of the temple, which were mines of gold, were dug up, and
its jewelled walls, which were mines of precious stones, pulled down.
The spades and shovels were sharpened at the heart of the rubies; the
pick-axe, shaped like the key, opened the door of victory over the build-
ing ; and the mattock went into the inlaid wall and brought out the
pearls. Wherever there was any treasure in that desolated building,
the ground was sifted in a sieve and the treasure discovered. No part
of gold remained with the gadrs except its dust, no jewels except the
‘principle’ of fire. When the gold and jewels had been entrusted to
the Imperial officers, the successful army moved back to the (central)
camp, with its treasures and elephants.

5On Sunday, the llth Zill Qa’d, the men of the victorious army
atrived before the august canopy and rubbed their mud-smeared fore-
heads on the ground. The temples of Birdhial had raised their heads
to the drum of the sky and their foundations went down to water-
depth ; but now their foundations were dug up so thoroughly that below
every foundation a well (427) was excavated reaching down to the Fish
and the sparkling treasures, which like ducks had been roosting in
every corner of the building, were drawn out of the centre of the
earth. So much dust was raised from these Hindi houses that the
‘heart’ of Saturn became a well of dust. Two days later the towering

canopy started from here; on Thursday, the 15th Zil Qa’d, it arrived at
the city of Kim ;! five days later it reached the city of Mathra, the
dwelling place of the brother of the Rai, Sundar Pandya. The city of
the great Saturnian, who had a colossal palace, was found as empty
as the constellation of Mars. The Rai had fled along with the Ranis
and only two or three elephants had been left in the temple of Jagan-
nath. In spite of all search for the lost Arrow (Mercury) and the
Great Bear, only these two or three clouds (elephants) could be seen.
The Afalit was so inflamed with anger that he set fire to the temple of
Jagannath, .

From here the 4falzk ordered the elephants to be taken to the main
camp, and in contradiction to the proverb, that ‘ one hill does not go
to another’, these elephants were taken to the other elephants.
When the ‘ Ariz counted them at the muster, the line of elephants was
three farsanrgs long, and from farsang to farsang the ground was rub-
bed and beaten under their feet. Five hundred and twelve elephants,
who would have torn ‘ the wall of the (First) Alexander’ like a rampart
of paper, were brought into the roll of captives by the powerful
orders of the Second Alexander. Gigantic bodies they had, and if
their feet made no noise when they walked, yet the earth groaned and
cried, ‘Surely the violence of the hour is a grievous thing’.*

Praise of the elephants, with trunks like dragons, under whose feet the
kills grew soft as wax. They were like hills, so high that the vermi-
lion on their foreheads gave a red lining to the clouds, or else like
clouds so much above the ground that water took along time in falling
from their backs. Their bodies were so large that the wind striking
their backs was unable to reach their tails; and the Creator of ether
had hidden ‘fire’ in them just as lightning is hidden in the clouds.
The driver sat on their necks with his goad like the spur ofa mountain.
But while other clouds rain water and cause vegetables to grow, these
clouds drank water and ate vegetables; while other hills contain
precious stones and are permanently fixed, these hills contained no
treasures and were always on the move. veryone present wondered at
their shape—a stech hill and a man guiding it. The driver sat on its
neck like an angel directing a cloud, and the box on its back looked
like a ship floating on the sea, When it was moving, you would have

thought it a mighty wave in the ocean; when standing, it looked like
the main tower of a fort, adorned with a trunk in place of the wmunjanig.
And if the waves of the sea are moved by the force of the winds, the
elephants, when angry, moved the wind in waves ; if the tower of the
fort is surmounted by a wooden defence, this tower was adorned by a
box of jewels. You might liken it to adome on four columns, which
crushes the infidels by its weight, or to a hill on four rocks, which
causes the heretics to slip down its‘nose’...... In spite of its
weight, it moved gently like the wind ; in spite of its movement, it
seeme i to stand still.

Praise of horses whose onslaught on the field of battle destroped the
stone-stables of Time.— When the elephants had retired to their otticers, the
muster of the horses was taken. The lmperial Ariz counted them one by
ones they were five thousand in number. There were * Yamani’ and
‘ Shani’? horses, all going to their stables with alluring steps. The
‘marine’ horse coutd float like a bubble on water. They were swift as
lightning ; their qualities were those of the rose; their origin was from
the wind and yet they yielded softly to the bridle. A man could never attain
to their swiftness excepl in imagination. Their breath was like the
morning breeze blowing over the Narcissus; their cars grew like lilies.
Everyone of them was an Ahraman, who in the rapidity of his movement,
left his shadow behind. Sometimes it would siand in the air; at other
times (zis swittness) lay dormant like fire in stone. Its figure captivated
the eye and was never again forgotien. TH galloped rapidly over
wneven paths ant could see a needle in the darkness of the night; it
finished its journey as quickly as a thread gets into the eve of a needle.
When the horses, with such fine figure and qualities, had been reviewed,
they were alt assigned to the royal stables and enlisted in the service of
the Emperor, so that in the Imperial battles another wall came along
(with the wall of the elephants). May the whole globe, and even the
nine heavens, remain under the Emperors rate /

Praise of the treasures of land and sea, worthy of the exalted Solomon,
*If a description of the boxes of jewels were attempted, there is
no breast in which it could be contained, nor any heart that could
appreciate its value. There were five hundred mans of precious stones,
and every piece was equal in size to the disc of the (sinking) sun. The
diamonds were of such a colour that the sun will have to stare hard

for ages before the like of them is made in the factories of the rocks.
The pearls glistened so brilliantly that the brow of the clouds will
have to perspire for years before such pearls again reach the treasury
of the sea. For generations the mines will have to drink blood in the
stream of the sun before rubies such as these are produced. The
emeralds were of a water so fine, that if the blue sky broke itself into
fragments, none of its fragments would equal them. Every diamond
sparkled brightly ; it seemed as if it was a drop fallen from the sun.
As to the other stones, ¢hetr lustre eludes description just as water escapes
out of a small vessel.

1Through the favour of the Lord of men and jizs, and assisted by
the sincere motives of the Imam and the Caliph of the age, the orthodox
(sean) victors had now piously compelled all false houses of worship
to bow their heads on the prayer-carpet of the ground and had broken
all stone idols like the stony hearts of their worshippers. How clean
the breasts of those who broke with the greatest severity these
contaminated stones, which Satan had raised like a wall before him-
self! The hearts of the Mussalmans were now quite satisfied with the
breaking of false gods. The elephants, who had gone rubbing their
noses against the ground to the thresholds of the temples, now
considered the ruby velvet on their backs as their pilgrims’ dress for
visiting the capital of Islam, and were ready to bow their heads in
obedience to the Emperor of the Seven Climes. The treasure, which
was the mainstay and the Ke’éa of those evil men, was collected for
the Imperial court. The ceremonies of holy war, which are obligatory
duties, had been performed in obedience to the orders of the ‘ Com-
mander of the Faithful’. The Afalzk-2 Ghda2i and the holy warriors of
the victorious army bowed their heads in thankfulness—‘ Victory is
only from Allah, the Mighty and the Wise’—~and bathed the ground
with their perspiration and tears. And in their prayer for the increas-
ed power of the Caliphate, they raised their hands so high, as to reach
the Treasury of Acceptance.

Return of the victorious army to the Inperial Court of Land and Sea —
2On Sunday night the company of stars prepared to return to the
Imperial Capital. The breaking up of the camp filled all hearts
with a deep joy.2 Next morning, Sunday, the 4th Zil Hijjah, 710 a.x.

the numerous troops, accompanied by their elephants and loaded
with their heavy treasure, began their march for the capital. Victory
in all her glory Jed the van, planning further conquests; success
accompanied them in all things, and the favour of God protected
them. Fes! God will protect the army that protects the world.
Young and old rejoiced on account of the favour from Allah, The
noise of ‘ Huzza! Huz!’ rose from the infidels—‘ They are nothing
but as cattle; nay, they are straying further off from the path.’ As
the desire to kiss the ground of the Court had overpowered the
men of the army, they cheerfully underwent the hardships of the
journey. They passed rapidly and without weariness over the
mountains, the thought of which makes one feel tired, and crossed,
with the indifference of a somnambulist, deep va‘leys, the dream of
which would cause a man to jump up in his sleep. Thorns, the very
memory of which pricks one like a spear, appeared to them soft like
the hair of their own bodies. They swam through rivers, the thought
of which drowns one’s imagination ina sea of wonder, and passed
rapidly through hot wind and rain and hail, which was sometimes
gentle and sometimes severe, till they finally reached the ‘ Shadow
of God’, and were protected from sunshine and heat, pain and
sorrow, Indeed, they thanked God for the blessings of peace and for
the privilege of being able to see the Head of the State.

4On Monday, the 14th Jamadius $4ni, 711 a.a. the exalted Sun
(Sultan) held a public durbar in the Golden Palace.? The ‘ Shadow
of God’ sat under the canopy, and the rays of his face drove away
the evil eye, as if with a baton, The dormant fortunes of men
awakened ; it seemed that the black shadow of his canopy had lined
their sleepy eyes with antimony. His baton struck its light on the
head of blood-shedding Mars; his sword cast its scabbard-strap in the
neck of the sun. The sky, for all its fearless tyranny, was
overpowered by the lustre of the spears, and Time, in spite of its
overbearing strength, felt afraid of the fearful bow. The Maliks in
innumerable rows rubbed their waists together like so many rubies
and diamonds.* White and brown horses stood in magnificent files,

stamping the ground with their feet and turning it into gold. The
earth seemed full of (small) hillocks after the great JAfaliks had
rubbed their foreheads upon it, while the prostration of the 7zfadar
Rais gave it the colour of saffron. The cry of Bismillah came to
the ears of the angels and reminded them of their bowing before Adam ;
the sound of AHadakallah fell on Satan’s ears, compelling him to
bow down to Adam's descendants.1 The wind of Imperial favour
blew so generously as to take away the power of self-restraint from
the wishes of men; yet such was the awe of His Imperial Majesty,
that but for the anchor-loads on their backs, the elephants
would have fled away. When the right and left wing of the
Imperial Court had assembled, the sky recited the ‘ Ayatal Kurs?’
and the four angels read the four Owls? at the four columns. The
Emperor's servant, the Suzh-Kash, who had performed more services
than can be described, was introduced along with other Afalzks and
great men who had survived the campaign in which they had so often
risked their lives. He bowed the broad forehead of his fortune
before the throne and placed his obedient face on the carpet of the
Court. The cry of Szsmillah rose so high, that Divine favour
descended down it from the sky as down a strong rope. Then the
review of the spoils began. The ground was covered by the
large bodies of the elephants and faultless gems. While the jewels
were onthe backs of the animals, they indicated that the ' essence of
things’ was finer than the ‘eye’ ; but when they were scattered at the
feet of men and horses, it was proved that the eye was superior to
the jewels. All men, who were adorned with two eyes, just as the
eye is adorned with two ‘jewels’, wondered at the sight of elephants
and jewels. Every gigantic elephant had a female, and the female
also had a gigantic stature. The body of the elephant was strong and
large ; there was a great distance between its head and feet, and the
distance between its trunk and tail was greater still; nor could you
see the whole of its back and breast except in three views (from three
différent points). The forgiving Emperor thanked the merciful God,

1 As we learn from /én-2 Batufa, the official ery of the Aajibs was Bismillah
{in the name of Allah) whenever a Mussalman was granted audience; but when
a Hindu was introduced, they cried ‘ Hadakaliak’ (May Allah lead thee
asight !).

who gives and takes away life, for the acquisition of those valuables;
and the circumference of the sky was not extensive enough to contain .
his gratitude. And it will not be strange, if, in return for his
thankfulness, al] the creatures of the broad world are conquered by
his sword, for gratitude to God is the condition of all great success,

A few words of apology tor the innumerable mistakes and defects of
this book},.—By the favour of the Creator this ‘book of victories’
ornamented with the great deeds of Abt] Muzaffar Muhammad Shah
Sultan, has been brought toan end. Itis aspecimen of Khusrau’s
prose. May this account of some of the victories of this conqueror
wander all over the world through the realm of day and night till the
Day of Resurrection! My reason for making the book short, and
contenting myself with the description of a few victories only, is this:
Since the Imperial orders are being issued for the conquest of the
whole globe, there is no doubt that victory will carry these commands
to every part of the world from east to west. It was easier for
me (under the :circumstances) to adorn my book with a few
gems only to illustrate these victories. So from necessity, I have
described a part of the Emperor’s virtues and a few of his conquests ;
and in words that may fully and correctly express my meaning, Ihave
written a few pages. Nor did I wish that verses in any language,
other than Persian and Arabic, should blacken the lip of my pen and
the pages of my book. It is certain that the few sentences I have
composed are more meaningless than the two-lettered words that are
taught to children; that the pages of my book are more weakly
joined together than pieces of paper, which it is attempted to stick
together with the water of the mouth; and that the ideas I have
expressed, though in my opinion fine as hair, are (in reality) no better
than aletter written with a hair sticking to the point of the pen. But
since I have appealed to Divine assistance in the composition of this
book, I hope my inventions will find acceptance in the Sultan’s eyes.

Prayers to God tor the acceptance of this book (by the Sultan) and
for his forgiveness.?- May God who has cast the light of guidance on
the hearts of the Mussalmans, procure this description of political
events, which is founded on the‘ Opening Chapter’ and verses in

support of the Muslim Faith, a good fortune before the last
‘ Commander of the Faithful’, Muhammad, on whose forehead shines
the verse, ‘ Surely we have made you a ruler in the land’. If my pen in
its wanderings has ever passed beyond the bounds of respect, and in
its ignorance and forgetfulness has said anything not worthy of the
Royal Protector of the Faith, may the Lord send this verse from His
Book to the Sultan’s inspired heart—‘and those who restrain their |
anger and pardon men’—so that in his mercy to al] men, he may spare
my life also. Ifthere is anything defective in my composition, on
which men of wit and learning can place their fingers, send me a ray
of Thy favour, so that these defects may remain concealed. Lest
from the obvious or hidden meaning of my words any conclusion is
drawn against the ‘Mother of Books’, I finish my treatise with the
sentence—‘ There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is His
Prophet’, And my last prayer is: ‘Make me die a Mussalman and
join me with the good.’ 'O Lord! Send Thy blessings on Thy creature
and Thy messenger, the unlettered Prophet, and on his Family and
his Companions, the innocent and the pure, out of Thy mercy, Thou
who art the most Merciful of all.’

APPENDIX A

Tue DecCAN EXPEDITIONS

1. THE DAWAL RANI

Sucr was his fottune, that even at the time when he was an amir, he became
aSolomon in the country of Deogir (Demon-land). Thedemon (deo) became so
stibmissive in the land of Jamshed, that Ram Deo’s country was ravaged and the
Rai himself was first captured and then set free. Fate placed in Alauddin’s hands
a world of treasure, nay, the treasure of the whole world—innumerable elephants
and more precious stones than could be carried bya hundred camels, . . .

Next, the army of the Emperor was ordered to march towards Tilang. The
Rai of Tilang, a ruler over the world of gold-leaf, possessed a hundred elephants.
He wished to raise a tumult with his world-conquering heart, but the prestige of
the Emperor overawed him; and as he had net courage enough to resort to
dagger-thrusts, he sought refuge in his unlucky fort, The fort was encircled by the
Imperial army even asa demon might have been surrounded by Jamshed’s
soldiers. The Rai saw himself wounded by the talons of the Emperor’s good
fortune ; he asked for the right hand of peace and it was extended tohim. The
Rai then constructed a golden image of himself with a golden cord round its neck
and sent it tothe Imperial army with one hundred elephants and a treasure beyond
allreckoning. In return for this the 4/a/zé spared the Rai’s life ; yet in order to test
him—and an arrow is not kept blunt except on purpose—he thundered in rage: ‘If
the Rai does not come in person, we Shalitake up the dagger in the hand of peace
we have extended to him.’ When the Rai’s neck heard this, it felt like rolling it-
selfon its head (to the A/alzk’s presence) ; so before he could be brought ont by
compulsion, the Rai came outin person with his head still on his neck. This dis-
play of submission saved his rebellious neck from the decapitating sword and
he was allowed to reign in his own territory. Having been deprived of all his
wealth, Saturn was left in his empty constellation, After thus suppressing the
rebels, the victorious army returned to the Court; it was distinguished by royal
favours and even ordinary horsemen were raised to the status of respectable
amirs.

Nest, the Bardeé was ordered to make the elephants of Ma’bar the morsel of
his falcons, so that the heroes of the army may be intoxicated with Ma’bari blood.
He was to conquer the seacoast till Lanka (Ceylon) with his sword; the land
tight up to Sarandip (Ceylon) was to be perfumed with the amber of faith and
the heads of Satan’s followers knocked down in quick succession at Adam’s feet,
Accompanied by Victory herself, the army started with the intention of raising
from the sea a dust that would rise up tothe moon, When it reached the territory of
the Rai Rayan, the ground became invisible under the feet of the quadrupeds, but
as Deogir was already submissive, the army moved against the other Deos while
the earth trembled underits feet. Here, too, was a famous Rai, Bilal Deo a per-
son of great reputation in those days who through the strength of his elephants
and his treasure had often done considerable harm to Deogir. At a hint (from
the J/alsk) the army began to plunder the country. But the wise Rai refused to

fight; he came fearlessly out of his fort and handed over i
ght; i ver to the Imperial
with all elephants, horses and valuables he possessed. . “™

After this fortunate victory an the way, the army provide! itself with the
necessary material of war and moved bke awall of iron towards the ocean, It
raised such a storm that stones few sbout like straws, ships were wrecked In the
sen and the villages and towns situated on the Hae of march shook from seacoast
tosencenst. In that viciodty also there was an august Rat, a Brahman named Bir
Pandya, the finest gem dn the crown of the Hindus, His sway was unchallenged
over Innd and sea, and there were many intund cities and harbours in his
domintous, the ehlefof them being Patan, where the Rai resided, and Marhat
Puri which contained a famous idol and temple. Tne polden temple raised its
head tothe moon and Satura felt arhamed of ft; the idol was drowned in rubles
nud precious stone?, everyone of which was valusble enouph to provide food
for awholo city. The Raf possested a farge army and countless boats; Mussal-
minns ss well a Hindus were in bis servae. He had a thousand elephants and
borres more than could be counted, When the Imperial army reachedt Patan, the
ratepulded Rat forrot tis path tn fear, ania spite of Ure streagth he poseeseed,

sides, and his elephants and teoops went about searching for their lost thead’,
As amy becones a men mob when his leider is sotto be found-—-what ts the use of

‘Alauddin 1, :he povctnorof Karra, marched out of that place to Bhilsan with

mons spoils that I wit, together with dues of which Lam postponing the payment,

notreethat ‘Alauddin was so worried by his wife and mother-in-Jaw that he
wanted to couquer some distant territory where Re might settle permanently

15

114

‘without returning home. He allowed ‘ Alauddin to postpone the payment of the
revenues due and to increase his army. The Istter returned to his governorship
with his object achieved.

‘Alauddin’s feelings had been embittered against his mother-in-law, the Mala-
ka-i Jahan, while the disobedience of his wife, the Suitan’s danghter, had made
him sick of life. Fear of the Malaka-i Jahan, who hada great influence with the
Sultan, as well as the dignity of the Sultan himself, prevented ‘Alauddin from
complaining of his wife’s disobedience to Jalaluddin ; and fear of public disgrace
prevented him from speaking of his troubles to anyone else. He passed his days
in sorrow and distress and often consulted his friends at Karra about his plan of
going out into the world to win a position for himself.

With the dues (fawazil) remitted to him by the Sultan and the income of his
own governorship (madsud) ‘Alauddin fitted out three or four thousand foot-soldiers
{payaks) with whom he set out from Karra on an expedition to Deogir. Publicly,
however, he gave ont that he was going to plunder Chanderi and kept his plans
abont Deogir secret. He appointed as his deputy (s#a76) for Karra and Oudh my
uncle Alaul Mulk, one of his chief associates. He marched by stages to Elichpur
and thence to Ghati Lajura. Here all intelligence of him was lost. But Alaul
Mutk kept on sending the Sultan regular reports from Karra. These contained
vague statements that ‘Alauddin was busy in chastising and plundering rebels, and
that he would send his own reports in a day ortwo, The Sultan, who had brought
up ‘Alauddin (as ason), suspected noevil. But discerning men in the City and the
Court concluded from ‘Alauddin’s continued absence, that he had gone out to
seek his fortune in a distant land. This news, born of guess-work, soon spread
among the people.

When ‘Alauddin arrived at Ghati Lajura, the army of Ram Deo under the
command of hisson, had gone on a distant expedition. The people of Deogir
had never heard of Islam before this time, for the land of tbe Mahrattas had
never been invaded by any (Muslim) king, 4/an or malik. And yet Deogir con-
tained an enormous quantity of gold, silver, jewels, pearls and other valuables.
When Ram Deo heard of the approach of the Muslim army, he collected together
such troops as he could and sent them under one of his ranas to Ghati Lajura, It
was defeated by ‘Alauddin, who entered Deogir. On the first day he captured
thirty elephants and several thousand horses. Ram Deo then came and offered
his submission, ‘Alauddin brought with him such enormous quantities of gold and
silver, jewels and pearls, that though more than two generations have passed
since then and much has been spent in every reign at the devolution of the Crown,
a large part of those elephants, jewels, pearls and other goods is still left in the
Treasury of Delhi.

® e *

I have referred to the consolidation of ‘Alanuddin's government and his
freedom from administrative ansieties in order (to show) that when at last his
power was permanently established and his mind relieved from the dangers that
had beset him on every side, when the fort of Siri had been built and the town of
Siri inhabited, the Sultan applied himself to schemes of conquest. Apart from
the army which he had stationed on the route of the Mughal invasions, he organ-
ized a second army to overpower the vais and zamindays of foreign lands and seize
the elephants and treasures of the Deccan.

In the first expedition the Afalik Naib Kafur Hazardinari was sent to -Deogir
with the amirs and maliks and the red canopy. Khwaja Haji, the A‘até
‘Arz i Mwnalik, was also sent with him to look after the administration of the army
and the collection of elephants and treasures, No army had been sent from Delhi to
Deogir since the time ‘Alauddin had invaded it as a mere smadié; consequently,.


--- Page 160 ---
115

Ram Deo had rebelled and refrained from sending any tribute for years. The
Malik Nath roached Deogir with a well-drilled army, phindered the territory
and captured Ram Deo and his cons together with the Rat's treasury and seven-
teen elephants. Great spolls fell into the hands of the troops, A message of
victory was sent from Deogir to Delhi; it was rend fromthe top of the pulpits,
and dnims were beaten in joy. The Alan’ Netb returned to Delb! with Ram
Deo and the spails, and pretented them before the thrane. The Sultan trented
Ram Deo with great favour and presented him with the preen canopy along with
she de of Aah Aaya. THe was Curther given a fac of fankas and sent back with
frreat honour to Deorir with his sons, family and followers, Deogir wae recon-
ferred on him, Theneeforth to the end of his life, Ram Deo always obeyed the
Sultan; ho passed his remaining days in loyal obedience, never wavered from
* Alsuddin's orders and sent regular tribate to Delhi.

Next year, dn av. 700 ‘Alanddin sent the Afalit; Neth to Arangal with the
mrali£s, anurs and a large army accompanied by the red canopy. ‘Sacrifice
your treasure, elephants and horres in capturing the fort of Arangal,’ the
Soltan directed hun, ‘and try to make up for the loss in future years, Be
avick and donot persist in exacting too much, Do not insist on Laddar Deo's

silver, do not be harsh im collect: the fifth. Tf the amirs ask you to leave

in battle, or stolen by a thief, or ds otherwise disabled, give him from the royal
stable a hore equally good cr better; and ask the Khwaja to note down the loss
ot destruction of cvery horse in the Drrean-? sirz, for such a record is neces-
sary foc the purposes of the government,’

The Uahth Naib and Khwaja Haji took leave of the Sultan and went to Rabri,
atown inthe territory of the Malik Naib, where they collected the troops. Then
by continuous marches they moved.tawards Deogir and Arangal. At Chanderi
the mafi£s and amirs of Hindustan joined them with their horse and foot, and a
muster of the army was held. The fat Aayan, Ram Deo, came to the frontler of
Deovir to receive the army of Islami with innumerable presents for the J/falik Nat
and the malfés and amirs, While the army was marching across his kingdom,
Ram Deo came aud Idssed the ground before the red canopy every day, and when
fLencamped in the suburbs of Deogir, he performed all the duties of a loyal chief.
He provided fodder for the Afaltk Nai and the officers, and supplied the
royal (Suifani) factories the material they required. Every day he came with
his sugaddams to pay homage to the red canopy. He sent the shopkeepers of
Deogir to the army and ordered them to supply everything to the soldiers at
a cheap rate. After staying: for a few days In the suburbs of Deogir, the
army prepared to move. Ram Deo hastily sent his own men with his order


--- Page 161 ---
116

to’ all the towns on the route to Tilang: ‘At all the stages in the Deogir
territory up to the frontier of Arangal, they were to keep corn, fodder and all
other necessary things in readiness; they were to obey the Afalik Naié like the
people of Delhi, and would be held responsible if a piece of rope was lost ; they
were to allow stragglers to pass through their land and look after them till they
reached the army.’ He further ordered several Mahratta horsemen and footmen
to accompany the army, while he himself went with the Afalik Naib for several
stages and then took leave and returned. The wise and experienced men of the
army appreciated Ram Deo’s loyal obedience and sincerity. ‘' Putting noblemen
of noble birth at the head of affairs’, they said, ‘ bears such fruits as we see in
Ram Deo.’

When the Afali# Naib reached the frontier of Tilang, he discovered that the
towns and villages on his way had been laid waste, Seeing the superiority of the
army of Islam, the rats and sngaddams had abandoned their own forts and fled
for refuge to the fort of Arangal. The mud-fort of Arangal was very extensive
and all the veterans of that region had collected there, while the Rai with his
mugaddams, vais and relatives had crept into the inner fort of stone with their
elephants and treasures. The J/alzk Naib sat down to invest the mud-fort. Every
day a fierce battle took place between the besiegers and the besieged ; maghrabi—
stones were shot; and blows were inflicted and received by both parties. After
a few days had been spent io this manner, the adventurous and desperate men of
the army of Islam planted their scaling ladders and threw up their ropes ; then like
birds, they few up to the towers of the fort, the mud of which was harder than
stone, and with the blows of their sword, arrow, spear and axe, overpowered the
defenders and made themselves masters of the mud-fort. To the garrison within
the stone-fort the world now appeared smaller than the eye of an ant. Laddar
Deo realized that all was lost and that his stone-fort was in imminent danger. He
sent distinguished Brahmans and ambassadors (éasiths) to the Afalik Naib and
asked for terms, promising to give up all the treasure, elephants, horses, jewels
and other valuables which he possessed, and to send every year a certain amount
of money and a number of elephants to the royal Treasury and stables of Delhi,
The A/alik Naib gave him terms and refrained from capturing the stone-fort. He
tock from the Aai the treasure which he (and his ancestors) had been ac-
cumulating for years—one hundred elephants, seven thousand horses, a large
quantity of jewels and other valuables, anda deed promising money and
elephants for future years. ‘Towards the beginning of the year a.H. 710, the
Afaiik Naibé turned back from Arangal with his spoils and returned to
Delhi by the same route through Deogir, Dhar and Jhaiun. His message of
victory had reached the Sultan before him ; it was read from the top of the pulpits,
and drums were beaten in joy. When the A/alik Naibé returned ‘Alauddin
granted him an audience on the Chautre-i Sultani, in the open country
before the Badaun Gate. The gold, jewel, elephants, horses and other valuables
brought by the A/alik Naib were reviewed by the Sultan, while the people of
Delhi enjoyed the display.

It was the Sultan’s habit, whenever he sent an army from Delhi,
to establish posts from Tilpat, which is the first Stage, to the army-camp or
so far as they could be established. At every stage relays of fast horses were
stationed, while runners (d/awas) sat at every half or quarter sarok throughout
the way. Moreover, in every town on the Way, aS well as in the villages where
fast horses were stationed, officers and report-writers (kaifiat-nawis) were
appointed. Thus every day, or every second or third day, news of the army was
brought to the Sultan and the news of the Sultan’s safety carried to the troops.
Consequently, no false rumours could circulate in the City or in the army camp,


--- Page 162 ---
117

This interchange of news was a great benefit to the country. On this occasion,
however, while the J/al#k Naib was besieging the mud-fort of Arangal, some
posts in the way were disestablished as the passage across Tilang was extremely
dangerous, and for more than forty days no news of the army came to the
Sultan. ‘Alauddin became very anxious, while the leading men of the City
began to suspect that some misfortune had overtaken the army or an
insurrection had broken out. On one of these anxious days, the Sultan
sent Malik Qara Beg and Qazi Mughisuddin of Biana to Shaikh Nizamnddin.
'Give my respects to the Shaikh,’ he said, ‘and tell him that the non-
arrival of any intelligence from the army has made me ansious. He is more
concerned for the glory of Islam than I am; if his spiritual insight has revealed
anything about the army to him, let him send the newstome. Let me know
everything you hear from the lips of the Shaikh, without any additions or deduc-
tions.’ The two messengers went to the Shaikh, who after hearing the royal
message, informed them of Sultan’s victory and triumph. ‘But what is this
victory 2? he added. ‘I expect victories greater still.’ The Malik and the Qazi
hastened back rejoicing to the Sultan and told him all they had heard. ‘Alauddin
was extremely pleased on hearing the Shaikh’s reply ; he felt certain that Arangal
had been conquered and his wishes realized. He took out his handkerchief
and tied a knot inacorner, ‘I take the Shaikh’s reply fora good omen,’ he
said, ‘ vain words do not come to his lips. Arangal has been conquered and I may
expect further victories.” As destiny would have it, runvers bringing the message
of victory from the Afalik Naib came on that very day before the cukr prayer.
The message was read from the top of the pulpits on Friday, drums were beaten
and rejoicings were held in the City. The Sultan’s faith in the Shaikh’s spiritual
power increased ; though he never personally met the Shaikh, yet throughout
his life no words at which the Shaikh could be displeased ever came to
his lips. The Shaikh’s enemies and rivals told him everything about the
Shaikh’s munificence, of the large crowds that frequented his house, of his meals
and his liberality, but though he was jealous by nature, ‘ Alauddin never paid
any attention to their reports. During the later years of his reign, he developed
a great faith in the Shaikh. But the two never met.

Towards the end of the year a.n.710 ‘Alauddin again sent the Malik Naib
with a disciplined army to Dhur Samandar and Ma’bar, The Malik Naté and
Khwaja Haji took leave of the Sultan at Delhi and proceeded to Rabri, where the
army was collected. Then they moved on by stagesto Deogir. Ram Deo had
died. Continuous marches from Deogir brought the Jfalzé Nazé to the frontier of
Dhur Samandar. Bilai, the Rai of Dhur Samardar, fell into the hands of the
Muslim army in the first attack (?} Dhur Samandar was captured along with the
treasure it contained and thrity-six elephants. A message of victory was received
in Dethi.

From Dhur Samandar, the Afalik Nath proceeded to Ma’bar. Ma’bar was
captured without resistance; its golden temple was destroyed and the golden
idols, which had for generations past been worshipped by the Hindus of the place,
were broken. All the spoils of the temple—the gold from the broken idols and stones
precions beyond description—were brought to the army chest. There were two
fais in Ma'bar. From both of them the Afaitk Naté took away their elephants
and treasnres. Then, having sent his message of victory before himself, he turned
back victorious and triumphant. In the beginning of the year a.H. 711 he
reached Delhi with six hundred and twelve elephants, twenty thousand horses,
ninety-sis thousand mans of gold, and many chests of jewels and pearls. On
this occasion the A/ali& Naié presented the spoils to the Sultan at different
times in the Koskak-¢ Sirf, while the Sultan gave away half, one, two and


--- Page 163 ---
118

even four sans of gold as present to various maliks and amirs, The old men
of Delhi declared with one voice: ‘No one remembers, nor has it been ;
recorded in any of the histories of Delhi, that such spoils, elephants aud
treasures have in any age or generation been brought to the City as after the
capture of Ma’bar and Dhur Samandar.’ At the end of the same year twenty
elephants reached Delhi with a letter from Laddar Deo, the Rai of Tilang. ‘I
hold in readiness,’ the Rai wrote to the Sultan, ‘the money which I promised
before the royal red canopy, and concerning which I have given a deed to the
Malik Naib. Yt allowed, I will hand over the money at Deogir to anyone com-
missioned to receive it. I wish to carry out the obligations of my treaty and
compact.’

Wl. FERISHTA

Alarge army had once before been sent to Arangal by way of Bengal, but
unable to effect anything, it had returned dilapidated and ruined. In the year
aa. 709 the Emperor sent the Afalik Naib with an enormous army on a second
expedition to Arangal, but this time by way of Deogir. ‘If Laddar Deo, the
rier of Arangal,’ such were ‘Alauddin’s directions, ‘gives up his treasure,
jewels and elephants, and promises to pay an yearly tribute, rest content with it
and do not try to conquer the fort of Arangal or the territory of Tilang. Consult
Khwaja Hajiin the direction of affairs, Do not put the amtys to task for small
offences. If a trooper’s horse is killed in battle, stolen by a thief or otherwise
disabled, give him a better one in its place.’ The Jfaltk Naié and Khwaja Haji
reached Deogir by continuous marches. Ram Deo came out to receive them
with many presents and wonderfully fulfilled all the duties of a host. He sent
the shopkeepers of his own army to the Afalik Naib's troops and directed them to
sell their wares at the Imperial tariff-rates. He personally came to pay his
respects before the red canopy every day. When the Jfalzk Naié started from
Deogir for Tilang, Ram Deo accompanied him for a few stages; then leaving a
part of his horse and foot with the Afali& Naté to keep guard over the army and
show the way to Tilang, he returned with (the Afalzzk Natb’s) permission.
Moreover, he ordered the merchants, raiyafs and corn-dealers of his kingdom to
continue their duty of carrying grain and all other necessaries to the army and to
see to it that the (Delhi) troops were not put to trouble on any account. When
the Afaltk Naié reached the pargana of Indore on the frontier of Tilang, he
ordered his troops to kill and plunder without stint. A terror surpassing all
description took possession of the inhabitants, and the vais of the surrounding
country collected round Laddar Deo from fear of the Muslim army. When
the invaders approached, Ladder Deo took refuge in the inner fort of Arangal,
which was of stone while the other va7s remained in the very extensive outer fort
of mud. The Afalzk Naid invested the fort and closed all exits; but the infidels
raised the banner of defence and a great number of men fell every day. After a
Jong time and with great effort, the outer fort was at last conquered and most of
the vais and zamindars were captured with their women, children, families and
tribes. Laddar Deo was now helpless. He offered three hundred elephants,
seven thousand horses, plenty of jewels and cash, and promised to pay an yearly
tribute. The Afalik Naib (accepted it) and prepared toreturn. When the news
reached the Emperor, drums were beaten in Delhi, the message of victory
was read from the pulpits and all the ceremonies of thanks-giving were duly
performed. On the Malik Naib’s arrival, ‘Alauddin came out of the City and
sat on the Chabutra-i Nasiri near the Badaun Gate, where the Afalik Nath pre-
sented his spoils and became the object of unprecedented royal favours,


--- Page 164 ---
119

It is said that whenever ‘Alauddin sent his army in any direction, posts (dak
chaukis) called 6am in the language of former times, were stationed from
Delhi to the camp of the army. Two swift-running footmen, known in Hind as
patks, were placed at every éavoh and clerks (navisandas) were stationed at every
city and town on the route to despatch a daily written report on the events of the
place. Now, while the Jfalik Naib was besieging the fort of Arangal, the roads
became dangerous owing to the large number of Telangi soldiers and the posts
weresweptaway. Forsome days no news of the army arrived. The Emperor was
perplexed and seht Qazi Mughisuddin of Biana and Malik Qara Beg to Shaikh
Nizamuddin Aulia, ‘Give my respects to the Shaikh,’ he said, ‘and tell him
that my mind is weighed down by the non-arrival of any news from tha army.
He has even a greater concern for Islam than I have and if he has come to know
anything about it through the revelations of the inner light, request him to give
me some hints. And tell me exactly whatever comes to Shaikh’s lips in answer to
this, without adding or subtracting anything.’ When the two messengers reached
the Shaikh and conveyed their message, the Shaikh referred to an emperor of the
past and related the story of his conquests; in the course of conversation he
remarked that he (the Shaikh) expected other victories in addition to the conquest
of Arangal. ‘Alauddin was extremely pleased and felt sure that Arangal had been
conquered. As providence would have it, that very afternoon messengers brought
the message of victory from Arangal. The Emperor’s faith in the Shaikh
increased; though ‘Alauddin never evinced any desire to see the Shaikh
personally, yet by the despatch of messengers and letters he gave evidence of his
sincerity and friendship and invoked the Shaikh’s blessing.

‘Alauddin had conquered all forts from the frontiers of Sindh and Kabul to the
border of Bengal, and also the forts of Gujrat and the Deccan; the hereditary
dominions of the rajahs had come into his hands; and there were not ten d/gfas
of land in the inhabited parts of Hindustan where his ¢2uiba was not read. He
now began to aspire for the coast of the Sea of ‘Umman (Indian Ocean) and the
remotest corners of thesouth. The Jfalik Naié and Khwaja Haji were despatched
in a.H. 710 to subjugate Dhur Samandar and Ma’bar. The temples of those
lands were full of gold and precious jewels and their rats bad a great reputation
for the wealth of their treasuries. When the two generals reached Deogir, they
found that Ram Deo was dead and had been succeeded by his son. Not reposing
the same trust in the loyalty of the son as they had in the loyalty of the father,
they left an officer of their own near the town of Jallahpur on the bank of the
Ganges (Godavari) before proceeding further. This time they tried to slay the
infidels more than ever before, and marched on riotously till after a journey of
three months they reached the destined ports. They overpowered Bital (Bilal)

Deo, rajah of the Carnatic, plundered his country, broke the temples and seized
all idols which were set with jewels. They also built a small mosque of stone
and plaster, in which they gave the Prophet’s call for prayers and read the
Emperor’s éhutba. The mosque still exists in the suburbs of Sit Band Ramisar
and is known as the Masjid-i ‘Alai (‘Alauddin’s mosque). Itcan be seen from
there that the port of Dhur Samandar, situated on the shore of the Sea of ‘Umman
. (Arabian Sea), has now been destroyed by the innundations of the sea, It is said
that the infidels, out of respect due to a house of God, have refrained from
destroying the mosque. But, according to others, it is written in the books of
the infidels that this land, as well as the whole of the inhabited globe, will finally
come under the sway of Muslim rulers; consequently their divines have not
permitted the Hindus to destroy the mosque. Be this as it may, the A/alik Naié,
having seized the treasure of the Rai, prepared to depart. The Brahmans of the
place had been spared by the victors and were living with the army. On the


--- Page 165 ---
120

night. before its departure, some of them took ont a part of the treasure, which
was buried under the temples; but while dividing it among themsclves, they
began to quarre] and disputed very loudly, A Mussalman, who came to know of
this, informed the Kotwal. Zhe Kotwal arrested all the Brahmans and brought
them before the J/fal:k Naib. The Brahmans, from fear of the rack and torture,
gave up all they had; they showed where the treasure lay concealed, and also
six other spots in the forest where treasures were buried. The A/alik Naib
acquired a world of wealth from those places, loaded it on elephants and
started for Ma’bar. Here, too, he broke the temples and seized the cash and
jewels, which the vais had hoarded for thousands of years. Then, loaded with
booty, he started on his return journey and reached Delhi in a.u. 711. He
presented to the Emperor before the Hazar Sutun Palace three hundred and
twelve elephants, twenty thousand horses, ninety-six thousand mans of gold, being
equivalent to about ten Aarores of /ankas, and caskets of pearls and jewels beyond
all computation. The Emperor was mightily pleased to see the treasure, before
which the ‘ dad awurd’ of Parwiz was a trifle. Contrary to his usual practice, he
opened the door of his treasury and gave five and ten mans of gold to each of his
anturs; the divines, Shaikhs and other deserving persons got a aan or half-a-ian
each while smaller people also received presents in proportion to their deserts.
The rest of the gold was melted in the Emperor’s presence and the Alai mint-mark
(auhr) was put upon it. Since silver has never been referred to in the spoils
brought by the A/alzé Naiéb from the Carnatic, it would seem that no particular value
was attached to silver in those lands and that it was not current (as a coin).
Even now most people in those parts use gold (asa circulating medium). Not to
speak of the rich, the very beggars feel ashamed of wearing silver ornaments while
most men of the middle class dine in plates of gold.

APPENDIX B

MucuHat Invasions OmiTTED By Kuusrav==Kuriuca Kuwajsa,
SALDI AND TARGHI

As I have explained in the introduction, Khusrau avoids all reference to events
that were not to ‘ Alauddin’s credit. Thus he simply ignores the two invasions
in which the Mughals invested Delhi and ‘ Alauddin’s position became precarious.
They were, probably, omitted by the Fath-i Namah also. Barni, however,
describes them in greater detail than is his habit, for the great historian had little
love for military men and their ways. I give below some extracts about the three
Mughal invasions Khusrau has ignored.

I, INVASION OF KUTLUGH KHWAJA

‘Towards the end of the same year (i.e. inthe fourth year of ‘Alauddin’s
reign), Kutlugh Khwaja, son of the accursed Zaidu, invaded Hindustan with
twenty ¢wmans of Mughals. They started from Mawaraun Nahr equipped and
ready for a great war, crossed the Sind (Indus) and by stages reached the
neighbourhood of Delhi. Since they intended to capture Delhi, they refrained
from attacking the forts on their way and did not plunder the country through
which they passed. The coming of these wretches withan army numerous as ants
and locusts spread consternation through the City. Young and old were equally
dismayed,‘for they had never been through such a crisis before. All the


--- Page 166 ---
12h

inhabitants of the neighbouring towns fied for refuge to the old fort Delhi, which
had not been repaired. The City was fearfully over-crowded ; the mosques, streets
and lanes could hardly hold the people. The price of commodities in the City rose
very high for the caravan-routes had been blocked.

‘The Sultan marched out of Dethiavith great pomp. The royal camp was
pitched at Siri, and the maézks, amirs and soldiers were summoned to Delhi from
all quarters. My uncle, ‘Alaul Mulk, Kotwal of Delhi, was one of the Sultan’s
confidential advisers, and when the Sultan left Delni, he assigned the Aarem, the
City and the Treasury to my uncle’s care.

‘Alaul Mulk, who had gone to Siri to bid the Sultan farewell, represented to
him: ‘Kings and ministers, who have governed the world in the past, have
shunned great battles in which it is not possible to foresee on which side victory will
lean or what any moment will bring forth. They have advised that wars between
equals should be avoided, for such wars are dangerous both to the king and to his
subjects. War, it is written in the wills of kings, is like the scales of a balance ;
the weight of a few coins will raise one scale and depress the other ; and everything
may in a moment be ruined beyond repair. Though a defeat is not ruinous to
monarchs in ordinary warfare and matters can be patched up again, yet kings have
been very nervous about a war between equals, in which the whole country is
played for at a single stroke ; and they have, so far as possible, averted by diplomacy
and the formation of strong leagues the mortal danger, which they were unabie to
face. This is why kings send ambassadors and envoys to each other without
hesitation,

‘Your Majesty should send in front, in order toblock the Mongol advance,
the camel-riders, who are as strong as a hundred thousand horse, while you
yourself stop here with your army and postpone fora few days an engagement with
the enemy, who is swarming like ants and locusts. Beguile them fora while, so
that we may see what they are at and how the situation develops. We can
give them battle, if thereisno other alternative left. But they are not stretching
their hands in plunder; they have collected their men together and crept into the
forts. How will their immense army, from which they do not allow ten men to be
separated, find fodder? How will they live? If a few days are spent in the
coming and going of ambassadors, we will be able to discover their intention. It
is possible that they might become tired, take to plunder and withdraw ; and then
Your Majesty can pursue them for a few stages.

‘Jam an old and tried servant,’’ Alau!] Mulk continued, ‘ I have always placed
before Your Majesty my views concerning the management of affairs and Your
Majesty has rewarded me for doing so. But the wisest course is that which Your
Majesty prefers. The judgment of the great king is superior to the judgment of
other men. I have also thought out some schemes for putting a stop to the invasions
of the Mughals and shall place them before Your Majesty at a moment of leisure,
But this time the wretches have come with an immense multitude, and though
God has given us a large and well-equipped army, yet most of our soldiers are
Hindustanis, whose lives have been passed in fighting the Hindus; they have
not encountered the Mughals before and are ignorant of their tactics and their
deceitful retreats and ambushes. If the Mughals, by some wise measure, could
be induced to retreat on this occasion, it will be possible for usto organize the
army of Delhi so efficiently that our troops will be only too glad to meet them
in future.”?

‘The Sultan commended ‘Alaul Mulk’s well-meant advice for its loyalty.
Then he summoned the great Kans and Jfaliks to his presence and addressed them
as follows: ‘ You know that ‘Alaul Mulk isa wazir anda wesir-cada, Heisa
well-wisher of mine and has been my counsellor from the time when I was a malZh.

16

122

He deserves the wizarat (ministership) by right, though owing to his corpulence
T have only given him the Kotwalshif. At this moment he has expressed some
strong views and brought forward lucid arguments to dissuade me from joining
battle with the Mughals. I wish to give him my answer in the presence of you all,
for you are the pillars of my Government,”

«¢'Alan) Mulk }” continued the Sultan, turning towards the Kotwal, ‘You are
an old and faithful servant. You lay claim tothe wizarat of the state and to
wisdom. Now hear from me, your patron and your king, the judgment that is
wise and true. ‘There is a well-known saying: ‘One cannot steal a camel and
escape in darkness.’ Neither can one retain the Empire of Delhi by following
such advice as yours—~by shunning war and seeking refuge behind the camel’s
backs. It would be unbecoming for me to avoid battle by deceit or fraud.
Contemporaries as well as posterity will laugh at my beard if I act on your advice,
specially when my enemies have marched two thousand Kavo/s from their own
country and challenged me to a combat beneath the Delhi Tower. On an
occasion like this you ask me to act like a coward, to send my camels in front,
while I sit, like a hen or a duck on her eggs, hatching schemes by which my
enemy may be subdued. To whom will I be able to show my face, if 1 acted
thus? With what manliness will I be able to go into my Aarem again? Of what
account will I remain to the people of my country? How will my bravery and
courage keep my turbulent people in obedience? Happen what may, to-morrow I
will move from here (Siri) to the plain of Kili and fight Kutlugh Khwaja and his
men till it is clear to which of us two God grants victory and success. .

'% *Alaul Muik! 1 have given you the Xoiwalshi~ of Delhi and entrusted the
City, the Aaren and the Treasury to your care. It is your duty to kiss the keys of
the Treasury and the gates and lay them before the victor, whoever he may be,
and serve him faithfully. But do you not, with all your wisdom and experience,
see that war could only have been avoided by diplomacy before the enemy had
surrounded ts. But when he comes before me with such an army, I have no
other alternative, no other plan, but straightway to knock hini down, and, at the
risk of my own life, to take the breath out of his body with the blows of my axe
and sword and spear. The household tales you tell me are of no use in the
market-place. Subtle things, which may be nicely told on the four yards of a
clean carpet at home, are inappropriate on the field of battle, where a stream of
blood has to flow from both sides. As to the plans you have thought of for
stopping the Mughal invasions, I will hear them the day after the battle is over
and I have discharged its duties. You are a learned man and the son of a learned
man. By all means tell me everything that comes to your mind concerning
this problem.’’

‘*'T am an old servant,’’ ‘Alaul Mulk replied, ‘‘ and I have never hesitated in
placing my views before Your Majesty,”’

‘You are a faithful man,’ the Sultan assured him, ‘'and I have taken your
well-meant advice in proper spirit. But the situation before us is one in which
discretion has to be thrown to the wind, and there is no course for us but to risk
our lives and offer battle, to draw our swords and fall upon the enemy.”

‘ ‘Alaul Mulk kissed the Sultan’s hands in farewell, He then returned to
Delhi and closed all entrances except the Badaun Gate. Young and old in the
City were seized with dismay and lifted up their hands in prayer.

‘Sultan ‘Alauddin marched with the army of Islam from Siri to Kili and
seamed there, Kutlugh Khwaja also came forward and encamped opposite.

eople were struck with amazement and wonder, for in no previous generation or
age had armies so large opposed each other in battle. Both armies were arrayed
in order and stood waiting for the engagement to commence, Zafar Khan, the


--- Page 168 ---
123

commander of the right wing, and his amairs drew their swords, rushed forward
and fell upon the enemy. The Mughals were unable to withstand the onslaught ;
they broke and fled and the army of Islam followed in pursuit. Zafar Khan,
the Rustam of his generation, continued the chase; with the blows of his sword
he made them fly before him, while he cut off their heads. He pursued them for
eighteen favohs. The Mughals were so frightened that they could not
distinguish their bridles from the crupper of their saddles and had not the courage
to turn back. But Ulugh Khan, who commanded the left wing and had many
amirs and a large army, did not stir from his place. He hated Zafar Khan and
would not move forward to help him.

‘Now the accursed Targhi with his ¢aan had been placed in ambush as a
reserve, His Mughals climbed the trees and discovered that no horsemen (from
the army of Delhi) were moving forward to support Zafar Khan. As soon as he
found this out, Targhi attacked Zafar Khan from behind and surrounded
him on all sides with a ring of Mughal forces. Zafar Khan was hailed with
a shower of arrows and unhorsed. But the brave hero, though on foot,
continued to fight; he took out his arrows from his quiver and brought down a
Mughal at every shot. At that moment Kuflugh Khwaja sent him a message:
**Come to me. I will take you to my father, who will raise you toa higher dignity
than the king of Delhi has done.’? But Zafar paid no attention to his offer.
Kutlugh Khwaja tried to capture him alive, but as this proved impossible, the
Mughals attacked him from all sides and he was martyred. Then they slew
his amt? s, wounded his elephants and killed the elephant-drivers.

‘The increasing darkness saved the Mughals that night. But Zafar Khan’s
attack had filled their hearts with terror ; they fled from the battle-field in the early
hours of the morning and did not pitch their tents again till they had marched thirty
karohs from Delhi. Then by marches of twenty 4arofs, and without resting at
any stage, they reached their own frontier. But they remembered Zafar Khan’s
attack for years. ‘‘It must have seen Zafar Khan,” they would say whenever their
cattle refused to drink water. An army so large never came again to give battle
in the suburbs of Delhi.’

Ferishta does not add anything substantia) to Barni’s narrative: ‘ Towards
the end of the Same year, Kutlugh Khwaja, son of Dawa Khan, came from

*Mawaraun Nahr with twenty zvmars of Mughals, i.e., 200,000 horsemen, resolved
upon the conquest of Hindustan. After crossing the river Sind (Indus), he consi-
dered the towns and villages on his route as belonging to himself and consequently
refrained from injuring them, On reaching the bank of the Jumna, he laid siege
to Delhi. Innumerable people had fied to Delbi from the ‘* New City” (Kailu-
garhi) and the surrounding towns and villages from fear of the Mughals; the
crowd was such that in the mosques, markets, streets and quarters of the City
there was no place either to sit or stand. Men were sick of the overcrowding ; the
prices of all things rose exorbitantly as the roads for bringing corn and provisions
were closed. Sultan ‘Alauddin summoned his mavlits and autrs and began to get
his army ready. Some of the amtrs, however, were against giving battle; they
urged that the army of Hindustan was weak and hinted that war was a doubtful
business, which may have either of two results. The Emperor refused to accept
their advice. ‘It does not become famous kings to shun war and battle,’’ he
replied.

‘Consequently, entrusting the safety of the City, the Aarem and the Treasury
to the Kofwal, ‘Alaul Mulk, and closing all entrances except the Badaun Gate,
‘Ajauddin marched out of Delhi with imperial pomp. He had, according to the

correct narrative, 300,000 horse and 2,700 elephants. The two armies beat their
drums and arranged their ranks on the plain of Kili. Never since the elevation of
the Muslim standard in India, had armies so large met each other in battle ; nor
have they since then till now, A.H. 1015, In short, .the Second Alesander placed
his army in order of battle. The right wing was entrusted to Hizhabrud-
din Zafar Khan, one of the greatest generals of the day, who held the
territories of the Punjab, Samanaand Multan. The left wing was assigned to the
Sultan’s brothers, Ulug Khan ard Rukn Khan, while the Emperor, with Nusrat
Khan, took charge of the centre with 12,000 young and brave horsemen and many
fierce elephants. All the imperial officers were placed in suitable positions. Zafar
Khan first attacked the ezemy lines in front of him and overthrew them with the
onslaught of his elephants and the blows of his sharp sword ; then he fell on the
lines that confronted his colleagues and broke them also. The Mughals fell dead
in heaps in the forest and plain and reduced to helplessness, they took to flight.
Zatar Khan pursued them for eighteen A4avohs. But Ulugh Khan, who com-
manded the left wing, was jealous of Zafar Khan and did not advance to support
him. Seeing that Zafar Khan had gone forward alone and that no troops were
advancing to his help, the Turkish leader of the Mugnal left, who had formed an
ambush in the way, suddenly came behind Zafar Khan and surrounded him on all
sides. They wounded his horse, but Zafar Khan, though on foot, placed the
arrows from his quiver on the ground and shot down a large number of the
enemy. Kutlugh Khwaja sent him a message: ‘‘ Come to me and I will raise you
to a position greater than you enjoy.’’? But Zafar Khan did not heed it and kept
on shooting his arrows, Kutlugh Khwaja tried to captuze him alive, but that
having proved impossible, he ordered arrows to be showered on Zafar Khan till
he was martyred, The awirs of Zafar Khan’s army were also slain. Kutlugh
Khwaja was so frightened by the Hindi attack that he did not draw his bridle till
he had marched thirty £avohs on that very day; then by continnous marches he
moved on to his own country. Zafar Khan’s courage and generalship became
proverbial among the Mughals, and if one horse refused to drink, they
would remark that it had seen Zafar Khan. The Emperor, who was afraid of
Zafar Khan, considered his martyrdom a second victory, and returned from Kili
to the City, where ke gave himself up to rejoicings and pleasures. ‘hose who had
behaved bravely in the battle were rewarded with robes of honour and promoted

in the service, but an amir, who had fied to Delhi from the camp, was paraded
through the streets of the City on an ass.’

WI. INVASION OF SALDI

; To ‘Alauddin’s dislike of Zafar Khan, we may also attribute Khusrau’s omis-
sion of another struggle with the Mughals, which took place sometime before the
invasion of Kutlugh Khwaja. ‘In the same year that Ulugh Khan and Nusrat
Khan were sent to Gujrat, Zafar Khan was despatched against Siwistac (Sehwan)

waich had been captured by Saldi and his brother and other Mughals. Zatar
Khan invested the fort of Siwistan with a large army and made a way into it with
the blows of his axe, sword, javelin and spear. No muaghribis, nanjanigs or
tradas were brought into action; no pashib or gargaj was constructed; and
though the Mughals from within shot such a shower of arrows on all sides that
even the birds of the air could not go near the fort, yet Zafar Khan captured it
with his sword and axe. Saldi and his brother and all the other Mughals with
their women and children were sent in yokes and chains to Delhi This exploit
established Zafar Khan’s prestige in the public mind and -
look askance at his generalship and fearless courage, which s
Rustam had appeared in Hindustan, ,

‘Alauddin began to
hhowed that a second
Ulugh Khan, whose achievement (the


--- Page 170 ---
125

conquest of Gujrat) had been surpassed, also concieved a hatred for Zafar Khan.
This year Zafar Khan held the territory of Samana. ‘Alauddin, who was extremely
jealous by nature, was thinking of getting rid of him in one of two ways—et/her by
showering favours on him and sending him to Lakhnauti with several thousand
horse, so that he may seize that territory and send the Sultan’s elephants and
tribute from there, or by having him poisoned or blinded,’

Ferishta adds little to the above account. He calls the Mughal leader Chaldi
and says that the Mughal captives sent to Delhi, apart from the women and
children, numbered seventeen hundred.

lt. INVASION OF TARGHI

‘No sooner had Sultan ‘Alanddin returned (from Chitor), than the Mughal
danger arose once more. The Mughals in Mawaraun Nahr heard that Sultan
‘Alauddin had gone to lay siege to a distant fort and that there were no troops in
Delhi. Targhi collected twelve Zwmans of horse and by forced marches reached
Delhi before he was expected. In the same year, when ‘Alauddin had marched
to Chitor, Malik Fakhruddin Jauna, the Dad-bek-# Hazrat and Malik Chajji,
nephew of Nusrat Khan and governor of Karra, had been sent to Arangal with the
anirs and horse and foot of Hindustan, But when they reached Arangal, it began
to rain in torrents, and harassed by the rainy season, the army of Hindustan
could achieve nothing there. Towards the beginning of the winter, it returned to
Hindustan, greatly reduced in numbers. It had lost all its baggage. The
army of Sultan ‘Alauddin had also lost its baggage at the foot of the Chitor fort
in the siege operations and the rain.

* The Sultan had not been in Delhi for a month, no muster of the troops had
been held and the saferial lost had not been replaced, when Targhi, all of
asudden, arrived with thirty or forty thousand horsemen and encamped on the
bank of the Jumna. The people of the City, therefore, found their communica-
tions with the outside world cut of. The condition of Sultan ‘Alauddin'’s army
was pathetic. The Sultan, as explained above, did not get sufficient time to replace
the horses and materia? he had lost at Chitor. Malik Fakhruddin Jauna returned
to Hindustan afterlosing his army and its »aferia/ in Warangal, and as the Mugals
had so encamped as to Close all the roads, no horse or foot from the army of Hin.
dustan could reach the City. At Multan. Depalpur and Samana there was no
force strong enough to break through the Mughal lines and join the Sultan at Siri.
The army of Hindustan was summoned, but as the Mughals had captured all the
fords, it was compelled to remain at Koil (Aligarh) and Barran (Bulandshahr).

‘Sultan ‘Alauddin, therefore, came out of the City with the few troops he had
and encamped at Siri. He laid aside all thought of open battle and dug a trench
round his camp ; on the outer side of the trench he constructed a wooden defence
of stakes made from the doors of the houses of Delhiin order to prevent the Mughals
from breaking into hiscamp. He ordered the garrison to be watchful and awake;
they were to keep an armed guard at the trenches, so that the Mughals may not
be able to cross them, and five armed elephants were made to stand in the trench
of every detachment. The Mughals swarmed round the camp and wished to
make a sudden assault on the Sultan’s army. Never before had the Mughal dan-
ger been so great in Delhi as in this year, and if Targhi had remained for another
month, there was a great likelihood that the Citizens, growing sick of the situation,
would have submitted (to him). The Mughal danger weighed heavily on all
hearts ; no water, grass or wood could be brought to the City from outside; and the
¢aravan routes of the corn merchants had been closed. The Mughal horsemen came

1 Barni Persian Text, pp. 253-4.


--- Page 171 ---
126

to the Chautra-i Subhani, Muri and Kudhi; they often alighted on the embank-
ment of the Royal (Shamsi) Tank, where they held their drinking parties, and sold
the corn and provisions of ‘Alauddin’s stores at a very cheaprate. This prevented
an excessive scarcity of corn in the City. ‘Iwo or three skirmishes took place be-
tween the mounted foraging parties of the two armies, but neither side gained a deci-
sive victory, Thank God! the accursed Targhi did not succeed in breaking into the
Sultan’s camp and annihilating his army. After two months the prayers of the
helpless (were heard by the Almighty) and Targhi collected his spoils and retired
to his own land.

‘This deliverance of the City and the army of Islam from the Mughals appeared
a strange thing to experienced men. The Mughals had come at the proper time
and in sufficient numbers to capture the City; they had closed all roads for
the entrance of soldiers and provisions ; the Sultan’s army had no equipment and
no reinforcements could reach it ; and yet the Mughals were unable to overcome
or prevail’?

Ferishta, who contents himself with summarising Barni, is pleased to add:
‘The Sultan, in his excessive anxiety, appealed to Shaikh Nizamuddin Aulia,
That very night, it is said, Targhi, who had besieged Delhi for two months, was
overpowered by a strange terror and retreated in haste—an action for which no
material reasons can be found, The people of Delhi considered it to be the
result of the Shaikh’s intervention and numbered it among his miracles.’
Targhi’s apparent success, it must not be forgotten, had been due to the rapidity
of his movements. ‘Alauddin’s defence of Siri for two months must have given the
amirs of the Doab and the Punjab time to collect their forces. It is difficult to
explain the ‘strange terror’ that took possession of Targhi’s mind, but his com-
munications were in danger and he may not have felt himself strong enough to
meet the forces which were sure, sooner or Jater, to march for the relief of Delhi

from all sides.
