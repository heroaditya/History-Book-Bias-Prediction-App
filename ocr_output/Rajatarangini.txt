, Separatep frem the rest of tho world, on the north
by the lofty range of the tHimélaya mountains, and on
other sides by the sea, Ind:a has from the earliest period
epresented to its people a world by itself. And within
this vast continent lived from the remotest antiquity
# portion of the Aryan race who developed amoung
themselves a degree of civilization unattained by avy
other nation of antiquity. This people, though origi-
nating from the*same stock, speaking the dinlects of
the same language, and following the dictates of the
same religion, had enrly divided themselves into different
tribes according to the physical nature of the portion
of tho country which they each came to ocenpy. The
K4shmitiaus and the Nepalese who inhabited the moun-
tainous regigns of the Himalayas, differed frora those who
dwelt in the valleys of the Indus or the Ganges, or
occupied the deserts of Raéjputana or the tableland of Mahé-
yashtra. Nor did the division cease here. There were
minuter sub-divisious, and the country was cut up into
small principalities and tribes, each tribe having a chief of
their own, speaking a distinct dialect, settling in a
definite tact wf country “which they generally named
after themselves. Hoven Sang, the Chinese pilgrim,
who visited India in.the 7th century after Christ, speaks
of 138 such principalities, of which 110 were personally
visited by him, These petty *tribes seem to have kept
fp a continual strife with one another, subduing and

being subdued in turn, And many were the tribes that
rose to influence from time to time, reducing their
neighbours to a state of vassalage, and styling themselves
the lords of the seagirt world. Nor were their affairs
always confined within the geographical limits of India.
They had frequent intercourse with almost all the ancient
nations. Their ships visited China and the Eastern,
Archipelago, and they were visited in turn by Arab ships
and merchants who exported Indian commodities to
Bagaad, Egypt and Europe. Foreigners also came as
invaders, avd not unfrequeutly as travellers,

Of the succession of cvants which took place among
each and all of the numerous tribes that dwelt and are still
dwelling in India from the remotest antiquity, we have
no authentic records, ‘The Ramayana, the Mahabharata
and other ponderous volumes, though giving faithf ul pic-
tures of the state of the people and their habits, feelings,
manners, &c., during the periods when those works wore
composed, yield but little information regarding historical
events. The Rémfyana furnishes us with but meagre
annals of a single line of kings who reigned in one town,
Ayodhya, and its neighbourhood ; and the greater portion
of the work is devoted to deccription of q single reign,
that of Rama, a description which outrages sober belief,
Mah 4ébhArata likewise narrates the wanderings and wars
of the five sons of Péndu, and the narration is mixed
with stories of the past me<tly of an absurd and romda-
tic kind. Such being the character of the books we now,

possess, an attempt to write a history, in its usual Sense,
of India, musteat present remain a hopeless task,
Whiles so much dearth prevails in the department of
Indian history, an account of a people who lived from
, the earliest period in a corner of India, may not, it is
hoped, be unacceptable. The present work, it should be
stated, pretends to be nothing more than a faithful render-
ing into English of a history which already exists in the
Sauskvita langnage.* The first part of the book, the
Réjataranggini,"has been written by Kahlana Pandita, sou
of Champalka. It embraces the history of the country
from tho earliest period to the time of the author, A.D.
1148, The next part entitled Rajabali has been written
by Jonaraja, and brings tho history down to A.D. 1413 ;
and this again has been continued under the name of
Jainargjatgzanggin{ by his pupil Sri Vara Pandita to A.D.
1477. The fourth and last part, the Rajavolipitaka,
brings down the history of the country to the time of its
conquest by Akbar, and was written by Prajya Bhatta at
the time of that emperor. The present translation em-
braces the history of the country from the earliest
times to the reign of king Harsha, A.D, 1101, about one-
half of the work,of Kablana Pandite, It is the intention
of the Translator -to bring down the history in two more
volumes to the period of the conquest of the vélley by

Akbar. He can, however, hold ont no promise to hia
reaers to this effect, as his time is nof always at his
comunand, n

Tt ig a matter af just rogret/ that the work is disfigured
in many placea with what in modern times would be
considered immodest writing, ‘The time of the author
perbaps allowed such writing. However that may be, all
that the Translator has to stnte for himself is that he has
not thought himself justified to improve upon his original,
ani that his only ohject throughout this- performance hag
been to offer to his renders a faithful translation of the
original, with all its beauties and defects,

Mr. Wilson has already favored the English reading
public with a sketch of a small portion (first six eantos)
of the history of Kashmira. (See Asiatic Researches,
Vol. 15.) But it is after all o sketch, and a sketch made
from very imperfect copies ; and though ifS materials
are mostly drawn from the Sanskrita work, yet it is
mixed up with the whimsical additions and alterations
which appear in the Persian translation,

In conclusion, the writer hag only to add that in his
earlier years he always cherished the idea of writing a
complete history of India from, original Sonskrita records.
Riper years shewed him the folly of sach an attempt.
His inability to undertake such a gigantic task, even if
the materials had not been wanting, should have made
him think twice before evyfertaining such a hope. Nerer-
theless the idea imbibed in younger days, “and fondly

cherished from year to year, the writer has found it diff-
cult altogether tg give up. It was for a long time” his

' wish to copnect his attempts with a history of India, and
this hope or vanity he has ‘now attempted to gratify by
the comparatively lighter ‘task of rendering a history
which already exists in the Sanskrita language into
Epglish. Even while this work was in progress, he was
too often and too painfully reminded by the difficulties
he met, of his own weakness.

The elaborate original records were epitomized by
Suvrata, in order that they might beismemberod with,
ease, and so the original was Ist. The style ‘of Suvrate
is tough and obsoure. :

Though Kshesandra had the powers of a post, yet
through his carelessness, his history of kings has become
faulty. .

I have seen eleven old works on the history of kings,
and also the book of Nilamuni, and have corrected many |
errors by examining gift-deeds of ancient kings.

Twelve thousand worka on the history of kings were
compilod by the great ascetic Helaraja.

No meution is made of fifty-two kings on account of
their irreligion. Four of these, Gonanda, &ec., are
named by Nilamuni; Padmamihira following Heldraja
gives an account of eight kings, descendants of Ashoka
from, Lava; aiid Shrichchhavillaka speaks of five ouly.
He writes, “from Ashoka to Abhimanyu five kings have
been named out of fifty-two.” These fifty-two kings,
whose histories have not been written because of their
evil works, were contemporaneous with the Kauravas
and the Kaunteyas of the “Kali Yuga.~ They reigned
with might, rode elephants, attained great prosperi-
ty, ard in their houses were ladies, hidden from view
like moon-light in the open day; yet these great
men are not now known or remembered, aa if they
had never been born, simply because poets did not favsr

Kashmira is stydded with high cliffs, and cannot le
conqnored even by the strength of a good army; and the
people are afraid of nothing but of the future world, In
winter there are hot baths by the river, in summer the
cool river-banks ; and the rivers are calm, and not infes-
ted with water avimals. It isa country where the sun
shines mildly, being the place croated by Kashayapa as
if for his ghffy. High school-houses, the saffron, ived
water, and grapes, which are rare even jn heaven, are
common hero, Kailésa is the best place in the three
worlds, HimAlaya the best part of Kailiso, and Kashrafra
the best place in Himalaya.

The following is a list of gods and holy things which
existed in K&shyaira from tife earliest time :—

Au wooden image of Shiva, the destroyer of vice, to
touch which is to gain salvation ;

A* currentof water which flows at evening over a hill.
This cau be séen by the virtuous, but not by the vicious ;

takes its rise, *

The shrine of Nandi Kshetra where the spots of san-
dal, with which the gods performed worship, are visible
to the present day.

There, at Nandi, is also Sfrada or Durga, by seeing
whom onc gains immediate salvation aud the gift of the
flowing aud sweet speech of a poet.

The country is adorned with gods Chakrabhrita,
Vijayesha, Adi Keshaya and Ishdna, Itis full of shrines,

Bo it to the glory or shame of the country or the
time, we will speak the truth, regarding the history
of kings. This book contains accounts ef many a
cient manners; and what wise men will not feel charin-
ell with it? Thé triumph of contentment will be apparent
if the frail life of man be contemplated. Listen then to
this sweet history clearly narrating tho actions of kinys.

For six Manvantaras from Sarskalpa the world lay
filled with water, bedded in tie lap of the Hintflaya, and
on the approach of the present Vaivasvatakalpa, Kashyapa
invited. the gods from above, aud struck the earth
and caused it to be henved above the water, and thus
established the kingdonf of Késhmfra. Then reigned

the serpent (Naga). Thore lived various classes of
Nagas whose jewels made the city as rich as the
treasury of"Kuvera. The frat king Nfla was invited by
the Nagas to reign over’) them. He had a aceptre
oae and a half oubit long, and had an umbrella placed
over him, and a kunda. °

- aThe history then presenta a blank till the reign of
Gonanda I. at the beginning of the Kali yuga, This
powerful king was contemporary with Yudhisthira and
a friond of his *enomy Jarésindhu. Gonanda J, who
ruled in Kfishmira, where the Ganges flows cheering the
mount Kailgan on her way, was invited by Jorésindhu
to help him in his invasion of Mathurd, the capital of
Krishna, With a largo army they invested that
city and encamped on the banks of the Yamuna to the
great terror of their foes. On one occasion the army of
Krishna was defeated in a battle, but Balaréma not only
retrieved the confusion of his army, but mnde a vigorous
attack onthe allied force. For a long time victory re-
mained doubtful, till at last Gonanda I., pierced with
wounds fell dead on the field, and the army of Krishna
was victorious.

On his death, Démodara+I. ascended the throne of
Kashmfra, and though possessed of this beautiful king-
dom, he was far from being happy; his proud heart
brooded on his fathe.’s death. While in this state, he
hed that the Gaudhdras had revited Krishna and his
relutives to the nuptials of some of the daughters of

their tribe, to be celebrated nenr the banks of tho
Indus, and in which tho bridegroeme, were to be,
chosen by the brides. Whilq great preparations were
being made for the nuptial, the king moved with a
large army of infantry and horse, aud interrupted the
fesfiyal. In the battle that ensued, many of the Gan-
dhavas were killed, but the king, pierced to the heant
with Krishne’s chakra, perished,

He left his queen Yasnbat{ pregnant, and she wags by
Krishna’s orders raised to the throne This step was
opposed by his envious ministers, but he silenced them
by repeating a verse from the Puranas, to the effect that
the girls of Kashmira are Parvvatis. ‘ Kuow,’ said he,
“that the sovereigns of Kgshmira are portions of Hara,
aid they should not be hated by the wise even if thoy
be wicked and worldly-minded. Man does not value the
woman he enjoys, but the subjects will see in her, thoir
mother and goddess.” In due course the queen gave
hirth to an auspicious male child, and it was a sapling
of a family which had well-nigh become extinet. The
ceremonies of his birth and coronation were performed
by Brahmans, and he grew up aud was named Gonanda
after his grandfather. Two nurses wera employed for
him, one, his mother, to give him mill, and the other to
do allother work. His father’s ministers would bestow
wealth ou those on whom he would smile, though the smile
of a child is meaningless If they could not understand
his lisping words they left ashamed. They would often

set him upon his father’s throne, his feet not reaching
the footstool, pad. while his hair wavod in the breeze of
the cham@ra, they would «minister justice to his subjects
in his presence. It was ai this time that the great battle
of Kuru Pandava was fought, but he was then an infant,
and wag not therefore asked to help either of the parties.
a After this, the names of thirty-five kinga are lost in
the sea of oblivion, as their history has not been writ-
ten bocause of their irreligiousness.

Tho next kisg whose name is mentioned was Lava, a
renowned prince, Ho had o vast and powerful army
under him, and probably carvied on many wars with his
neighbours, It is said of him that the noise of his
army inade.his people sleepless, but lulled his enemies to
long sleep (death). He built the town of Lolora which,
it is said, contained no Jess than cighty-four lacs of stone-
built houses. Nothing more is said of him than that he
bestowed the village of Levara in Ledari on Brahmanas
before bis death.

He was succeeded by his son Kusheshaya, who was a
powerful prince. Hs bestowed the village of Kurtihéra
on Brébmanas, :

His soy Khagendra, whe succeeded him, was a valorous .
and patient king. He destroyed many of the Nagas‘
who were his enemies. He founded the villages of
Khagikhuna and Musa. :

“After his death his son Suxendra succeeded him. Hea |

tempor. Ho built near Darat 1 town named Saura, and
within that town he erected a palace whieh he named
Narendra Bhavana. IIe died oljildless.

On his death one named Godhara, born of a different
family, became king. He gave away the village of
Hastishalé to Bréhmanas.

His son Suvarna, who reigned after him, was ac
liberal prince; he gave away gold to boggars, and
enused a canal which be called Suvarna-mani to be
dugf'at Karéla, e

Tis son Janaka was like a father to his subjects ; he
built Vihfra and Jalara.

His non Shachinara, of forgiving temper and of noble
mind, then ruled the kingdom ; he built Rajégrohdra and
Shaméngaséshanarn, He died childless.

He was succeeded by Ashoka, the great grandson of
Shakuni, and son of king Shachinara’s first cousin.
Ile was a truthfuband spotless king, and a follower of
Buddha. He caused many stupas to be built on the
rocky banks of the Vitasté (Jhelum) ot Shushkaletra.
On the extremity of Dharmdranyn he buitt a chaitya
so high that its top could not be seen. It was
he who built Srinagara, which coutnined no Jess than
ninety-six Ines of beautiful houses. He pulled down
the dilapidated wall of tho compound of the temple of
Srivijayesha and built 2 new stone wall in its stead.
He also caused to be erected two palaces near the couft-
yard of that god, oud named them Ashoka and Isvra.

Jn his reign, it appears, the Miechchhas (Soy thinns %)
pvorran the cewitry, and he retired into privacy and
onded his fife in devotion. '

His brave son Jaloka, said to have been the gift of
Shiva whom he pleased by his worship, drove back the
Mlechchhas from the country and succeeded in regaining
Ids father's throne. An account of his accomplishments,
would astonish even the gods. Ifa golden egg wore
thrown into a tank, he could pierce it with his arrow.
He knew the art*of being under water, by which device
he enjoyed the youthful danghtevs of the Nagas. Ile
wags the worshipper of* Vijayeshvarn, Nandfsha and
Kshetrajyeshtesha—all, different representations of Shiva.
His victory over these foreigners, which gained him great
reputation, did not cease with their expulsion from his
kirigdom, byt he pursued them to the sea, Weary of
battles against them, he rested at a place where he tied up
his hair, for which reason the place was named Ujjata-
dimba. He then turned his arms in another direction,
conquered Konouje, and thence carried to his kingdom,
some men of each of the four castes, who were versed in
law and religion. Before his time, Késhmira was a poor
country, aud justice was’not well administered. For
the proper administration of the country he created
seven new offices, viz, : those of Chief Justice, Chancellor
of the Bxchequer, Treasurer, Commander-in-Chief,
Ambassador, High Priest and Augur. He entrusted
the government of Dvéra and other places to his queen

Tshanadevi. He catablished eighteen places of worship,
and “built Varavala and other edifices--14 used to hear
the Nandi Purana recited by ¢ disciple of Vyasa. Le
set up the god Jeshtharudra in Srinagara, and also wor-
shipped the god Sodara.

Iis narrated of this king that one day, when he was
going to the temple of Vijayeshvara, he met ® woman in
the way who asked Lim for some food, and when he pre-
mised her whatever fuod she wanted, she changed herself
int} some doformed shape and asked for human flesh.
Unwilling to Kill any ono to satisfy her unnatural appe-
tite, he permitlod her to take off: what sho liked from his
own body. This heroic solf-devotion seemed to move her,
andl sha remarked that for his tender regard for the life
uf others she considered him a second Buddha. The
king, being a follower of Shiva, did not know Buddha,
and asked her who Buddha was whom she took him to
he, She then anfolded her mission and said, that on
the other side of the hill of Lok&loka, where the sim
never shone, there lived a tribe of Kritliké who were
the followers of Buddha. This tribe, she continued with
the eloquence of 1 missionary, were uever angry even

akatltiose who did them injury, forgave thom that
trespassed against them, and even did them good They
taught iruth and wisdom to all, and wero willing to
dispel the darkness of ignorance that covered the earth.
* But this people,” she added, you have injured. There
Bas a monastery belonging to us in which the beating of

drums onee disturbed your sloep, and incited by the
advice of wiekoa’ mon you have destroyed the monastery.

The angry Buddhists gent me to murder you, but our

high priest interfered; he told me that you were a
powerful monarch, against whom we would not be ,able
tu cope. To said that if you would listen to me, and
‘hnild a monastery with your gold, you would atone
for the sins of which you are guilly in destroying the
former one, Llere IT came therefore and tested your
heart in disguife.” Krittidevf then returned to her peo-'
ple after extorting from the king a promiso to bnild a
monastery, aud agreeably to his promise he caused it to
he erected on tho very place of their meeting. \

At Naudikshetra he caused n houso of Shiva Blyitesha'!
to bo erected aud bestowed much wealth on it. It seems
his Inst days were spent in devotion. On the banks of
the Kanakavaéhinf there was a holy place named Chita.
mochana. Tlere the king performed fis devotions for
three nights. At tho time of song and dance, one hundred,
females of his houschold rose up to dance before the god
Jeshtharudra and he bestowed those women on that
god. He and his queen died at Chframochann.

Damodara 3], then ascénded the throne ; it does not ap-
pear, whether this priuce was of Ashoka’s line or of some
uther dynasty. He was very rich, and a devout Shaiva,
aul his glory is still remembered. Le contracted friend-
ship with Kuvera, king of the Yakshas, a neighbouring

“tnibe, and caused the Yukshas to build a bridge crossing «

swamp, and gave the name of Diémodaroguda to the city
built by him in that swamp. Ambition tq do somothing,
uncommonly beneficial to his feople, he thougft of erect-
ing high stone embankments to prevent inundations,
employing the Yokshas in the work. But an accident
prevented the accomplishment of his design. One day
when the king was going to bathe pervious to performiny
a Shraddha, some hungry Brabmanas asked him for foad,
byt he disregarded their request and was proceeding to
the river, when the Bralmanas by the fofce of their wor-
ship brought the river to his feet, ‘Look f’ said they,
‘there is the Vitasté (Jhelum), now feed us.” But the
king suspected it to be the effect of magic, “Go away
for’ the present,” replied the king, “I will not feed you
til Thave bathed.” The Bréhmanas then cursed him
saying that he would ba turned into a serpent. When
much entreated to withdraw their curse, they so far miti-
gated it as to say that if the king would listen to the
Ramayana from the beginning to the end in one day,
he would again be restored to his form, To this day,
he niay be seen running about at Damodarasuda in the
form of a thirsty serpent. Cursed is the power of Rishis,
that even such a good king slfould be destroyed by it.
The glory lost by the force of om enemy may be restored
again, But that destroyed by the curse of Bralmanas ne-

. ver comes back.

Then there were on the throne of Kaghmira three

éheir names. <Jiisika also caused a monastery to be built
and another town named Jayasvémipura. Though they
woreof Turashka origin, they yet built sevoral monasteries
and places of worship on the plains of Shushkalgtra.
During their loug reigus Buddhist hermits were all-power-
fil in the conutry, ond Buddhist religion prevailed
without opposition, From the death of Buddha Shéky-
asinha to this time of Lokadhatu, one hundred agd
fifty years had passed. Négirjjuna a great Boddhisattva
then stopped for six days in the wooda of Kishmira.
Thou reigned Abhimanyu without an onemy in the
kingdom, and bestowed the village of Kantakoutsa to
Bréhmanas. He caused an image of Shiva to bo made
ou which his uame was inscribed. He also built o city
called Abbiganyupura after his name. Tt was in his
reign that tho grammarians Chandriécharjya and others
flourished, and wrote tha history of this king with his
permission, The Buddhists, under their great loader
Nagérjjuna, continued to gain strength in the country ;
they not only defeated in argument the Panditas whe
upheld the worship, of Shiva, and rojected the duties
prescribed *in the Nilapurina, but had the influence to
discontinue the ceremonies and worship enjoined by it.
The Nigas, in consequence, rose in arms, murdered many
people, mostly Buddhists, by rolling down “ice from the
mountains 5 and carried on their devastations year by

year. The king avoided these scenes of tumult, and

was a good and powerful king, and infused new life into
the kingdom. He was the greatest of his line as Rama
was in his. It is owing to the virtues of the people that
good kings are born, and then the parts of the kingdom
long dismembered are reacquired, Those who oppress
their subjects perish with their dynasties, while those who
relieve the oppressed flourish, From a study of the
history of this king, the wise will be able to know the
signs of prosperity or adversity with regard to future
kings. He reigned for thirty-five yeazs.

injury. A Buddhist who lived in a monastery in a
certain village eloped with his queen; this so enraged
him, that he burnt thousands and thousands of monas-
teries, and gave to the Brihmanas, who dwelt at Madhya-
mata, the villages that supported those monnsterios, Ha
built a town on tho banks of the Vitnsté, which he Jaid
out with spacious roads, and adorned with the spoils of
other countries. It was crowded with rich shops, and
graced with Suit and flowor gardens, and the river below
was covered with boats.

Now, in this city dwelt a Brahmana Shose wife (the
daughter of a Nign)* was possessed of exceeding
benuty, inso much that the king heard of het beauty
through spies, and became enamoured of her. Not even
the fear of discredit could check his wayward. heart,
Then, agait, arqccident fatned his passion beyond con-

on the animal. This the king heard, and, enamoured
as ho was of her, became more violent. Ho first employdd
porsons to scduce her, who tormontod hor with tempta-

in his passion, asked for her of her own husband. This
failed also, and ho recoived only abusive Janguage in
return, from the offonded husband. At last ho sent
somo soldiors to snaich away tho girl, Whilo the
soldiors wero atiacking tho house on the front, tho

sult which tho king had intended to offer to his daughter.
The Naga became enraged, and in his vengeance burnt
down tho city; thousands who fed to Chakrachara for
sholter were also burnt, and the Vitasta ran pollnted
with scorched human remains. Tho king perished in the
conflagration,

The passion of the king may appear to the senseless
as nothing guilty, but for that passion Nara I. suffered
what none over suffered. When a king, under the
pretence of protacting his subjects, oppresses them, he
geuerally meets such a death unawares. For it is known
that the anger either of a chaste woman, or of a Bralhmana

This king reigned over a period of thirty-nine years

of Kinnavapura became as beautiful as Gandharvvapura.

with his sorvants went up bodily to Mahédovaloka, and

Ho was succeeded by his son Hiranyékshd. Ho built
a city called after his own name, and reigned for thirty-
seven yenrs and seven months.

and his presence and that of his army, were known by

the dead.® Ounce he sav the breasts of his queen
marked with foot-prints of a golden color. This enraged
him, and he called for explanation from the keeper of
the zenana. The keeper replied that the queen wofe a
bpddice made of Ceylon cloth, and that the Cingaleso
marked their clothes with golden foot-marks which
denoted the foot-prints of their king. Whereupon he
reached the Southern Sea and invaded Ceylon, He
assuaged his anger by killing tho king of tho place, set
up another, a cruel man on his throne, and returned to
his kingdom, bringing with him from Ceylon a picture of
the sun named Ushadeva, On his return he passed
through Chola, Karndta, Nita, &c. The kings of these
places fled on his approach, and returned to their
ravaged capifals after he had gone away. When entering
Kashmira, one hundred of his elephants were startled
by the crtes of one elephant which had fallen into a den,
and the king ordered the hundred elephants to be
killed. As the touch of the sinful pollutes the body,
so the narration of his history pollutes the speeah, One
day when he was descending in to the river Chandra-
kulyé, on his way stood a heavy block of stone which
could not be moved. Now, he dreamt o dream after-
wards, that the gods spoke unto him, and said, that a
Youksha, (a spirit,) resided in it, and that it could not be
moved but by'a chaste woman, He then put his dream

to proof, and many a citizen’s wilo tried to move that
atone in vain, till Chandravati, wifesal a pottor, accoms
plishod the feat. The king wis enraged to fiid so many
women unchaste ; he orderod them to be killed together
with their husbands, sons and brothers, threo Aotis in all |
'Tifis action is lauded by some, but such magsacro should
be condemned. That the people did not rebel against thejr
king and kill him, was because the gods defended him.

However he did some virtuous acts ; he set up the god
Mlibireshvarn, named after him, in Shrinegara, and found-
ed a grent city in Wola called Mihirapursa after his name.
He also bestowed some villages on the Bréhmanas of
Gandhéra, who were equally vicious with the king. These
Bréhmanas woro so shameless as to cohabit with their
sisters and the wives of their sons. Thoy were born of
Mleohchhas. It isa wonder that such people over existed,
They sold their wives as they did other articles, and their
wives too were shameless enongh to live with others. Tho
yainy season pleases the peacocks, ond a clear autumn
pleases the hansas; so he who gives, and they who
receive, ave of the samo temper. In his old age thus
terror of the world became infirm, and suffered frum
many maladies, He therefore caused a fire to,bo kindled,
and voluntarily entered into the fame. “And at the time
of his death he heard heavenly voice proclaimed that even
the king who killed three kotiy of mon entered heaven,
for ho was cruel to his own porgou. *

Some say that jis sins were palliated hy his gift of
Villages. ‘Bhéy say that when these Bréhmanas of Darnd
who were born of Miechchhas, and who sold their wives,
spread themselves in the country, the king established
many good rites and extended the Kingdom of +he
Aryas and performed hard tapa, and at last gave his hody
#9 the flames. He gavo thousands of villages in Vijayesh-
vara to the Bréhmanas of Géndhgra. Thus died the king
falling into tho fire which kindled on swords, rasors &a,
and thus he expiated his sing. He reigned for seventy
years,

After his death tho citizens raised his son Vaka, a very
good prince, to the throna, At first they wore mistrustful
of him ag they wero of his father, but in course of time
they liked him, and welcomed his reign after that of hia
predecessor, as one welcomes the rains after summer.
Virtue returned, as if, from another world, and gafety
from exile in the forest ; and peace and security were
re-established in tho kingdom. Ho founded a city name
Lavanotsa. At last, Vatté, a female devotee, came to
the king one night in the shape of a beautiful woman,
and with enticing words persuaded him to be present at a
religious festivat at her place. There the king went, but
instead of witnessing a fostival, he with his many sous
and grandsons were all sacrificed except one son, A

YoDHIsHTHIRA in his old age relinquished all hopes of
regaining his kingdom, and much humbled, abandoned all
enjoyments. But others maintain that he was confined
by his ministers in fort Agaliks as he was attempting
to get back his kingdom,

‘After deposing Yudhishthira the ministgrs coronated ona
Pratapdditya, a relative of Vikramaditya, king of some
distant country. Some writers erroneously believe, that
this was Vilraméditya [of Oujin], the enemy of Saka,
The kingdom was torn by internal discord and was for
some time governed by Harsha and other kings. Pratép-
aditya ruled well and died after a reign of thirty-two
years.

He was sucoeeded by his son Jalauka. This prince
derived his glory from his father, and reigned with equal
glory for the same period as his father, it was like the
full moon which succeeds the sun when days and nights
are equal,

Him succeeded his son Tungjina, who shored the admi-
nistration with his queen. This king“and queen graced
the warld as the Ganges and the Crescent beautify the

named Katika, and reised a iemple to Mahddeva Tun-
geshvara, They alo planted trees in the burning plains
of Marave.~ In their reign 1 lived Ohandroka a partial in-

carnation of Vayasa the great poet. He invented a sort
of dance. A severe calamity visited the kingdom in this
reign, as if to test the noble hearts of the sovereigns, “In
the season of autumn, in the month of Bhadra, a andden
and heavy frost blighted the sali grain that was then
ripening, aud the consequence was a severe famine which
threatened the destruction of the people. Natural foelings
were smothered, nor shame nor pride nor nobility was
then remembered. Every one became mad with hunger,
nor cared for his wife or son or futher, but devoured what
he could get, unmindful of the solicitations of his wife or
child, sou or father wenk and famished with hunger.
Men were reduced to bare skeletons disgusting to the
sight ; they abused and fought with one another for food,
aud oppressed with hunger they cast theit eyes on every
direction éager to satisfy their appetite by destroying
every living thing. At this time of distress, the king
and the queen showed the greatest humanity; they
invited the people to their palace and fed them ; they im-
ported rice, from other cowntries, defraying tho expenses
from their own treasury, as well as from those of theis
ministers ; aud fed the people day and night. Every one
was taken care of whether residing in houses, or wander-

ing ih woods or streets or in the burning ghat. One

night when the king found that his treasures were speut,

and there was no tice, he was much grieved and said
to his queen: “Surely O queen ! fo. some sing of ours
this great calamity has bofallen our people. Wo is me
before whose eyes these people are dying of hunger;
and since I cannot save these our helpless subjects, what
is the use of my living? In consequence of much anzi-
ous care and attention there has been no mortality as yet.
But now that the earth is reduced to poverty and de-
prived all glory, no means are left to deliver the people
from this great calamity. It seems that the end of
the world is nigh; the mountain passes are blocked up
with snow, and there is no way left for people to go
out of the country; and they are doomed to die here.
Sea how the men, the heroic, the wise aud the learned
have been reduced. How in our days of prosperity,
splendour smiled on every side, and now it is gone.
Let me perish in the flames since I see no means to
relieve my subjects, and I am unable to sce them die,
Happy are those kings who secing their subjects as thoir
sons, at eoso, can pass their nights in poace.” Thus say-
ing, the tender-hearted king fell on his bed, and covering
his face with cloth began to weep profusely. There was
no wind, and the lamp burnt ateadily with along flame.
The queen saw him in that condition and thus consoled
him : -“ How the misfortune of your subjects has turned
your sense that you lose your patience and behave like
vulgar men! If the evil be inevitable, no one oan ‘avert
it. But failure reflects no discredit on the great, Women

should love their husbands, ministers should remain
fuithful, and the kitg should protect his subjects with-
out deviating his attention to any other affair, Arise O
king! my words are never spoken in vain, your suh-
jects’ distress is over.’ When the queen had finished
her noble speech, dead pigeons dropped in every house
and the people lived on them. The king saw this and
relinquished his intention of committing suicide. But
lothed to destroy animal life the queen contrived to
prevent the supply of these birds. In the meantime
the sky cleared up ond the famine disappeared. The
queen gave the villages of Katfmusha and Rémusha
to Brahmanns. The king died after a reign of thirty-six
years, aud his queen, unable to bear the affliction, perished
by burning herself. The place where she died is called
Vikkashtatavi. There a place of rest for travellers wag
erected, aud many weary wanderers from various countries
are fed even to this day. They died withdut issue, God
did not favor them with a son, but what oan commemo-
rate them better thau their own acts, The sweet sugar-
cane bears no fruit, but no fruits could be sweeter. Some
say that the queen perished in the flames, because she
thought thet tha famine was brought in by her sins.

dynasty, He built a town named Vijayeshvara aud reign-
ed for eight years.

the iing lod by hig flatterors suspected him of evil
designs bocauso of his gront wisdom, He was forbidden
to approach the king, his properly was confisoated, and
he was reduced to povorty for the rest of his days. Nor
was‘ there any officer of tho court who spoke to him, for
the courtiers are but the echoes of the king. But neither
‘the anger of the king nor his own poverty ruffled his
tempor; for still he passed his days happily in the
worship of his god. Evenin his devotieus ho was not
suffered to romain in peace, There wasn rumour that
the time would come when Sandhimati would reign, His
enemies at court hinted to the king that the ex-minister
had spread this rumour; and the king, alarmed at the
probable consequences, threw Sandhimati into prison,
ehoined with a heavy chain. There ho remained for ten
years till the time of the king’s death. Whon the last
days of the kifig approached, the pain of his illness was
aggravated by his fear that the imprisoned Sandhimati
would sueceed him, as he was childloss. And to remove
his anxieties, he intended to exeeute the minister, But
however wisely man may contrive for his good, it is in
the power of Fate, to turn it to his evil, Jf there be

any accident he failed to do this, he would order his
servants to collect a thousand storfus in their stead ;
and after worship, threw them into a tank or river
which looked like Narmaddé; and such a collection of
stones ig still to be seen. He filled his court with Rishis,
besmearod with ashes and with jatés in their heads, and
his country with large temples and large lingas, with
big images of bulls, and huge tridents. The villages

thevefora began to look for another whom they could
raise to the throne; and they came to hear that there
lived au ambitious prince of” the line of Yudhishthira, the
Blind.

Gopiditya, the king of Géndhara, in the hope of
conquering Kashmira, had given shelter to the great
grgud-son of Yudhishthira. This exiled prince had 9 son
named Meghavéhana, whom his father sent to the coun-
try of East Yotisha to be present ot the Sayamvara
marriage of the daughter of its king who was a Visnwe
vite; and he had the fortune of boing selected as the
husband of the princess, Tle was also presented with
an umbrella, which was got from Varuna by king Naraka
and which cast its shade on none but a paramount king.
This connection gave himsome importance in the eyes
of the people who believed that ho would one day rise
to power. And after his return with his wife to his
father, the ministors of Kashmfra invited him to accept
the sceptve of their country, he being the descend-
ant of their ancient king. Saudhimati, othorwise called
Aryyargja, found his kingdom weakened by internal
disagreement, but took no steps to mend matters,
On the contyary, he was fnxious to resign his office,
believing that “Vis tutelary god had given him a fitting
opportunity to relieve himself of his kingdom, and to
engage himself in devotion, He thought himself happy

kingdom of his own free will, an& was not compelled
to do it by force; and that during the Ioug poriod of
his reign there had been no misrule. “ Fortunately”
he said “Tam not grieved to resign my office, nor blame
my fortune for it’. Thus resolved, and making his mind
akingdom in itself, he one day assembled his subjects
and resigned the kingdom into their hands after a reign
of forty-seven years, as if he returned to them what was
outrusted to him for safe keeping. Many people tried
to induce him to retain his office, but in vain, Having
once resighed it, he refused to accept the kingdom
again, Dressed as @ hermit, and, clad in white oloth
and without a turban, he went on foot towards the north
like a devotee, spoaking to none, and fixing his eyes on
his feet. Many of his late subjects followed him weep-
ing silently. After he had proceeded more than four
miles, he snt doavn under a tree, and having consoled his
weeping followers, he sont them back. In this way he
procecdad, loitering at the foot of the hills, and as he
went on further his subjects gradually left him. With
a. few attendants he began to ascend the mountains, At
last taking leave of his lnat weeping followexs, he enter-
ed the woods, where many a hermit slept in his cavorn
home. , There in the evening ho built a cottage beside
a tank, and within it made a bed of leaves, keeping his
water ina pot made of the same material. The thoon

the Mallikg tree slept the mill women; and there Was
heard the muito of the fountains mingled with that of
the goat herds’ Iute,—all these lulled the weary king
to rest. The howl of the wild bensts, and the ory of
karlaretu told him that the night was past. Rising frém
hig sleep, he performed his morning devotions and re-
paired to the celebrated shrine of Sodara. There in
Nandikshetra he stood before the image of Mahadeva
besmeared with aghes, his locks of hair tied, his hand

Artur the resignation and retirement of the late king,
tha ministers who presided over the council of the people,
went to Géndhara, and brought with them the renowned
Meghavahana, whom they crowned king; and who after.
wards proved to be a good and kind-hearted sovereign ;
and the expectations that were entertained of him were
fully realized. His tenderness for animal life was even
greater than that of a Buddhist high priest. He forbade
the slaughter of animals in his kingdom, and as compen-
sation to the hunters who lived by killing animals, he
paid them money. He performed two yajugas. He built a
village named Meghavana and peopled it with Brdhmanas
and set up a monastery named Meghamatha. His queen
Amritaprabhé caused a Vihéra named Amritabhavana to
be built for Buddhists, and another of his queens Yuka-
devi, in emulation of her rival, built a wonderful Vihéra
at Nadavana, one half of which edifice waa ocoupied by
Bhuddhist students, and jn the other half lived men of
the same persuasion with theiy,wives aud family. Another
of his queens, Indradevi, built a high vestangular monas
tery and called it Indradevibhavana after her name
Others of his queens Khidana, Masmé, &c. followed the
same example, building monasteries and calling «them
after their respective names, This prince Jed an er

pedition to compel other kings to desist from killing
animals; and carriedy fis arms to the sea, and even
ta Ceylon, making the subdued kings promise not to
. kill animals.* When ho reached the hill of Rohana
m Ceylon, his srmy rested under the shadows of palm
trees. Vibhfishana, the king of the country, met him om
friepdly terms with songs and loud chantings. Then the
king of Langké led the king of Késhmira to Langkd,
and entertained him. He forebade the use of flesh
among his subjects, who, as Riékshasas, largely consumed
it, Vibbishana then gave the king of Kashmfra several
flags in which the Rakshasas were represented in a bow-
ing posture. Even to this day on every occasion that
a king of Kashmiva goes out, these flags which are called
Paradhvajas, are borne before him. Thus he forbade the
use of animal food even in the kingdom of the Rakshasas
aud then returned to his own. From that time none
violated the kiug’s order against the destruction of
auimals, neither in water, uorin the skies, nor in forests
did animals kill one another. We are ashamed to relate
the history of this good king to vulgar men, but those
who write according to the Rishis do not care for the
taste of theiv heavers. .The king died after a reign of
thirty four years. ”

He was sucaseded by his son Shreshtasena who, was
seon known as Pravatasena and also as Tungjina, Ha

which he had set up. He ruled over other kings, ani j

Of his two sons, Hiranya became king, and Ton.
andon assisted his brother ia the administration of the;
kingdom. Now the latter forbade the use of the coins
struck by king Vala, and largely cireulated the Dfuna

displeasure, who looked upon it asa mark of disrespect -
towards himself, and imprisoned his brother, Toraménss
wifo Angjang, daughter of Vajrendra of the line of Tksha
ku, shared her husband’s confinement, and in the prisoa
she became pregnant. Inthe fulness of time she wns
necretly delivered of a boy in a potter's house, being
whamed of publicity. The potter's wife brought up the
child, its real parentage being known only to her and to
its mother. And at the mother’s request the child wy
called by the uname of its grandfather, (father’s father},
As the child grew up, he disliked the companionship of
the sons of the potter's neighbours, and the people often
wondered to see him play with the children of the nob.

select him as king, and he would keep them under his
control, and bestow favors on them, nor would: he allow
them to do anything wrong. The earth which the pette

cave him to make pots, he would convert to Shiwalinyts.

It go happened, that“fayendra, the maternal wucle of

the boy, met him one day in his play, and carressed him ;
but seeing something extraordinary in the boy and _per-
ceiving some resemblance in him with his sister’s hus-
band, suspected the truth about his birth. The boy did
nol kuow him, and remained quite indifferent though
wformed of his name. Drawn by curiosity, the uncle
followed the child and entered with him into the potter's
house, and there discovered his sister. The brother and
sister looked on eacksother and sighed and wept in grief.
Then the boy asked the potter’s wife whom he nsed to
addvess as his mother, who they were, “Child,” said
sho, “this is your mother, and this your maternal unele.”
The child became angry on henring the account of his
father’s confinement and acting on the advice of his uncle
(who soon after returned to his country) found means
to deliver his father from his prison, but the poor man
died soon after. His mother then attempted suicide,
but wag prevented by her son from so doiug. He toc
felt the worthlessuess of the world, and set out on
pigrimage. Atthis time died Hiranya after a reign of
thirty years aud tyro mopthse without leaving any issue.
At this time there reigued 9 powerful king at Ujjayini
named Vikramdditya otherwise galled Harsha, He subdu-
ed the whole world, and destroyed the Shakas, a Mlech-
ohha tribe. He was a man blessed with uncommon good
forbune, and was glso a great patron of the learned. Now

in his court lived a great poet named MAtrigupta whose
fame spread over many countries.” “He had visited Several
courts, and at last fixed his ‘yesidence at Ujjayini, induced
by the liberality and justice of its king, and hoping that
his services would be rewarded by one who discerned
‘the merits of persons, and did not favor the hypooritical,
the quarrelsome, or the pretentious. The king by, his
just awarda had gained the hearts of all men, and no
man of lore had to murmur at the gifts he received of
' the king, He marked the assiduity of.those who served
him, and if one could not please hiss by his worl, his
labor was indeed futile, like selling ice in the Himalayas,
Ho had no servants to pander to his,lust, or to speak ill
of others, or who were jealous of strangers. He did not
take the advice of conceited or selfwilled persons, and
even a bad man who was once acquainted with him,
Joved him. “Since by my good fortune,” thought
Mitrigupta, “I have come to this king, I see my hopes
well nigh fulfilled.” So he determined to serve this
wise and sober king, and no more to wander about in
different courts. Thus determining, he used to attend
the court, as ordered by the king, but would not take
his seat among the learned: Fyery one who is learned
is not great, thought the king, but this man’s earnestness
requires special notice. In order to test his merits, the
king did not at first show him any favor. Hoe gladly
continued, however, to serve the king, and his services
were neither too showy nor too meagre, nor was the


--- Page 50 ---
KINGS OF EASuMfNA. 41

king displeased with him. Mitrigupta followed his master
like his shadow, in oa@€r to gain his favor. He would
uot look on the female servhnts of the king, nor sit with
those who envied his master, nor would he speak with
the vulgar in the king’s presence, nor would tell him
whatever evil things the envious courtiers had snideof
the king. He did not mind the jokes of the royal
servants, but would patiently serve his majesty whatever
others might say to lessen his attachment to his master.
He would freely gpeak of the merits of other men and
show his own,§Je was liked by the courtiers, And
thus he passed one year.

One day when the king was going ont, he saw this
mon weak and emaciated, and wearing a torn piece of
cloth ; and he felt grieved that in order to test his merit
he had guffered this poor though worthy and persevering
man, wandering friendless in 4 foreign country, to remain
in such affliction ; that he had left him to suffer in heat
and in cold without taking notice as to how this poor
man ate or clothed himself, a8 to who gave him medicine
when he was ill, who consoled hin. when he was grieved,
or who soothed him when he was weary. What could
he possibly give in return,.that he had subjected him ta
so hard a test? Fhe king could not think of anything
he would give him ag an adequate recompense, for his
services, Thus time rolled on tillit was winter, and -
it was 4 severe winter. Jt was dark in every direction,
days became short, and the sun hurried .to the sea te
warm himself in the fire within it,

432 KINGS OF KASHMERA.

Now, it so happened that the king awoke in his bed one
night; the fire was burning brightry in his room, but
the lamp was flickering in the cold breeze, and inorder
to stir the lamp he called ont for his guards. But all |
‘were sleeping at ease, and to his call “who waits outside?
the king only heard the reply, “I Métrigupta.” Then, .
by the king’s order, he entered the splendid room and
stirred the lamp. And as he was hurrying ont, the king
ordered him to wait. Trembling with fear and sold,
Miitrigupta waited there. The king ,then asked him
how much of the night yet remained-r One prahara’
replied he. “ How isit that you know the hour of the
night, and why did you not sleep,” enquired the king,
Jonsidering this to be tha opportunity when if he related
his condition, his fate would be decided either for good
or for evil, Métrigupta quickly composed a verse and
said :—“ Sunk in the sea of anxiety, and oppressed by
the chilling month, while hunger has mellowed my voice,
my lips ave quivering, speaking of contentment within;
and sleep like an abused wife has fled far from me;
and the night to me endureth long, like the reign of a
good king.” The king heard him, and after consoling
him, sent him back to his plagg, reproaching himself
that even after knowing the sorrows Bf a worthy man,
he had not yet resolved what to do. “The man must be
grieved to thiuk,” said the king to himself, “ that I have
taken his case so coolly. Though I have been thinking
i of giving him something for a long time, I have not yet


--- Page 52 ---
KINGS OF RASUMERA. 43

found out what to give. Ilis good words now remind
me that the beautifie*kingdom of Kashmira is at present
without a king, and T will bestow that kingdom on him
superseding other suppliant kings.” Fully bent on this
purpose the king despatched messengers privately that
very night ordering the Kashmirians to crown without
hesitation one named Matrigupta who would produce
his order. And when the messenger had gone, he did
not again sleop that night before he had got his order
written out. Oy the other hand, Métrigupta becamé
disheartened agdebhought that his conversation with the
king had boon of no avail. “Ihave dona my duty,”
thought he, “aud my oxpectation is uow at an end ;
now devoid of further hopes I shall wander about in
peace. Through somo unavoidable mistake I was Jed
to believe, fromm what I had heard from others, that this
king was worth serving. But fame speaks not the truth.
The king is iutelligent and bestows riches on those he
favors; the king is not to blame, my own sins are the
cause of my misfortune, If the shores on which the
sea casts jewels cannot be reached in consequence of!
adverse wind, it is the man’s ill-luck and not the sea that
is to blame. If one wighox for rewards, he should rather
serve the king's” Bervants than the king, for to serve
the king is a laborious task. Those who worshjp the
feet of Shiva get ashes from the person of the deity,
hut those who worship the feet of his bull gat gold every
day, Ido not know that I have committed any fault

for which the king might take offence, He whom bua
ness leads to the king derives no bénafit unless applauded
by the public, whilo sven the low if admired by the
publio is taken notice of by the king. Particles of water
when in sea, are not taken notice of, but when they are
token up by the clouds, and are thrown back to the
embraces of the wavy ocean, they look like pearls.” Thus
thought be, and lost all regard for his master the king,
Even the wisdom of the wise is lost in misfortune.
* When the day dawned, and the king took his seal in
the court, ho ordered a peon to call in-Métrigupta. The
peons forced the despniring sage into the royal presence,
and when he had bowed to the king, the king signed
to his record-keeper to deliver him the order. Tho king
then addressing Métrigupta asked him if he knew the
way to Kashmira. “Go there,” said he, “and deliver
that order to the ruler in charge of the country.” Ho
made him promise by his royal person that he would
not read the order in his way. ‘I will do as’ you com-
mand,” said Mitrigupta, and went out of the court,
\ got knowing the good fortune that awaited him. And
the king resumed his usual work. The people were
grieved to see Matiigupte travallipg friendlies and help-
less, and blamed the king for employing so worthy a man
in thjs Jow work of carrying letters. “The foolish
king,” said they, “hag considered this man fit to undergo
toils, beenuse he served him diligently day and ‘night
in hope of future good. Servants serve their master


--- Page 54 ---
KINGS OF KASHMIRA. 45

in hope of bettering their future, but when the master
,loes not understand their purpose, he thinks them fit
only to serve. The serpent in the hope of freeing himself
from the fear of Gadura served Néréyana. But Nars-
yana thought the serpent accustomed to bear heavy
weights, and so ordered him to bear the earth. This
learned man saw Ehat the king favors the learned,
and being himself learned took shelter with him, but
who understands human nature so little as the king who
hag thus employed the learned Matrigupta? The peacock
dances with jéy72 the sight of the rainbow in the clouds,
believing it to be a tail of their kinsman, but the clonds
return him nothing but rain drops.” Poor Métrigupta
felt neither doubt nor anxiety, he consoled himself with
the good omens he met in his way. Once he saw a khang-
jana bird sitting on a serpent’s head; at another time
he dreamt that he had ascended a palace, and crossed the
sea; and assured himself thereby that the king’s orders
must be for his bencit. “If I gain even a little in
Késhmira,” thought he, “that would be preferable to any-
thing in any other country,” In the way he found no
difficulty, being hospitably entertained wherever he
lodged. Af lastthe<iow-white Himilaya, rising to the
skies, appeared before him, variegated with diverse trees ;
nnd he breathed the air bearing the perfumes “of the
pinegeand particles of Ganges water. In Kramavarta
he fouhd a drum which can be seen even now at
Bhurapura. Here, in this populous Kramavaria he

16 HINGS OF KASTINERA,

heard that for some rengon the ministers of Kgshmirn
were waiting at that place. He therefore left his old
dregs, pnt on a white one, and went to the ministers to
deliver to them king Vikraméditya’s order. As he went
to the ministers auspecious signs were seen, the crowd
therefore collected behind him, anxious to see tho result
of luis message. When he arrived at the house, aud the
door-keeper learnt that he had come from the king of
Ujjayini, he quickly informed ithe ministers of his
approach, and with their permissiot: Matngupta
entered into their presence, And whet “the ceremony
of welcoming was over, the ministers pointed out to him
a magnificent seat to sit upon, and asked him about
the orders of Vikramdditya; whereupon he humbly
presented to them the writing which they received
bowing. The ministers then retired to read the order,
and veturaing meekly asked him if his name was
the great Métrigupta. He smiled and replied in the
afirmative. Then they called those who were nent,
ordering them to bring things for coronation. The
crowd became great and boisterous like a rough sea.
Matrigupte sat on a golden seat with his face towards
the east, aud the people bowed tim, end ‘bathed him
king. The water streamed along his breast as the Reva
along the Vinddbya mountain. When he had bathed and
was anointed and adored with ornaments and ceated
on the throne, his subjects informed him that when the
throne had become vacant they had applied to Vikramé-

RINGS OF KASHUFRA. 47
ditya for n king, ang Vikvaméditya had sent him to
sthem. “Now be you oug protector.” Yet it was not
to Vikraméditya alone that he was indebted for a throne ;
for thore were others who helped him to it. “ Still” said
they “you need not lower yourself in your own estimation
by thinking that you are obliged to any for the post you
have attained.” Métrigupta heard this and smiled,
remembering the benefit he had received from Vikramé-
ditya. That day was passed in giving gifts, &c., and op
a subsequent d&y when his ministers asked him to enter
into the int4ffor of his territory, he sent a messenger
to Vikramdditya with large presents; and fecling him-
self ashamed of getting so good a country compared
even with that of Vikramaditya himself, he sent another
of his servants to him with edible things though of small
value, and also sent a verse composed by himself with
tears of gratitude im his eyes, to the following effect :-—
* You who always do good to others, do not wear the
appenrance of what you do; like the cloud thnt rains
without thundering. Thy favor is known by the fruit,”
Matrigupta then ontered into the interior of the
country accompanied by his vast army, and commenced
his reign. “Therg was limit to his charity or mauli-
ness. Once he made preparations for a religions feast,
but when every thing was ready he had not the heart to
kill animals; and he forbade the destruction of animals
in his kingdom. He prepared a certain kind of food in
which gold dusts were mixed, and when he distributed

48 RINGS OF KASHMERA.

this food every one was satisiied. His good qualities and
bounties attracted more peraors to ing court than to the
conxt of Vikramdditya, And he bestowed his gifts with
judgment. The poet Mentha or Métrimentha, ss he wag
sojnetimes called, lived in his court, and composed
work named Hnyagrivabadha. This work, when in pro.
gress, he showed to the king, but the king did net
pronounce avy opinion till the beok was complete, when
the king rewarded the author by bestowing wealth on him,
and placed the copy in a golden vess¢l lest its beauty
be lost, so that the poot considered hidisélSdoubly paid.
He set np an image of god Madhusudhana which hs
named Métriguptasvami. The villages which he bes
towed on this god were afterwards retaken by Mamma
to defrny the expenses of building the house of his
father-in-law. Thus reigned Mitrigupta for a period of
four years, nine months and one day,

Now, on the other hand, the son of Angjnnd, after he
had performed the ceremonies fur the salvation of the
souls of his ancestors, with the waters of holy places,
heard that a stranger had usurped the throne of his
forefathers, and was ruling in Kishmira, This inflamed
him s0 much as to mnke hintforgotchis grief for the
death of his father.* When the prince arrived at
Késhmfra, he learnt the state of the country ; and the
ministers came to him, and were ready to revolt against

Mitrigupte. But he declined to countenance thew re

bellion, “Iam eager,” he said, “to destroy Vikramé-
dyjtya, but T am not*angry with Miatrigupta, For what
is the use of harassing those who are weak and can-
not endure pain? there is glory in rooting out those
who are strong. What can be more frail and feeble
than the lotuses which envy the moon, and what pro-
ptiety is there that such lotuses should be torn by
elephants’ tusks? It is strange that one should show
his valour on those who are not his equal; he who is
really great will wot be angry with his infetiors.” He
turned his arges~against Trigarttea and conquered it,
and commenced his march against Vikramgditya. But
on his way he heard that Vikramdditya was dead.
This pews so much afflicted him, that he neither bathed
nor ate nor slept that day but sighed and wept for
his dead antagonist. On a subsequent day he heard
that Méatrigupta had left his kingdom, and had come
out of Kgshmfra, and was in the neighbourhood of
the place ‘where he himself then was, Suspecting that
it was some of his partisans who had driven Maétri-
gupta ont of the kingdom, he went to the ex-king
clad in a simple dress, and after the ceremonies of
welooming were, over, geatly asked him the cause of
resigning his kingdom, The other replied after sighing,
and with asad smile, “O king, dead is that virtuous
monareh who made me king, I am like a sun-jewel that
brightens so Jong as the sun shines on it, but is a com-
mon stone when the sun is set.” Who has injured

thoo,” then asked Pravarasona, “4 that thou grievest for
Vikraméditya, unbble to be revenied on those who hays
done thee harm?” “Who is so strong as can injure
me,” eaked Matrigupta with dignity, “think not that .
Vikraméditya poured git on ashes, or sowed seeda on
farren soil.” “ But,” continued he, “ even the inanimats
objects are grateful to those who do them good. The
sun-jewel looks dim when the sun is set, and ao doss
the moon-jewel when the moon is out of sight. I will
therefore fo to the holy city of Varéeasi, and enjoy the
Pleasures of devotion by being a heemts, For without
Vikramaditya the world is dark. I cannot look on it
through fear, far less enjoy it.” Astonished at his words
the young prince replied, “‘ True, O king, that the world
has produced jewels, since it is adorned by persons like
you; who oan understand human nature better than
Vikramaditya, since he discovered your noble qualities.
Long was the path to gratitude closed, now you are
traversing the way. The low and the ungrateful think
that it is through their good fortune that they receive
gifts from their masters, and they argue that if they
had not worth in them, their masters would not single
them out, when there were tihex poor fifiends, Or if
they had not discovered some faults in their masters,
and 4£ their miserly masters had not stood in fear
of them, would they have given them away anvthing?

jewel, art loved by the # good. So do me a favor by not
resigning the crown, “and let the people know, that I toc
am partial to men of ment. This kingdom was first
given to thee by Vikramdditya, I bestow it on you now,
so accept it again.” Matrigupta heard this noble speech,
and smiled and said, “I am compelled to be a litth
ungivil to give expression to my feelings, but though it
may be harsh, yet I must say, that I disvegard your no-
ble gift. You know my former low position, and [know
yours, our presen§ greatness is felt by ourselves aloue.*
You cannot up tcsstand the motive which induces me to
reject, nor can I understand that which induces you to
offer me the kingdom. Being now a king,*how can I
accept your gift? Ov if I had wished to enjoy the king-
dom why should I forsake it myself? Shall I slight the
gift of my benefactor for mere enjoyment, and leave the
duties that befit me now? The benefit which he did to
ma, I can never repay, it is therefore lostin me. T will
now follow him, and show that he was not mistaken in
his estimation of me. This is all that I have to do in
this world, ‘This then I will perform, and leave off all
enjoyment.” Then said Pravarasena that he would nat
touch Métrigupte’s prepsrty while he was alive, And
when Métrigupta avent to Varguasf and became a hormit,
Pravarasena, true to his words, used to send him the in-
come derived from Késhmira, Matzigupta, on the other
hand, distributed the money in charity to the poor; and
thus lived for ten years, Thus three men Vikraméditya,

Matrigupta, and Pravarasena vied with one another in
virtue. . ~ .
Pravarasena subdued many kings, and his fame spread
far and wide like that of Agasta muni, and his army
reached the sea in their march of conquest; and the per.
gspiration of his elephants made the waters of the Ganges
look like the confluence of that river with the Yamuni,
He defeated the people of Saurashtra and upset the ad.
uoinistration of the kingdom. His mind was so bent on
the acquisition of fame, thathe was indifferent to all earthly
things, having neither attachmont nor 2etsed towards any
object. Pratépasila otherwise called Shiliditya, son of
Vikramaditya, was expelled by his enemies from his
father’s territory. Pravarasena reinstated him, and
brought back the throne of the kings of Kashmira from
the capital of Vikramgditya. Pratépasfla for seven times
refused to acknowledge the supremacy of the king of
Kishmira, an@ the latter had to subdue him seven times,
On the eighth occasion, Pravarasena called Pratépasila a
brute and intended to take his life. The latter, however,
saved himaelf by selfhumilation, and suggested that if
he was a beast, his life was too insignificant to he destroy-
ed. Pratapasfla also amused “the Kishmirfin king by
dancing before his court like a peacock, and imitating tho
voice of that bird ;-whereupon Pravarasena not only took
him under his protection, but also bestowed riches on him.
After conquering the world, he lived in the city raised

own name,” In the village of Sharitaka Prayarasena pro-
posed to build a city.« But before he did ao, he wished to
set up Pravareshvara Shiva, and he employed artisans
for the purpose. But an image of Shiva aprung up from
the ground from among the instruments of the workmen,
and it was named Jayasviémi from Jaye the name of ons
of the sculptors. The god Vinayaka Bbimasvami who
faced towards the west, without any human agency turn-
ed himself and faced towards the east, for the welfare of
the intended town. The king further set up images of *
five goddesses S~Jbhivashri and others, each having sho%
after her name. He caused to be built alarge bridge of
boats on the Vitasté, and from that time the bridge of
hoats became known to the world. His matermal uncle
Jayendra built a large Butldhist vihéra named Jayendra-
vihéra after his name. And his minister Moraka, who
raled Ceylon, built a beautiful house named Morakabhava-
na, The new city which was enlarged by Yishvakarmma
and Soma, was raised on the southern bank of the
Vitasté, and contained thirty six lacs of houses, it con-
tained several market places, and its high houses
touched the clouds, from whose tops, in the rainy
season the emrth,could be-seen drenahed with rain; and
in Chaitra sprinkled with flowers. In this city alone the
rows of the houses of amusements were built just on the
river, and the hill of recreation was in the centre of the
town, from whose top the whole city could be seen. In

the hot season tho inhabitants of tho city could get the
wool waters of the Vitasté at heir doors, And the royal
gifts to the gods of the city were so rich, that they could
buy the world a thousand times. The forehead of the
king was marked with the sign of aula over which hig
vhita hairs flowed like the Ganges on the head of Shiva,
Thus reigned Pravarasena for sixty years.

His son Yudhishthira II. born of his queen Ratnaprabhg

thon reigned for twenty one years and three months. One

" of his ministers named Vajrendra, son pf Jayendra, built
a village named Bhavachchheda witheeksityas &o. He
had othor chief ministers named Kumférasena &e. of great
renown.

He was succeeded by his son Navendraditya alias
Lakshmana, born of his quoed Padmivati. He had two
ministers named Vajra and Kanaka sons of Vajrendra;
aud his queen's name was Vimalaprabhs. He died after
a reign of tlfirteen yenrs, after building: an office for
depositing books and records,

His younger brother Randditya otherwise called Tung-
jinn then came to the throne. This king had a mark of

named Arriteshvara, she also set*up an image of Bud-
dha within the monastery which was built by Bhinné
queen of Meghavghana.

The queen Ranérambhé taught the king the incanta.
Yions of Shiva Hétakeshvra, by virtue of which one could
enter the world below. For many years the king devoted
himself to beooming an adept in this art. He retired
first to Ishtiké, and afterwards to Nandishilg ; and at

last succeeded in his efforts after manp years, Told of
his suecess in 2 dream, he dived into she-eraters of Chan-
drabhégé and proceeded to the cave of Namuchi, pursn.
ing his way for twenty-one days through the cavern, he
and. his citizens came to the dwellings of dattya females,
with whom they made themselves free, Thus after raign-
ing for three hundred years, the king went to the god
of Pétdéla where salvation is certain. On the other hand,
when the king’ and his party were dallying with the dattya
girls, the queen retired to Shveta Dvipa. Of the many
dynasties of kings, the lines of Raghu and Gonands
wore the best, and in these Réma and Ranfditya, greatly
loved their people. The subjects of both these kings
followed them to the next workL. ‘

Him succeeded hia gon Vikramaditya, a powerful king,
who set up a Shiva named Vikrameshvara. This prince
had two ministers named Brahma and Galuna, The
former raised a monastery named Brahma matha; and the
latter caused his wife Ratnivalf to erect a Vibira, After

a reign of forty-two years his powerful younger brother
Raladitya succeeded him. .

Baldditya subdued his enemies, and his powers caused
his foe-men’s wives to wocp. His columns of viotory
can still be geen, near the northern sea, He conquered
Bangkalé, and built acity there named Kélamvya for
the habitations of the K4shmfrians, And in Kashmira
he built a village named Bhedara in tho distriot of Mada-
va for Brahmanas to dwellin. His favourite queon Vimva
set up a Shiva ato avert the evils that attend the”
Vaishya caste, mui mamed it Vimveshvara. His ministers
were Kharga, Shatrughna and Méalava, threa brothers ;
they rawed a templo, a house of gods, and erected a
bridge.

Now this king had a daughter named Ananggalekha ;
an astrologer seeing her one day with her father pro-

-phesied’to the king that his son-in.law would reign here-
after, and that the line of Gonanda would end in Bila-
dityo., The king not wishing that the kingdom would
pass away from his line throngh his daughter, tried to
oppose fate; and instead of marrying her to a king he
married her to a beautiful man nathed Durlabhavardha-
na, of the Ashveghoma* Kayastha caste, thinking that
as his daughter Was not married to one of the royal
family she would not be able to inherit the kingdom.
This Durlabhavardhana was the illegitimate son of Niga
Karkota; begotten for getting the kingdom, but the king

makes it great. He fortunately became beloved of all
on account of his just actions and good intellect, and
his father-in-law named him Prajngaditya bocause of
his great intellect, and bestowed much riches on him.

On the other hand the princess being the favourite of
her parents, and filled with youthful pride, alighted her
husband. Her association with the desolute, her Juxnri-
ous habits, the frequent visitation by young men, her
abode in her father’s house, and the milduess of her hne-

tunities of seeing the minister Khatgf™he fell in loys
with him, and abandoned herself to him. This amour
secretly gratified gradually wore off her shame, fear,
and dignity, and sho gradually became exceedingly
shameless. The minister bribed the servants with gifts
and honors, and had free access to her appartments, and
gratified his passion for the princess to the fulness of
his heart, Her husband by hor constant neglect of him,
came at last to suspeot of her bad character. The
thoughts of his wife's misconduct reduced him in body.
One night he suddenly entered her appartment in order
to ascertain tha truth. Ho found her fast asleep in the
embrace of her paramour, her ‘bosoms heavifig with long
breathings. He burnt with anger at Seeing her in this
state’of unpardonable guilt—~a sight that would have en-
raged even others than husband. And swayed altevuntely
by anger and grief, he with great difficulty, and after much
deliberation, controlled his anger. The woman whoge

passion gets the better of her sense is very pleasant
among her female companiqns in private ; looks into the
streets ; dislikes the sight of her husband and of men like
him; slighits the anger of her husband; and attends
when her husband is ill spoken of; speaks with her fe-
male companions when her husband wants her; and
prajses “those who are against him ; and turns away from
his kisses and cannot bear his embraces, nor feel any
pleasure in them ; and pretend to sleep when in bed with
her husband. They are miserable, thought Durlabbavar-
dhana, who foljpw dove, for men of little wit are undous
ky it. Who has better control over his passion than he
who has duly subdued jealousy whieh is like spasmodic
cholera. ‘The woraan” he continued ‘is for the gratifi
cation of passion, and like other things, can be enjoyed in
common; wherefore then a man whose feelings are disci-
plined, be angry on such account? Women are naturally
fickle, and who can keep them under rules? Or what is
the use of keeping them so? If the meeting of two per-
sons to gratify a passion is an honorable act, what
then is dishonorable? And since one’s own body can-
not be proved to be his, how can a woman be called
“mine?” If shedeseved death because she gives me
pain, why do I noi first kill love which is the prime root
of all? And to destroy love, I must destroy jedlousy,
first. For he who has desiroyed jealousy, hes totally
destroyed affection within half a minute.” Thus he
thought, and wrote on Kharga’s cloth the following words,


--- Page 69 ---
60 KINGS OF KAsHMfaA,

“Though you ought to have been killed, yet hove 7
spared you; this you should remember.” When Dug.
lavhavardhana had gone out of the room unperceived,
the minister awoke, and read the writings in his oloth,
This moderation of Durlabhavardhana won the minister
fo his side. He forgot his lust and the princess, and
meditated how to repay the goodness by which’ his life
was saved, in so much that he did not sleep well being
buried in thoughts as hdw to repay the goodness of the
“injured husband. n

Now after a reign of thirty-seven poars and four
months Valéditya died, and with him the Gonanda dy.
nasty became extinct. And while the chief ministers
neglected the affairs of the kingdom, the grateful Khargs
duly crowned the late king’s son-in-law, bathing hin
with the waters collected from holy places and poured
from a golden Vessel; and the kingdom thus passed
from the Govianda dynasty to that of Karkota Nign as
passed the Ganges from heaven to the head of Shiva.

There reigned ten kings. From the beginning fifty-
three.

Durlabhavardhana bad many children. The queen's
bad character was not known to any, and she built a
moyrstery named Anangabhavana. An astrologer pre
dicted that Mahlana, one of the sous of the king, would
not live long, so the boy raised a god Mahlanasvémf.
The king bestowgd a village named Chandra near the :
hill Vishokakoty: upon the Brahmanas, He also set up a
Hari named Durlabhasvimi at Shripagara, and died after
wu reign of thirty-six years,

His son Durlabhaka by queen Ananga then reigned.
Ile assumed the name of Pratapiiditya after the title of
the dynasty of his maternal grandfather by whom he was
adopted as his son. He had arich minister named Oda,
who built a village named Hanumata for thé habitation of
the Bréhmanas. This powerful king built a beautiful town
named Prat&épapura, where merchants from many places
came and settled ; and among others Nona from Rohita,
This Nous built Nouamatha for the habitation of the
Br&éhmanas of “Rohita. « The king was pleased with him,
aud invited him, and the merchant passed with him a day
and a night amidst entertainments befitting a king. When
in the morning the king asked how he was, the morchant
complained of headache on account of the smoke of the
lamp that was buruing in his room. Aud whon after-

wards the king was invited by the merchant, the king saw
that a rich stone, instead of a lamp, lighted his room.
Astonished at the luxury and riches of the merchant, and
being well entertained by his host, the king spent there
two or three days.

One day the king saw Shifnarendraprabhé, the benuti.
ful mistress [wife ?] of the merchant, and she being alone
in the house, the king felt a desire for her. On the other

« band the lady’s female attendant pointed out the king
to her, and she olso became enamonred of the king,
This mutual love might have sprung up *p consequence
of the love that existed between them in their previous
birth, or through the interposition of cupid. Hid for 9
short time behind a pillar, she gazed on the king, and
ag she went away she frequently looked behind on hit,
The king returned to his capital, but his constant and
anxious thoughts of her mode him lean; and though
he often rebuked himself, and reasoned with himself, 1
was all of no avail, “Tie,” snid the king’ to himself,
“what a sinful affection has grown up in my heart! How
powerful is love, that it overcomes reason, and reigns
in the hearé alone! Asa king, I should be afraid of
bad deeds, but what sinful temptationsshave come across
me! If.the king himself robs andther of his wife
who’ then shall punish the guilty !” Thus reasoning he
could neither leave the path of virtue, nor forget the
lady. The king’s health gave way, aud he was on the
point of death, When the merchant heard from cthe


--- Page 72 ---
KINGS OF KAsuuina, 03

people of the cause of the king’s ill health, he thus pri-
vately advised his sovereign. Now that he was reduced
to that state, virtue should no longer oppose his will,
for when life is in danger, there is nothing that should
not be done. In such a state even leamed men, whose
opinion is authority, have yielded. Life should not be
forsaken for reputation, for when a man dies, fame is
atanend, “0 king,” continued the merchant, ‘ you
need not respect me, for your benefit I can give up
my life, why nof then, an object of pleasure? If-
even now you refuse, to accept the offer, I shall send
her as & dancing girl, for sho dances well, and then
you can accept her.” Thus urged by tho merchant and
by his own affection, the king, much abashed, accepted
the lady.

The queen retrioved her character by many great
works, she set up a shiva named Shrinarendreshvara. In
time she gave birth to « son who was namecbChanda4pida.
This prince’ by his great virtues cleared the stain of
his birth. Often great characters rise superior to their
births, even ag the white raindrops fall from black
clouds. From the blunt hills is derived the sharp steel,
and from they cold water springs the sea-fire. She af-
terwards gave birth to another son named Téripfda,
and a third was born of her named Avimuktapida.
These princes were also called by the names of Vajré-
ditya, “Udaydditya, and Lalitéditya, After a reign of
fifty yeara the king died.

64 KINGS OT KaSHNIRA,

His son Chandrépida, otherwise called Vajiaditya,
ascended the throne: he performed many good deeds,
aud was & very virtuous king, He equally possessed
power and forgiveness, and similar opposite qualifications,
He was rich without the coucomitant vices; he equally
favored all, and did nothing that frightened his people,
and was so modest that he felt ashamed when any one
praised him for his good works, He held his mimsterg
under due subjection ; and in disputes he always saon-
ficed his own interest lest he did wrong to others. He
made many clear and just laws. Here,I must end the
description of the virtues of the king for fear of pro
longing my narrative. When building a temple to Tr
bhuvanasvéimi, the house of a tanner fell within the
boundary marked for the temple, but that man would
not give up his house though compensation money was
offered to him, At last when the matter was reported
to the kings the men in charge of the building, and
not the tanner, were held guilty, and they were cen-
sured for want of forethought in having commenced
the building without obtaining the consent of the tanner
in the first instance. They were told either to reduce
the plan of the temple or to build it,eleewhere, for he,
the king, would not commit the sin¢of forcibly taking
another's land. “ For it is our duty,” said he, “to ad-
minister justice, and if we act unjustly who will act
rightly?” At this time there arrived a man rom the
shoe-maker, and was sent to the king by the minister,


--- Page 74 ---
KINGS OF KASHHIRA, 65

This man said, that the shoe-maker wished to see the
king, and if he was held not fit to enter the court, he
requested that he might see the king when at leisure,
and out of his court. Accordingly, on a subsequent day,
the king gave audionce to the shoe-maker when out of
his court, and asked him if he was the obstacle in tie
execution of a pious object, namely, the erection of the
temple, and added that if he thought his house beautiful,
he might have another house still more beautiful, or a
large sum of money. Then the shoe-maker replied—
“Be not prouf, Orking, of your learning and experience,
bub listen to my words according to my judgment. I
Am meaner than a dog, and you are 4 groat king of the
line of Kakutstha, the courtiers will therefore be vexed
to see us talking together. The body of the living 1s
brittle, but is strengthened with pride and affection. As
you love your body, which is adorned with the ornaments
kangkana, héra, and augada, even 80 we love ours though
unadorned. What this handsome palace is to you, that
is my hut to me, though throngh it the sun penetrates.
This hut, like a mother, is witness of my joys and so1-
rows from my birth, and I cannot bear to see it taken
away to-day? Rhe grief which a man feels when his
house 1s taken away from him, can only be known to
the god who is ousted from heaven, or to a king who has
lost his kingdom. Even after all this, if you come to
my house and ask for it, then out of civility I shall give
it up to thee.” The lung went to the shoe maker's house

and bought it. The good are not vain though possessed
of wealth, The shoe-maker clasped his hauds together
and said, that the condescension of the king and the pains
he had taken for the performance of a just act were well
befitting him; and as Virtue had tested Yudhishthira,
a¢é he had tested him, Ie then wished the king a pros.
perous and long life, doing such holy deeds and living
admired by the pious, Thus the sinloss king set up the
image of Vishnu named Tribhuvanasvim{i, Fis queen
*Proakfsha built a large Vibéra nained Pyakdshiké. Mihi
radatta, the spiritual guide of the eking, set up an
image of Vishnu named Gambhirasvdmf{ ; and Chhalitaka,
the mayor of the city, set up a god named Chhalitasvani
for the peace of the town.*

The death of the king occurred owing to some magio
performed by a Bramana,t whom the king had punished
for murder, instigated by his brother Tarépida. It was
from this time‘that the crime of destroying the lives of
superiors by magic began in Kashmfira. When the king
was at the point of death, the Brahmana was brought to
him, but the king would not kill him, saying that he was
innocent, since he was instigated by another. Who does
‘ not feel a pleasure in rememberigg the firgiveness of
this king ? Fate, by a mistake, had sont*him to thia wold
with the Kings of Kaliynga, instead of sending him with
those of the age of Truth. The Bréhmana’s intellect be.

came dull that he had destroyed such a king. This reign,
though short, is replete with many virtuous acts, He
reigned for eight years and eight months,

The fierce and angry Térapida after murdering his
brother sueceeded him. The first act of his reign was
a war with his enemies, whom he defeated with great
slanghter. His prosperity was a source of annoyance to
all. Envious of the gods, and thinking that the Braébma-
nas displayed the glory of the gods, he ceased to punish
guilty Bighmanat in order that they might become cor-
rupt. He reigned for four years and twenty-four days.
JIe too was removed by the magic of « Bréhmana, Man
ties by the same mischief which he devises for others,
just as fire gives out smoke to trouble the eye, but the
same smoke transforms itself into water aud puts ous
the fire.

He was succeeded by his youngest brother Lalitaditya.
He was a very powerful king, and carried on wars against
his neighbours, but did not fight against those who sub-
mitted even at the moment of his victory, People
fled from the cities which ho attacked, and towns
became empty as by miscarriage. Almost the whole of
his reign was spent ‘in conquest. He carried his victo-
rious arms to the cast. He conquered Gddhipura (Kanya-
kuhja) where the women were hunch-backed, Yasho-
varmn, the king of the place, wisely submitted. But
the king’s servants were prouder than the king, even as

the spring. Yashovarmmé unfortunately placed his name
before that of Lalitéditya in the document of the treaty
which was about to be concluded between the two kings;
which ran thus—“ Peace is established between Yasho.
varmmé and Lalitaditya.” This offended Mitrasharma, who
was minister of war and peace, as he regarded it ag
a slight to his master. The king who with his army sag
waiting with impatience, approved of the conduct of his
servant in taking offence, and was so pleased with him

"that he made him head of the five office: which he created
out of eighteen that had existed before and in which
five departments, Shihi and others were made heads. The
five offices are thus named ~- the Great Constabulary, the
Military Department, the great Stable Department,
the Treasury, and the Supreme Executive office. Yasho-
varmma and his family were extirpated. The poets Vék-
pati, Réjashri and Bhavabhuti, &,, who were in the court
of the king of Kéuyakubja, now came over to the king of
Késhmira and used to chant songs to him. Kényakubja,
from the Yamuné to the Kélikg submitted to him even
like the courtyard of his own house.

He marched thence with his aymy towards the eaat,
He passed Kalingga, where elephaats wore caught. And
then he came to Goura, Thence he reached the Eastem
Sea, find pursued his course along the coast towards the
south, conquering as he went. Karndta submitted on
his approach, A beautiful Karnéti lady named Raits

as far a8 the Vindyé hills, also submitted to him. The
aymy then rested on the banks of the Kiverf beneath the
palm trees, drinking the water of cocoanuts, Thence he
marched to Chandanédm. And then the king crossed
the sea passing from oue island to another ; and thence
marched towards the west, the sea singing the songs
of his victory. Ue then attacked the seven Kiamuka
and the seven Kongkana which suffered much thereby.
His army was anxions to enter Dvérakaé situated on the
Western Sea. The army then crossed the Vindyd hills’
and entered Avanti where there was an image of Shiva
named Mahakéla,

Lalitéditya, finding that almost all the kings had been
conquered, turned towards the north, and had to fight
his way with the haughty kings in that divection. He
robbed the king of Kamvoja of his horses. In the
mounting of Bhuskhbéra the horses of the king bacame
excited at the sight of the horse-faced Women of the
country. “He thrice defeated Dussuui and subdued him,
He then conquered the Bouttas, and in whose naturally
pale colored faces no further sign of anxiety was visible.
He also conquered Darad. Ilere the soft wind charged

proached East Yotishupara, the inhabitants left that place.

submitted and came out to have an interview with the
invader, and trembled before him, it {& not certain whether
with fear or inlove. The people of North Kuru fled to
the mountains for fear of Lalitiditya.

Rich with the spoils of conquest the king returned to
hfs country. He gave Jalandhara and Lohara and other
small provinces to his adherents. To mark his conquest,
he obliged other kings to wear a symbol of subjection,
which they bear to this day. The Turashkas commemo-
*yate the fact of their being bound by generally oclasping
both their hands behind their backse and, shaving the
front part of their heads, To prove the inferiority of the
people of the South, he caused them to wear in their
clothes a tail which touched the ground. There was not
a town or village, or island, or river, or sea, where he did
not raise triumphal monuments. These monuments he
named according to the event or the time. When he
set out on his expedition, he felt certain of conquest,
and built a town named Sunishchitapura, or the “ City
of Certainty.” When in his pride of conquest, he built
another named Darpitapura, or the “City of Pride,”
in which he set up an image of Keshava. And when his
conquests were over, and he wassenjoping the fruits of
his victories, he raised another city‘ which he named
Phalapura (phala signifying fruit or effect). He com-
pleted Parnotsa and built a house for amusement named
Krirgrima, the name indicating the purpose’ of the
building, In the kingdom of the femoleg ho set up sn

image of Nrisingha—unsupported by any thing but placed
i, the air between ‘wo loadstones, oue above and one
below. When he was ont in conquest, his viceroy built
a. town after the kiug’s name, but he incurred the king's
anger. In this town of Lalitapura, there was an image
of the sun, to which he bestowed the city of Kanya-
Kkubja with the adjoining lands and villages, At Hushka-
pura he built an image of the god Muktasvamf and built
@ large monastery with a stupa for the Buddhists. He
set out on his conquest with one koti (ten millions) of
eurrent coin. On chis return he bestowed eleven kotis to
Bhutesho for his purification. Ho raised the stonehouse
of Jeshtarndra and bestowod many villages and lands to
it, Healso planted a serics of machinzs o¢ Chokradhara
to draw water from the Vitasté. Also he raised a strong
wall of stone round the temple of the sun. He erected
a town adorned with vines, and another for the spiritual
benefit of the people, and bestowed it withomany villages
to god Vishnu.

Ile built a beautiful town named Parihdsapura. Here
he set up @ silver image of Vishnu, named Shiparihisa-
keshava, and another of gold named, Shrimuktakeshava,
also an image*of Mahgvariéha, the mail of this last image
being made of gol. He also set up a silver image of
Govaidhanadhara, He planted a singla piece of stone
nfty-four cubits high, on which was planted a banner,
on the top of which he set up an image of Garurk. He
likewine built a temple of Buddha, which bad a square

of Muktakeshava was built of eight}-four thousand tolas
of gold, that of Sluiparihdsakeshava was built of
eighty four thousand padas of silver. The image of
Buddha which he set up was built of eighty-four
thousand prasthas of brass. The monastery which had
a square court-yard and the chaitya, were built for
eighty-four thousand piecesof the ourrent coin. The rich
king built gods of gold and silver by the side of the great
‘gods of the country. The jewels, furniture and villages
hastowed on the gods were beyond estimation. His queens,
ministers ond dependent kings also set up hundreds of
wonderful images. His queen named Kamalavati, who
waa very rich, set up a silver image of Vishnu named
Kamalakeshava. His minister Mitrasharma raised an
image of Shiva named Mitreshvara ; and Kayya a
subordinate king of Lita, built a god named Shrikayyas-
vami; he alss erected o vihdrn named Kayyavibéra,
where Sarvvajugamitra a Buddhist attained the purity
of Buddha. Another of his ministers named Tuskhé-
rashchangkuna raised a vihéra named Changkuna, a
stups high aa the mind of a king, and a golden image of
Buddha. Ishdnadevi, wife of the minister“just named,
causeil a canal to be dug, whose waters ‘were clear and be-
neficiol to the healthy as to the sick, Chakramardiké, a
favourite queen of Lalitdditya, built a town named _Chak-

prime minister Changkuna bpilt in another place a vibéra
with a chaitya; and Ishénachandra the physician and
brother to the wife of Changkuna, having obtained
wealth through the favor of Takshaka, built a Vibéra.*

The king further caused a permanent asylum for tle
pogr to be built at Parihésnpura, to which he presented
one lake and oue plates filled with food. He also caused
a town to be builé in a barren place that thursty men
might find watey there. He invited prudent men from”
other countrigs, end brought Changkuna brother of
Kangkanavaxsha, an alchymist, from Bhuskhdra. Tho
king exchanged with this man a statne of Buddha
which he brought from Magadha for certain jewels

Tho king who was a good horseman, onco rode to the
woods to break a new horse. There, in a solitary part of
the forest, he found a beautiful woman singing, and an-
other dancing. When they had finished their works,
they bowed aud went away. The king for some days
continually went%p the same place, riding on the same
horse, and saw the same sight. One day, being questioned

one else say more as to why the temple is invisible.”
The king heard this and caused the place, pointed out
Dy them, to be dug. After an excavation had been made,
the king on being informed by the diggers, came there
and saw a dilapidated temple with closed doors, And
when the doors were opened, he found two old images
“of Keshava, and an inscription to the .effect that they
wero built by Rima and Lakshinana. By the side of
the temple of Parihgsakeshava, the king built a separate
house of stone where he placed Rémasvam{, one of
those two statues, His qheen Chakramardiké asked
for the other statue Lakehmanasvimi from the king, and
placed it beside Chakresh vara.

When the king set out in his wars, a man with fresh
wounds laid himself down before the elephant on which
the king rode, His hands were scratched, and his nose
wounded and bleeding, and he begged hard to be saved,
The kind-hearted king asked what had happened to him.
He replied that he was the faithful minister of the king
of the sandy Sindhu, and that,he was beaten by the
king because he advised him to subinit to Lalitéditya.
The king of Késhmfra determined to chastise the king
of Sindhu, and caused good surgeons to attend on the
exminister, The ex-minister told the king that after
suffering the injury he had received, he did not care to

KINGS OF KAsmarfra, 7h

live, except for the sake of vengeance, and that when he
was revenged, it was fitting that he should die, bidding
farewell to the joys and griefs of this world. “ But it is
meet,” said he, “that I should injure him more than
he has injured me. How can you,” he then continued,
“reach that country sooner than in three months, or
reaghing his country, bow will you maintain yourself
agninst him? I will show you a way by which you can
reach that country in half a month, but no water can be
had by that route, so you will have to carry water for your °
army. My frignds there will giveno alarm of your ap-
proach, so you will be able to capture the king with his
ministers and his females.” Thus saying, he led the king’s
army and entered a sandy desert. When fifteen days
were past, the store of water became exhausted, Still
the king pressed on for two or three days more, but
finding that the soldiers were suffering from want of
water, he said to the guide that more days had passed
in the way thon he had mentioned, and that the soldiers
wera almost dying for want of water. He then asked
how much of the way was yet remaining. Then replied
the guide smiling, “Askest thou of the way to the
country of yur smajesty’s enemy, or to that of Death ?
For the benefit of thy master I have disregayded my life,
aud have devised this plan, and have brought you
and your army to the way of death, This is uot
merely s barren place, but a terrible sea of sand,
no ~water can be had here, who will save you

to-day?” Hearing this speech, the whole army became
motionless like a shali crop destroyed by hail stones,
The king heard the lamentations of the frightened soldiors
and lifted his hand to stop their cries and snid, “Tam
glad, O! minister, to see your devotion to your master,
Vout on me your deception is in vain, as the blow of the
iron on the stone Vajramani ; and you will now grieve for
your falsehood as one does who grasps flame mistaking
it for a jewel, As the sound of & thunder opens the
“Vidura ground, so look at my order waters will spring
from wndorneath tho ground.” The king then began to
dig the carth with a dunia; and as Shiva with his spear
made the Vitasté flow, there he brought out from pétdla,
ariver the life-hope of his soldiers, which relievod thom.
The ex-minister of the king of Sindhu, his labours now
heing abortive, aud wounded as he was, returned to tho
country of his master, whero Death entered after him ; for
the king of Kashmiva defeated the wily king of Sindhu,
yeduced him to the condition in which his minister had
appeared before him, and devastated his country. The
river Kuntavahini, which the king struck out in the
desert, and which ran according to the wants of the king
through various tracts, is still fowipg in, Utiargpatha.
Though there ore thousands of wonderful anecdotes
of this king, I do not narrate them for fear of Jengthen-
ing the history. Time and country give some traits to the
character even of the great; as even noiseless and deep
rivers clatter when passing over rocks, and their clear

KINGS OF KASHM{RA. qT

water is turned muddy in the rainy season, Iq it the
fault of Kaliyuga, or of the throne that even this prince
showed some bad traits in his character?

Once, when dwelling at Parihgsapurn in the company
of hig women and intoxicated with wine, he told his mini
ters thatif they wished 10 increase the beauty of his city,
they should burn Pravarapura, the city built by king
Pravarasena. His orders could not be disobeyed, and
the ministers hurried to the place and set fire to the
dry grass and heaps of grain at Vituldnaka. The king
saw from his ‘palace the burning flames and laughed
loudly, Even good man, when filled with envy, sees
things belonging to others, as more plentiful than they
really ara;as the eye afflicted with Timira sees moon
&¢., double. For if it were not so, why should this
king, who built numberless cities, consider the single
one built by Pravarasena to be fit 10 4e destroyed.
But when-he became sober he grieved at the sin
committed in burning the town. Grief in the heart
corrodes the body as long as life remains, like fire within
the hollow of a dried-up tree. On the morning when
his ministers yaw him repenting, they removed his grief
by assuring him that “they did not burn the town, The
king waa glad to learn this fact, as one is fo see his son
whom in dream he thought he had lost. He then
praised” his ministers, ond instructed them not to obey
him, when he issued orders under the influence of wine.
The world is like a woman of the town, and the king

like her temporary lover. Vie te those who for their
own pleasure want to please ‘such a king ; but those who
disregarding life, prevent the king from following a wrong
way, hallow the world.

“ On another occnsion the king aasured the king of
Gaura of his safety by the god Shr{parihd4sakeshaya, but
afterwards caused him to be murdered by wicked men
ut Trigrimi. Tho people of Gaura were then very
” powerful, and for the death of their king they were ready
to give up their lives. Some of thom entered Késhmira
under the pretence of visiting Sarasvati, and having
collected thomaelvos into a body besieged the temple of
Parihésakeshava, The king was not then in the city,
and the priosts seeing that they intonded to get an
entrance, shut up the gates of the temple. On tho other
hand the people of Gaura seeing Ramasvaémi, whose
temple stoot by the side of the other, built of silver,
and mistaking it to be Parihisakeshava, tore it from its
seat and broke it to atoms, scattering the pieces on every
side. They were, however, overtaken by the soldiers who
were in the city, and were killed at avery step, They
were cut to pieces—their sable hodies esmeared with
blood fell on the ground. Thus they died nobly for tha
Jovecof their king, What cannot gallant men do? They
come all this distance, and perished for the death of
their king. Even Vidhitd connot exhibit such keroism.
And at thot age kings had several such devoted and
powerful servants. The favourite god Parihdsakeshave


--- Page 88 ---
KINGS OF KASEMinA, 79

was thus saved by the destruction of Rimasvimi. The
place of the latter is vacant to this day, but the glory
of tho heroes of Gaura fills the whole world.

Thus passed the days of the king; the greater part
of his reign was spent outside his kingdom. Anxioys
to see no one but himself king in the world, he again led
an* expedition against Uttardpatha. The orders of this
king were obeyed in realms where the sun did not shine,
The ministers for a long time had no intelligence ofs
him, and tho thessengers whom they had sent returned
with tho folldwing’ message from the king.—“ What o
mistake it ison your part to expect my return when [
have entered these regions? What business have I to
enter my own kingdom leaving behind the new kingdoms
which I conquer every day? The river issuing from its
source terminates in the sea, but the career of him whe
conquers for the sake of conqnest has no termination,
Tam instructing you what you have to do, and reign
accordingly. Let not the great men of the country effect
& quarrel among you, for like atheists they have no fear
of the future world. The people who dwell in tha caves
of mountaingghould be punished even without fault, for
if they cau get nroney and fortify themselves they will
turn out formidable. Let not the villagers geg grain
more than would suffice them for one year, and let them
have Yo more bullocks than what is required for cultiva-
ting their Inds, for if they gain mote than they require
for the year, these cruel Dimaras will heoome powerful

enough to set aside the orders ef the king, and shall
become strong before the sovereign can know of if,
When the villagers have clothes, wives, eatables, elephants,
ornaments, horses and houses like the citizens; when
lings neglect to watch important forts; when they are
not able to kuow the hearts of their servants ; when the
jigeers are granted to soldiers in one district only; when
the Kéyasthas are united to one another by marringe;
‘when kings see their officers behaving like Kéyasthag ;
then you will know for certain that, the people’s lot is
going to be changed for the worse, After careful con-
sideration follow my advice, and let not outsiders know
of this, As by scent the nearness of an elephant is
known, and by lightuing that of the thunder-clap, so
by osre the heart of man can be ascertained. My sons
Kuvalaysditya and Vajraditya are the same to me, but
being born ofrdifferent mothers, there is difference in
their intellect. The elder should be anointed when he
is atrong, still if it be necessary you may disobey his or-
ders. If he leaves his kingdom, or commits suicide,
remember my words, let none of you be grieved. My
younger son you should not raise to the-throne, or if
you do never disobay him. And thouga he be oppressive
still you should guard him. To my youngest grandson,
the boy Jaygpira, yor should always say, ‘ba Hike your
grandfather.’ ”
The ministers, understanding his purpose and’ despgit
ing of hia xeturn, bowed to his orders and wept, One

day Changkuna after much wooping said to the poople—
“ Anoint Kuvalayépfra, for jhe king is dead.” Ile learnt
the fact by magic ; for though the minister was at o dis-
tauce yet by force of good fortune he could accomplish
diffioult things, Although the sun be clouded, yet expands
the lotus ; though the clouds be at a distance, yet they coc!
the sunbeams. The great have some secret powers, not
apparent to others, by which they oan effect difficult
things from a distance. The king died after a reign of
thirty-six years, gevon months and eleven days. Some —
aay he perished at Aviyéoaka by an untimely fall of heavy
snow. Some again maintain that in order to keep up hig
glory he burnt himself when in a danger. Aga, there
are othors who are of opinion that he with his army
entered the abodes of the gods through Uttargpatha.
As the history of the acts of this king is strange, s0 also
is the history of his death. When the sun sots, some
say he enters the sea, others any he entérs into fire,
some again say, that ho goes to another world. Even so
when the great are dead ihe tidings of their death pro-
clam their creatness.

Lalitaditya was succeeded by Kuvalayapira born of
queen Kamalattev{, He ennobled his royalty by charity,
aa the serpent brightens his skin by casting off his old
slough. Wis reign was fora short time darkened by bis
quarrel with his equally valiant brother. The quarrel
for sore time remained undecided owing to their depend-
auts very often changing sides for money. At last the


--- Page 91 ---
82 finas oF KASHMiRA,

king ovarcame his younger brother and also the depend.
ants who took money from both'sides. Now, having
maintained peace in the kingdom, and gaining strength,
he was ambitious of making foreign conquests. But at
this time one of his ministers, either remembering the
instructions of the late king, or through pride, disobeyed
Kuvalayépira ; at which he was so angry that he conld
not at night sleep even for 1 moment, and thought not
, only of killing him but several of his partisans. But
afterwards when his anger was assuaged, he wondered
how he had ever thought it fit to take so many lives,
And he thus questioned himself“ Who ever lives in
pence ofter committing crimes for the sake of solf?
What reasonable man wants to violate the path of
virtue for his ungrateful person? None takes notice
of the changes time brings on him. The immortal
beings laugh at us, for they found us yesterday thought-
lessly laughing in childhood ; to-day they see our
beards grown and our faces looking red like’ copper in
angers; and to-morrow they will behold our counten-
anca and hair disfigured like the head of an old
goat.” Thus thinking on the mutability of man,
and valuing peace, he left his kingdenand went into
the woods of Plakshaprasravana. At the time of his
depafture he wrote on his seat the following line which
show his aaceticism— Go to the woods, fix your mind in
devotion, for the riches you see are perishable, and of
shark duration.” This seat-king may be seen by -tha

good even to this day at Shri hill and other places.
When the son of his master; thus left the kingdom, the
minister Mitrasharmmg with his wife drowned himself
for grief in the waters of Vitasté. This king reigned
for one year and fifteen days.

Him succeeded his brother Vajriditya also called
Vappiyaka or Lalitéditya, born of queen ‘Chakramardika.
The cruel temper of this king contrasted strangely with
the gentle character of his brother. He robbed Parihs-
sapura of many gifts with which his father had adorned
it. This luzuzious sing had many females in his zanona.
He sold many people to the Miechobhas, and introduced
their evil habits, After reigning seven years this vicious
king died of consumption, the effect of his debauchery.

His son Prithivyspira by queen Mangjariké then came
to the throne, He was a great persecutor of his subjects,
and reigned for four years and one month.

He was dethroned by his step brother Sanggramépira
born of queen Masag. This prince reigned only seven
lays, These two kings did not benefit the kingdom.

After the death of Sangevémépira, Jayépira the youngest
son of Vappiya or Lalitdditya, ascended the throne.
This prince Temembered the words of the ministers,
“Be like your grandfather,” whioh they used to repeat
to him according to the direction of king Lalitéditya I,
and being ambitious of conquest, he collected an army
and set cut of his country. Arriving at the gato of
Kéchmira with his feudatory chiefs, he asked the old


--- Page 93 ---

84 KINGS OF RAstMina,

men there as to tho numerical strength of the army
with which his grandfather had set out. The old men
smiled and said, “ What is the use of asking that ques.
tion? For that which was then accomplished cannot be
yepeated again, He had one lok and twenty-five thousand
litters of war with him, while you have only eighty
thousand.” But the king did not think the conquest of
the world difficult with the army he had collected, na he
thought times had much changed since the days of
his grandfather. The old men found én him the spirit
of his grandsixe. When the king’ had gone far ont
of his country, his wife's brother rebelled and aseended
the throne of KAshmfra. Ou the other hand, many
soldiers who had not much loyalty in them, and
longed for home, daily deserted his army and returned
to their country. Thus deserted, yet resolved to show
his personal yalor, the king made a solemn vow. Through
his pride which was not yet humbled, he surmounted
the frowns of fortune. Sending his feudatory kings
who followed him, to their respective countries, he- with
o few followers went to Prayéga. There having nscer-
tained the number of his horses, he presented one lak
minus oue to BrShmanas with rick offgeiaga. And there
on the bonks of the Ganges he erected a monument
marked with his name, and an inscription to the effect
that he who should be able to present one lak of horses
might pull down Jaygpfira’s monument, and erect his
own, The Gauges still laves with its waters the monu

ment marked with the name of Jayfpirn, He then
oxdered his soldiers to votun home, and separating him-
self from them, wont out alone one night, and entered
the city of Paundravardhana, the possession of Jayanta,
the king of Gaura.

Long peace had made the citizens rich which it gave
him delight to see. The king know dancing, and natur-
ally enough wished to see a dance, and entered the
temple of Karttikeya. Fora time he sat on a stone
at. the door of the temple. Ie had an air of majesty
in him which, the people perceived and wondered, and
they moved aside from him. It so happened that the
dancing gizl Kamala saw with wonder the beautiful
king, and his uncommon mein. She also marked thot
he frequently touched his shoulders and concluded that
he muat be some great man travelling over the world
in disguise. ‘May be,” she thought, “he is a king
or a king’s son or born of some high family who is
ncoustomed to take betel from behind him, since he is
frequently touching his back. The elephant shakes his
eava though there be no black bees, the lion looks behind
as he goes though there be no elephant near, the peacock
dances though™ tke clouds be dispersed; thus habit
makes one work though there be no cause for so work-
ing.” Thus thinking she made a sign to a bosom friend
of hers, bidding her to approach the king; and when he
placed his hand on his back as before, Kamald’s friend
plated a betel there, which the king took, and

putting it to his mouth looked back and saw her. He
asked her by a movementa of his eyebrows who sha
was, Sho replied his question, He was pleased with

her sweet conversation ; and when the dance was over,

she accompanied him to Kamalé’s house, The king was
‘Strack with Kamalaé’s courteous behaviour, her tender-
ness and beauty. Now when the moon had risen, she
took her guest by the hand, and led him to her bed
voom., There lying on a golden couch, the girl, drunk
with Maireya wine, practised her arts ow the king, but he
did not touch her, And when shc bacame ashamed of
her forwarduess, the king clasped her to his bosom, and
vently said: “It is not, O | beauteous-eyed, that you
have not touched my heart, but owing to my present
misfortunes I am obliged to offend thee by not respond-
ing to your caresses. J am your servant, your simplicity
hos bought me, and you will soon know my history, and
then excuse me. Kauow that I have vowed not to enjoy
pleasures till J have done my task.” So saying he played
a tune with his fingers on the couch, and sighed and re-
cited a verse; “ Whose lust of conquest is not satisfied,
can he think of woman? The sun does not come to his
spouse in the evening without «congatéring the whole
world.” When he had finished the recitation, the girl
took him to be some great man. On the morning when
the king was about to depart, Kamalg requested him
not to go, and gave him a lodging in her house’ ,
Once the king went ont to a riverside to perform his
evening prayer, and it was late when he returned, and

KINGS OF Risnmira, 87

found the whola household extremely anxious on his
ageount, When he Asked the cause of their anxiety,
Kamalé smiled and said:—" At night there comes a
great lion which kills many lives ; day by day it destroys
man, elephant, horse, and you being late we were
apprehensive of your safety. Be he king or prince, no
one stirs from his house at night." Theking smiled at
her tale. That night passed, the king went out of the
city next evening, and waited beneath a large Banyan
tree for the lion. From a distance he spied the animal
looking like tho vary smile of Yama moving about,
Ife shouted in order to draw the attention of the beast,
and at that deafoning noise, the lion yelled and ap-
pronebod, his mane shaking, his eyes burning, and his
ears erected. He lifted up the forepart of his body and
opened his mouth, The active king thrust his hand up
to the elbow into the mouth of the lion, and cut inside
his chest. The lion vomited blood and*died of that
single sivoke. The king washing his blood, and hiding
the wound in his elbow, slept as before in the house of
Kamalg, Jn the morning kiny Jayante heard that the
lion had been Killed, and urged by curiosity, went out to
see it. There beheld the huge carease of the animal
killed by one singlo person, and felt sure that he who

had destroyed it was more than man. He waa, however,

surprised when a follower of his gave him a Aeyure,

fan orvament worn on the upper arm] taken out from the

mouth of the lion, marked with the name of Shrijayzpira.

How came he here? Asked the king, and tho city became
alarmed at the information. After assuaging the fears
of the citizens, king Jayanta thus addressed them—
“Why are you afraid, Q men of little sense, now that
you should be glad? It is rumoured that for certain
Teasons the powerful king Jaydpira is travelling in the
world alone under the false name of prince Kallata,
I have no son,” continued the king of Gaura; “and am
resolved to marry my daughter Kalydénadevi to him,
* He ought to be sought after, and if he.be found without
sceking, it will be as one who seeks for jewels and finds
the island where there are all precious stones. He must
be in thiy city, and he who will be able to givo any
information about him will obtain in return whatever ho
desires.” Tho citizens, trusting in the word of their
truthful king, made search after Joyapira, and at Inst

ping in the “house of Kamalé. The king with his
ministers and his ladies came to the place, and with due
attention conveyed him to his palace, And then he
married him to Kalyénadevi. Jayégpiza then subdued
the five kings of Gaure, and made his father-in-law para-
mount over them. The army which b>“iind left behind
under the command of Devasharmm{é, the son of Mittra-
sharramé, the minister of his grandfather, joined him:
and at the request of his general he returned to his
country with his wife and Kamalé. On his way he

defeated the king of Kényakubja, and took away from
him his splendid throne.

When he entered Kashmira, his brother-inlaw Jajja,
‘who had usurped his throné, came out against him, An
obstinate battle was fought for several days at the village
of Pushkaletra. During these days the dwellers of the
villages and forests who could uot brook the usurper,
flocked to Jayaépira, who was beloved of his subjects.
Im the course of the battle, one Shrideva, a villager,
and a Chandéla by caste, sought for Jajja. They pointed
out tohim Jayja viding on horseback in the thick of,
the battle, but"being thirsty he was drinking water
from a golddu vessel. “Now Jajja is killed by me,”
cried ont Shiideva as he struck him with a atone tied to
a pling, When he had set out for battlo, he had said
to his mother that he was gong to help the king, and
had asked for food. His mother laughed, but he resolved
to kill Jajja. Jajja’s army seeing him struck down to tho
ground with stone, and motionless, lef him dying.
Thus he reigued for three years in the kingdom which he
gained by rebellion. He lived in anziety, drending the
arrival of his powerful foe. The riches of merchants last
not, if they appropriate what is entrusted to them, nor
of prostitutes, if they deceive their paramours nor of
kings, if they g%t tie kingdom by rebellion, After the
death of Jajja, Jayéptca reigned, aud by his good works
he attracted the hearts of the good. His queen Kalyéna-
devi ‘ounded a town named Kalyénapura on the field
of her ‘husband's victory. The king founded a city ;
named Mahlguapura, and set up a large image of Keshava, |

and Kamala alao raised a city named Kamals after her
name. -
The king made several improvements in the kingdom,
He introduced such sciences as were long forgotten in
the country, even as Kashyapa brought the Vitasté, and
encouraged his subjects to cultivate learning. He invited
Jeorned men from other countries and employed them
jm collecting the fragments of Pétanjali’s commentary
<on the annotations of Katyéyana on Panini’s gramma-
tical aphorisms. Tho king himself used to take les.
sons from Keshfra, a Professor of Gfammsr. He never
liked nor tolerated self-praise, but valued the praise
uf the leamed. The title of pandita was more prized
in his reign than that of the king. He listened to
whatever learned men said, and so the inferior kings
who had any favor to ask crowded in the houses of the
Jearned. Such was his assiduity to get together learned
men, that men of lore became scarce in the courts
of other kings. In Shukradanta’s house of charity,
where boiled rice was distributed, one learned man
named Thakriya was made the head. Anothor learned
man named Udbhatabhatta was made the president
of his court on a daily pay of ofle le OF dinéras, He
taade Dimoduragupta a poet, who had the art of pro-
curing women, his principal minister, The poets of
his court were Moanoratha, Shangkhadatta, Chataka and
Sandhimgua; and his ministers were Vamana and others.
Once the king dreamt, when in deep sleep, that the


--- Page 100 ---
KINGS oF KAsuufra, 91

sun was rising from the west, and he know thereby that
some virtuous panditas had entered his kingdom. This
noble and eloqueit king appreciated learning in which he
took so great a pleasure. What joys can those kings feel,
who, like blind bulls, are bent only on satisfying their,
appetites. As the embrace of the wife who is determined
to follow her Jord to the other world, is to the dead
when placed on the funeral pyre; as the juico of the
sugarcane is to one who has lost his taste by Mahkdmoha ,
disease; as the stent of the garland is to the dead;
even so is the granddur of learning to the senseless,

The king once ordered one of his messengers to get five
Rékshasas from Ceylon. The messenger who was nono
other than his minister for war and peaco, fell over-
board the vessel, and was swallowed by a Timi fish ; but
he tore the bowels of the fish and reached the shore.
Vibhishana, king of Ceylon, gave him five Riékshasns.
and sent him back to his country. The king bestowed
much wealth on the messenger, and caused the Réksha-
sos to fill up a deep tank, and build a fort named Jayapura
which equalled heaven in beauty. The king set up
threa large images of Buddha, a monastery, and an
image of a godatss flamed Jayadevi in that town. Ho
also set up images of Rama and his brothers, and of
Vishnu reposing on a snake, Some say that the king
caused, the tank to be filled up by his workmen, and
employed the Rikshasas in doing some other work. Once
the king dreamt that Vishnu asked him to cause a city

92 RINGS of KAsHifRa,

like Dvgravatf to be built surrounded by water, and he
built a town so surrounded, which the people, even to

, this day, call Abhyantarajayapura, In this city, Jayadeva,
who was at the head of the five departments [mentioned
pefore] built a monastery; and A’cha, the son-in-law of
Pramoda the king of Mathurd, who was subject to the
king of Késhmfra, set up an image of Mahédeva nained
A’cheshvara.

+ ‘The king again set out for conquest. He had a large
army with him ; his elephants appeared“as a continuation
of hills as far os the sen, and his ‘army‘stretohed from
the Himélaya to the Hastern Hills. At night Summuni-
raja, and others with the Chandilas kept watch over the
army. Tha king adopted the name of Vinayaditya and
founded a city in the east named Vinayadityapura,

Kings may be great ond brave and persevering, yet
sudden. dangers often render their fortunes doubtful,
Once disguised as 4 hermit, the king entered the fort
of Bhimasena, king of the Hnst. He was, however, recog-
nized by Siddha, brother of Jajja, and understanding
that the king had come as % spy, he gave information
to Bhimasena, who, all of a audden, captured and confined
him, Here fate overcame the effotts (t man. J: ayépira,

of Euphorbia] he produced eruptions on his body. Now
the guards reported to Bhimasena that tho king of Kash"
mirp had an attack of what they thought to be the
prevailing disease, ond Bhimasena apprehending danger
therefrom, gent out Jayépira. Thua effecting his escape,
he onptured the fgrt.
Aramuri, the loaraed and wily king of Nepéla, wished
to engage himself in war with Jayépira. When the
king of Kashmfra entered Nepéla, Aramuri collected bis
army, and without submitting retired before the army of
Kishmira, Jayéplra not caring to fight with other kings,
pursued Aramuri through various countries like a falcon
that follows a pigeon, sometimes gaining and sometimes
losing sight of his enemy's army. Having conquered
the countries around, he encamped with his soldiers by
the side of a river that flows into the sen within a short
distance, Thenee he continued his march towards the
Hastern Sea for two or three days, his banners flying in
the breeze Winch, came from the sea, After which he
got within sight of the Nepdéla army encamped on the
southern bank of the river, under the Nep&la umbUrelle.
The anger of Jayépira was roused at the sight of the
army ofthe enemy, and on hearing thei notes of war,
Awd finding that the water in tho river was only knee-

deap, and not knowing the nature of the place, he
descended into the river. When le had gone half way,
the flood tide came in, and immensely increased the bulk
of the water, the place beiug near the sea. His army
consisting of men, négas, horses, elephants, were borne
way by the current, The king's ornaments and clothes
were swept away, and ho was carried by the stream to
a great distance, but he kept himself above water by
awimming, The cries and shrieks of the army, mixed
“with the xoar of the waters, filled all sides, At this
opportunity the king was quickly -picked up by the
enemies by means of leather bag, and thus to their grent
joy he was captured, The favors of Fortune aud of clouds
own no law, for Fortune often bestows great favors, but
in the next moment causes mishap; and clouds, while
assuaging the heat of a long summer day, hurl down
thunderbolts. The king of Nepila confiued him in a
high stone-built house on the banks of the Kélagandiké,
and appointed hig fuithfol guards to watch over him.
The king of Kashufra once more in danger, and not
knowing what to do, burnt with grief. The confinement
was 80 strict that neither the moon nor the sun could
sechim. But by some meaus he agw the*tiie river was
nigh, and he planned his escape. Even to this day the
kind-hearted pandiias remember the lines which the
King then composed regarding his condition.
Devasharmms, the proud minister of Késhmirn, was
grieved to think of the humiliation of the king, and de-

termining to roscue his master at the risk of his life, sent
a,awaet-tongued messenger to Aramuri, and offered to
give up to the king of Nepdla the wealth and the king-
dom of Jaydpira, And when messengers from Nepdla
came io him, and arrangements were made, he with the
Kashmirian army entered Nepdln. He reached thé
Keélggandiké, left his army on its banks, and crossed
the river with only a few followers. He was introduced
into the Nepila court by the feudatory kings, and was
well received by fhe king who caused him to sit down
in his presenge. But as he was weay with travelling,
the king soon dismissed him, Devasharmmé came to his
lodgings and there passed the remainder of tho day.
On the next day, he and the king after drinking retired
to privacy to sottle their affairs, The minister told the
king of Nepéila that the accumulated wealth of Jaydpira
was with the army, the fact being known to the king
of Késbmfra alone, and to some of his faithful officers,
“T wish fo hear from the king of Kashmfra,” continued
the minister, “where he has kept these trensures, by
holding out to him the hope of his being set freo if he
would give them up. I have not therefore brought the
army here, Toa, they to whom. the riches are entrusted
be with the army, it will be impossible to get the
treasures. Butif the soldiers be brought here one by
one and seized they may give out the secret.” Thus
deceiving the king of Nepéla, he with the King’s permis-
sion went to Jayépira. He was grieved to see the king,

minister, “and then come alone and you will see the
plan I propose to cross the river, and follow it without
fear.” The king then retired and passed the usual time
out of the room, then entering it alone he found his mi-
nister lying dead on the ground, with a picce of cloth tied
round his neck; and on it was written the following
wentence—* TI am but dead to-day, my body is stuffed
with air, and will be for you a leather bag which will not
break ; ride on me and cross the river. I have tied s

of his body, which he had talen out with his nails.

other princes.

Unfortunately for his subjects, the king left the path
of his grandsire, and walked in that of his father. The
Kéyasthas advised him that it was useless to undergo the
fKtigues of foreign conquest when he could accumulate
wealth in his own country. The king took their advice,
and began to oppress his subjects. Shivadésa and others
of his treasurers excited his oupidity. henceforth ho

adopted for the oppression of the people. He murdered
mavy persons; and excepting those who flattered him,

kings both confmit sins: the one cruelty ond the other

as the king began to kill many of them; but at last they
gombined and stood together, and the king could not
dastroy them, though ho continued to plunder them.
The kiug’s character was greatly changed, and he was
spoken ill of iu poetry by the panditas, The cracl king
once ordered that ninety-nine Bréhmanas should ba
Killed in one day. And when he was sitting on the banks
of the Chandrabhigé after having forcibly taken posses-
sion of Tulamula, he was informed that ninety-nine
Bréhmanas had, perished in the waters of that river.”
From that time he, ceased to take possession of Jands
granted to Bréhmanas, but he continued to take posses-
sion of those possessed by men of other castes.

The Bréhmanas who dwelt at Tulamula once came
to say something to the king, but were struck in his
presence by his door-keeper, and consequently were
very angry. “Brgimanas were never insulted before,
even in the presence of Manu, Mandhgté, Rama and
other great kings;” they said, ‘and when angry they
can destroy ina moment the heavon with Indra, the
earth with her mountains, and the nether world with
its Nzga—chief.” The king who would not ask for advice,
and was deserted by his feudatory kings, replied with
supercilious pride, “You cunning people who eat by
begging, what pride is this of yours that you presend to
do what the Rishis did.” The Bréhmauns were cowed
down * by his frown, but one Titti thus replied: “Wa

king, even so we are Rishis.” The king scornfully
enquired: “Art thou the great Rishi Vishvidmitra o
Vashishta or Agastha?’ And, as if flaming with anger,
the other replied, “If you be Harishchandra, Trishanku
or Nahusha, then Iam one of those you mention.” Tha
fing then anawered with aamule, “ the curse of Vishvémitra
and others destroyed Harishchandra, &., what will your
anger effect?” The Bréhmana struck the earth with
his hand, and said, “ will not my anger bring down

“lot full the Brahmadanda, why+ delay it longer?”
“0 cruel man,! there it falla.”” And no sooner had Litti
said so than a golden bar from the canopy fell on the
king. The wound degenerated into erysipelatous in-
flammation, and insects generated on the suppuration,
He suffered great pain, the sample of what he would
have to suffer in hell. After five nights, he, who had
courted danger, died. Thus the king who used to
punish without fault, was chastised by Brahmadanda
and perished. This powerful though fickle king reigned
for thirty one years. Kings thirsting for wealth, and
restrained by no limits, take to evil ways, like the fishes
which thirating for muddy water lenve Paeir’place and go
on the dry land. The latter are caught by fishermen, ond
the former are sent tohell. His mother Amritaprabhé set
up a god named Amritakeshava for the salvation of his soul.

to royal duties, and in his reign prostitutes obtained
influence, and evil ways ware prevalent, The ill-gotten
wealth of his father was spont by him on dancers,
_ actors, &o. Bad men gained access to the palace
ag friends of prostitutes, and taught him the art of
pleasing the public women. The king cast aside his’
croyn and royal ornaments, and lived in the company
of females, Those who could joke and speak of women,
were his favorites, not warriors or learned men. His
passion inoreased, with his enjoyments, and he thought
his fathor was inanimate, because when he conquered the
kingdom of women, he did not touch them. And
pleased with the embraces of women, aud surrounded by
his temporary companions, he laughed at his ancestors wha
had felt a passion for conquest. The king rewarded his
gay compauions because they derided old mon so og to
prevent them from approaching the king. In his court,
aud accompanied by his courtezans, the king shamed his old
ministera with loud laughter and jokes. The wicked king
clothed his noble ministers with clothes marked with the
foot-print of prostitutes. One proud minister named
Aanoratha, unable to reform the king, ceased to attend his
cuurt, There is,no yay left bui to desort a bad king,
for it is nseless to oppose him or to conour with him, or to

Jayeshvara. The wealth saved by parsimonious kings
is soon squandered by some successor. The king spent
but a small” sum, but his uncles appropriated the
whole. The wealth which their sister had gained by
means of her beauty was now spent by her fortunate
brothers. But as their nephew grew up, they appre

could not agree in their choice, and so they quarrelled.
Nribhuvanapira, son of king Vappiya by queen Meghévali,
though the eldest, was not crowned, because all did not
agree. This Tribhubanapira’s son named Ajitépira by
Jayédevi, was raised to the throne by Utpala in opposi-
tiog to his colleagues. But the king could not please
all the five brothers equally, for when he spoke to one
of them the rest were displeased. ‘The flve brothers who
appropriated tha revenues of the realm, set up many
houses of gods in the city. They with their sons ruled
the kingdom which may bo said to have been without
a king, Utpala set up a god named Utpalasvim{, and
built a town named Utpalapure. Padma set up a god
named Padmasvém{, and a town named Padmapura,
The wife of Padma named Gunndevi, built two temples,
one within the city, and the other at Vijayeshvara.
Dharmma set up a god named Dharmmaavém{, and
Kalyguavarmma set up Kalydnasvami, an image of
Vishnu. Mamma set up o god Mammasvémf, and gave
away as gift eighty-five thousand cows with calves, and
five thousand dinfras with each cow and calf, Who
can estimate his wealth, much tess the accumulated
wealth of all the brothers? Their charity made every
one desire and pray for their riches, by whatever ‘means
acquired, whether by plunder or by honest means. The
houses of the gods built by them were far larger than
other temples which stood beside them. From the

ter obeyed the orders of the king, and the king complied
with the requests of tho minister. The king was forgiv-
ing and grateful, the minister devoted to his master,
and without vanity. Such a union is rave. The wise king,
although he had obtained a kingdor, did, not forget his
past condition and used to meditate in the following
mannor :——" The regal dignity inspires ambition in great
minds, and leads men to crime. There is none who is
favored with royal dignity but feels misery in the ond.
How oan she (Fortune) who rose from the ocean along with
the courtesaus of heaven, learn io be faithful to one. She
has no affection, and has followed no king to the other

ing vessels of departed kings no Jonger belong to them!
Why do not kings feel ashamed to ent from plates from
which others have eaten before them ? Who does not fear
to lool: on the huge plates of silver maxked with the names
of departed kings? Who oan feel pleasure at tho sight of
those unholy necklaces which have been taken out from
the necks of dying kings? And who does not feel terri-
fied to touch these ornaments left by them: with their

Wealth is purified whon bestowed on proper persons,”
‘Thus thinking, the king broks the golden ornaments and
things, and gave them to Brihmanas, One Brahmana
instead of saying, “admirable O! king,” when he re-
ceived the gift, addressed him by name and said “ admir-
able O! Avanti!” Tho king was so pleased at this that
he bestowed much wealth on him. The king gave away
everything in charity retaining only his Chdémara and
umbrella, and thus he spent the accumulated wealth of
his predecessors.

His brother and brather’s son rose against him several
times, but he defeated them in battle, and having res-
tored peace in his kingdom, he divided his wealth among
his friends and servants, out of affection towards them.
Out of his affection too for his step-brother Stravarmmé
he raised him to the dignity of heir-apparent. This
Siravarmma bestowed the villages of Khadhuyg and

The minister Shiva patronized learning and encouraged

court in royal carriages drawn hy pair, and were well
reecived. The following authors flourished in this
reign :—Muktékana, Shivasyimi, A’‘nandavardhana and
Ratnékara, Kritamandéra the bard of the minister
Shéva used to repeat the following sloka in the court
as a hint to his master. “This ia the time to do
good, while fortune lasts, for fortune is naturally fleeting,
and danger fs always at hand, and when danger comes,
there will be no more opportunity to do good.” Shira
raised many eilifices, and among others one for Hara-
Pérvat{, a igure half male and half female, at the shrine
Sureshvari, This temple was very strongly built. And bay-
ing set up the god Shirashvara, he built the temple Shara-
matha, as high ag his own mansion, for the dwelling of
devotees. He built & beautiful town named Shdérapma
and brought there the celebrated dram which was ia
Kramavartia. Ratvavardhana, his son, set up an image

of Shiva named Bhiiteshvara at Sureshvarf, and built o
matha within the eiclosure of Shiramatha. Kavya-
dovi, his wife, set up a Shiva named Kivyadevishvara at
Sureshvari,

The king who had no vanity in him, allowed his
brothers and Shira and Shéra’s sons to bear the royal »
arms. The king was from his childhood a Vishnuvite,
but out of regard for Shira he inclined towards Shi-
vais, He built the town of Avantipura at Vishvouka-
sira the shrine where the souls of the dead receive sal-
vation, There, befoye he became king, he had set up the
image of the god Avantisvimi, and after becoming king
he sat up that of Avantishvara. And out of his silver
bathing vessel he made three seats for three gods, Tri-
pureshvara, Bhitesha, and Vijayesha.

Hig minister Shira was so devoted to him, that he
eared veither for his life nor for virtue nor oven for his
son in the service of the king. One day, witen the king
had offered his offerings, befitting his wealth, to god
Bhiteshvara, he saw that the wild Utpalashéka vegetable
had been placed by the priests on the seat of the god.
And when the king asked the reason, they fell prostrate,
and clasped their hands, and roplied :-—* In Lahara there
lives a fiery and strong man named Dhanva who is as
beloved of Shira as his own son. He always wombips
gods and has the power to bring down rain. Now this
person bas taken possession of the villoges attached

to-the temples and consequently this wild vegetable is

all which can be had, and which has been offered to the
god.” The king pretended yot to ‘hear the above, and
feigning to be suddenly attacked with colic pain, left
worship, and went out. But Shtira guessed that there
was some reason for the king’s leaving off the worship
-oud getting a sudden attack of colic pain, and began
to enquire into the matter. And when he learnt the
true reason he became angry. He entered tho domple
of Bhairava which was ucar the temple of Bhutesha,
and in which was Métrichakra, There he prevented the
people from crowding, aud encircled by a few followers, ho
repeatedly sont messengers to bring Dhanva. Dhanva,
ervol though brave, arrived with his infantry. But no
sooner had he entered the temple than the armed men
of the minister severed his head from his body, even
before the god Bhairava. The minister threw tho bleed-
ing body into a neighbouring tank, and went out to
assuage the anger of the king, The king heard that the
ininister had beheaded him whom he had loved as his son,
and wondered, and his anger abated. And whon Shira
enquired about the health of the king, he replied that his
pain was gone, The minister then raised him from his
be and caused him to finish his worship. Thus the mi-
nister who understood the motives of the king, was ready
to serve him and even to sacrifice his own life, although
not ordered todo so. The king and the minister were
never angry with each other, and never haye aking
ond a minister like therm been seen or heard of.

For ten years during this reign, animals did not kill
cxe another; in so much that Patina fish left the cold
water, and basked fearlessly under the aufumn sun on
the banks.

Ia this reign lived Shrikallata and other sages. And
though their history is long, yet I shall relate briefly the”
anezdote of one of them as it concerns the present his-
tory. Kgshmf{ra, intersected with many rivers and lakes,
was never a very productive country. It was owing to
tho vigourous efferts of Lalitéditya that the country was
drained in soma places and the produce of the Iand had
beon a little increased. But after the death of Jnyapida,
the kings who succeeded wera feeble, and the waters again
mereased to their formor bulk. And the consequence way
afunine, Paddy was sold at one thousand and fifty din-
néras per khéri.~ To save men and animals from this
calamity, Suyya, one of the sages, was born. No one
knew of hiy birth; and it was apparent from his
actions that, olthough born in the Kali Yuga, he
was not born of man. Suyyé, a chandéli by caste,
Was on one occasion sweeping the dust from the roads,
when she founda new earthen pot covered; and on

She thought that some unfortunate mother must” have

ing, suddenly, and out of afféotion for tho child, tho milk
came into her breast. Without polluting the child with
her touch she lodged it in the house of a wot nurse of
the Shudra caste, to whom she gave moncy onough for
its support. The child was named Suyya; and when
she grew up aud was educated, he became tho tutor of boys
in a rich man’s house. He was, for his good conduct
and intellect, considered as chief in the circle of the
learned. Ono day, when some people were grieving on
account of tho recent floods, he remarked that hoe had
intellect, but not money, aud he-rould, thoreforo give
no redross, This speech was reported to the king by
his spies, and the king wondered, and caused him to bo
brought before him. The King asked him as to what he
had said. He fearlessly repeated that he had intellect
but no money. The courtiers pronounced him to be
mad; but the king, in order to try his intellect, placed
all his wealth at the disposal of this man. Suyya took
out many vessels filled with dinnéras, and went by boat to
Madava. There in the village named Nandaka, which
was under water, he threw a pot of dinngras, and returned.
Although the courtiers pronounced him to be undonbt-
edly mad, tho king heard of his work, and enquired as to
what he did afterwards. At Yakshadora in Kramardjya ho
began to throw dinndras by handfuls into tho water.
The Vitasta was there obstructed by rocks which had fallen
into its bed from both its rocky banks ; and the villagers
who were suffering from scarcity, began to search for the

dinniras, and in so doing removed tho rocks which were in
,the bed of the river, aad cleared tho passage of the
‘water. No sooner had the water flowed out than Suyya
raised a stone embankment along the Vitasté, which was
completed within seven days. Ho then cleared the bed
of the river, and then broke down the embankments,
The passage was now quite open, and the river flowed
easily, and rapidly towards the sea, as if anxiously and
eagerly, afier this long detention; and consequently
tho land again appeared above the waters. Ho then cuf
new canals from dhe Vitasté wherever he thought that
the course of the river had been obstructed. Thus
many streams issued out of one main river, even like the
several heads of a scrpent from one trunk. Sindhu which
flowed from Trigrama to the left; and Vitasts on the
right were made to meet ono another at Vainyasvimi.
And even to this day the junction made by Suyyn near this
town exists; as also the two gods ViShnusvimf aud
Vainynavimi at Phalapura and Parihdsapura situated
on either side of the junction; and the god Hvishikesha
whom Suyya worshipped, just at the junction. And to
this day may also bescen the trees which grew on the
banks of the river as it flowed before, distinguished by
marks of ropes by which boals were tied to them.
Thus Suyya diverted the course of rivers, He mised o
atone embankment seven yojanas in length; and there-
by bfought the waters of the Mahdpadma lake under cou-

those of the Vitasté, and built many populous villages
after. having rescued the Jaifd from the waters. Thee
low lands which he protected by embankments are to
this time called Kundola, and there the harvest is very
plentiful. Even to this day when the rivers become
narrow in autumn, marks of the pillars which wera
erected by Suyya may be distinguished. When the
waters receded, the jars of diunéras which he had thrown
dn desp water st Nandakn, were found again. Tle oxa-
mined soveral places and iriegated mary villagos, the
produce of which did not dependa rnins, by means
of artificial canals cut from the Chanula and othor rivers
until the whole country become fruitful. Thus Suyya
benefited the country such as even Kashyapa or Valadeva
had not done. Before his time, paddy sold in Késhmira,
at two hundred dinnéyas a Khéri even after a bumper
crop, but since his time the samo quantity has sold at
only thirty-six dinngras. Wo built 1 beautiful city after
his own name on the Vitasté where it issued from the
Mahépadma lake, and he made a law that as long as the
world existed the fishes and birds of tho lake shonld not
be killed, He bestowed the village of Suyyakundala to
Dréhmanas, and erected a bridge “Suyydsetu after the
namo of her who had found him in the street. Avanti-
varmmg aud other kings built thousands and thousands
of villages on the land thus rescued from the waters,
King Avanti reigned well even like Maéndhgté. “He was

sbrine of Jyeshteshvara on tho hill of Tripnresha,
There on the approach of"death he manifested a leaning
towards Vaishnavism. He died listening to the Bha-
gavadgité, and meditating on Vishun’s heaven. His death
happened in the month of Ashfira, on the 3rd day of the
bright fortnight of the moon, in the year 59 of the era,

(On his death all the members of the family of Utpala
aspired to the throne, But Ratnavardhana the Royal
guard reised Shaukaravarmmdg, son of the late king, ,
to the throne.» The minister Karnapavinnépa beonme
envious, and, raisé&4, Sukhavarmmé the son of Sura-
varrmamg, to the dignity of heiy-apparent; and so the king
aud the heir-apparent became enemies to onch other,
and eonsequently the kingdom was frequently disturbed
by their quaxrels. Shivashakti and other warriors re-
fosed offers of wealth, honor, &c., from the opposite
party, and remained faithful to their master, and died
for him. Honorable men never desert their party. After
much trouble the king prevailed at last. He defeated
Samaravarmmé and others, on several occasions, and
acquired great fame.

Having thus beaten and subjugated his own relatives,
he made preparations for foreign conquests, Though
the country was weak in population, be was able to set
out with nine hundred thousond foot, three hundred ele-
phants, and one hundred thousand horse. He, whose
command had been ill obeyed in his own kingdom a
shért while before, new began to pass orders on kings.

His army was joined by the forces of tributary kings,
and increased as he went ‘on. On his approach thp
king of Déarvabhiséra fled in terror and there was
no fighting. The Kashmirinn army cought several
lions and confined them in a fort, a sort of abode
in which they had never lived before. The king
then marched for the conquest of Gurjjara, Prithivt.
chandra the king of Trigarta hid himself, but his son
Bhuvanachandra, on whom the king of Késhmfra had
bestowed woalth before, came to pay homage. But when
he saw the large army of Kishmipx, he became afraid of
being captured, and accordingly turned and fled. The
king of Kashmira, whom tho historians deseribe as a, very
handsome man, was regarded by other kings as Death!
Shankaravarmmé easily defeated Alakhéna king of
Gurjjnra who ceded Takka a part of his kingdom to his
conqueror. The king of the Thakkiyaka fumily took
service as guard under the king of Kashmira, The
Tatter caused the kingdom of the Thakkiya king
which had been usurped by the king of Bhoja to be res-
tored to him. The king of the country which lay between
Darat and Torushka, (a3 the Aryavarta lies between Himg-
Jaya and Vindbya,) Lailiya Shahi by name, who was
among kings even as the sun is among stars, and was also
Jord ‘over Alnkhénn, did not submit to the king of Késh-
amfra, on which the latter drove him out of his country.
After his conquest, Shankoravarmmé returned ‘to his
country, and built a town named after him in the pro-

vince of Panchasattra. In that beantiful town ho also sot
up two imagos of Shiva, Shankaragaurisha and Sugan-
dhesha—the formor named aftor himself, nnd the latter
. after his queen Sugandhé, daughter of Shrisvamf{, king of
Udakpaths, One Néyaka, a learned man, built another
temple to Sarasvati in the neighbourhood of the above>
mentioned temples. Pocots purloin from each other's
poetry, and the great rob other men of their properties
and thereby increase the beauties of their own works.
In order to adorn, this new-built town, tho king conveyed
into it beautiful things from Parihdsapura. The salo
of beasis for which the town of the Pattavas was
celebrated, now went onin this new-built city. Ratna-
varithana the minister, who had raised the presont king
to tho throno, set up a Shiva named Shriratnavardhana,

Té is strange that the king who had once done glorious
acts, now began to do things which were ovil. Hebecame
avaricious, and began to oppress his subjects. His treasury
wasempty, and in order to meet the hoavy expenses of
his luxury, he at last, and alter consultation with his
advisers, commenced to plunder the temples, He raised
money from towns, houses, and villages, and created two
offices named Attapatjbhaga and Grihakritya.* He auu-
ningly appropriated the money which was set apart for the
purchase of incense and oil for the use of the temples« And

#The duty of these officers appears to have been to help hitn

on pretence of suporintending temples he plundered sixty-
four of them through theit headmen. Te took lease
of villages attached to the temples, but appropriated
all the income without paying anything to the gods,
The king gave only one-fourth of what had _hitherts

“been given annually to the courtiers for the cost of their
food, blanket &c. ; and this was more than what he wished
to give. When he found village officers absent from their
posts, he fined them one year’s pay through the respect-
ablo persons of the villages. Ife algo fined innocent
rural officers thair year’s pay. Thug-ho infroduced heavy
and impoverishing imposts in villages; these imposty
wore of thirteen auris. He impoverished villages by col-
lecting the monthly salaries of his Kiyasthas who waro
given to cruel extractions, and by various other means.
From the savings made by reducing gifts to temples
asalso from the fine imposed on villages, ha managed
his household expenditure. Ho established five camps
anda sixth named Lavata the principal treasury, on
spots where the various industries of the country were
carried on.

When the subjects were thus severely oppressed, the
king's son Gopalavarmmé took compassion on the pedple
and one day thus spoke to his father :-—*O father | the boon
which you promised to grant me hefore,and you are a truth-
ful man, Task of you now. The steps which you have
adopted through the advice of Kéyasthas, hardly teave any
hope or means to your subjects to live upon. It is “not

likely that any good will come to you in this or in tho next
world from your tyranby. Who can say what effoct these
oppressive acts may bring in the future world? But
in the present world there is nothing but mischief.
People suffer from the avarice of kings more than from
famine, disease, &c, When the king is avaricious, no one
wishes for his welfare. Charity and kind words can
conquer the world, but avarice destroys charity and
kindness. Tho avarice of kings destroys their beauty,
length of reign and power, Tho inheritors of an ceono-
mical man thrive; but no servant will do good to him
whois not grateful. “Even his own men try to kill him
who has gathered immense wealth, What unpleasant
things may not be effected by avarice,—as by enemics ?
Avarice is the cause of disgrace to kings, so desist from
auch avarice.” Having heard the gentle words of the
prince the king amiled and calmly replied “ your advica
against tyranny has roused in me the fesling I felt
uf yore. When I was young like you, I waa a prince,
aud, Tike you, loved the subjects. According to my
father’s direction, I used to wear iron mail in summer,
in winter I could not wear warm clothes, and wos made
to qo abont with my feet bare. Hunters who used to go
hefore me, saw me walking by my horse, my feet torn
with thorns, and eyes filled with tears, and spoke Ml of
my father. But my father said that he had rigen to the
dignity* of a king from a low position, and that ha knew
huw,to appreciate the labors of those who served in dif-

forent cnpacities; and that after undergoing such pain
myself I should be able to know the sufferings of others,
which otherwise I should never be able to appreciate,
being born rich. 1, who have thua been schooled by my
,iathor in hardships, am now oppressing my people after
getting the kingdom. As the sentient being, when born,
forgets the pain which it felt when in the womb, even
go the king, after getting a kingdom, forgets tho thoughts
, he used to entertain before. Therefore, grant me a
boon that after getting the kingdont you will not be
more oppressive than I om.” Welen the king hod snid
thus, the courtiers who were there, smiled and looked on
the prince, who held down his face in shame.

The king was unwilling to make presents and there-
fore kept himself aloof from the company of learned men,
while Bhallata and other minor poets attended his court.
Good poets did not get any pay from him, but Bhari-
kolavata used to get two thousand dinndxas as his salary,
The fact of the king’s birth in a family of Kalpnpéla
was betrayed by his vulgar words which were like those
of a drunkard. His venerable looking minister Sukha-
raja behaved like an actor on the stage, in order to do
things according to the wishes df the bad king, ‘The
king fearing a rebellion, killed during night the in-
nocent and heroic chief of Dérvidbhisira, Naravdéhane
and his servants. Twenty or thirty of this wicked king’s
sons died without any disease, through the curse of his
subjects. Kings who oppress their subjects lose their

wives and children, wonlth and life in a moment; and I
shall narrate hereafter how even his name has been lost by
bis crucl deeds.

He built a town named Pattana, and made his minis-
ter Sukhargja’s nephew (sister’s son) lord of Dvéra, but
that man lost his life at Birdnaka through his own care-:
lJessness. This incensed the king, and he marched
upon, and devastated Biréuska, and entered Uttara-
path, He conquered many kingdoms on tho banks of
tho Indus, and when the affrighted people of these places
submitted, he returned. When he was entering Urasha
with the inhabitants Of the place, and his army lay en-
camped, an arrow of a hunter came from the top of a
hill and accidentally pierced his throat. When on the
point of death, ho ordered his faithful men to lead back
the army to his country. He was carried on a karnira-
tha. His sight became dim, but bo knew his weaping
queen Sugandhg by her voice, entrusted to her care his
boy Gopélavarmmd, and expired as the arrow was ex-
tracted from the wound. His death happened on the way,
ou the 7th day of the dark fortnight of the moon in the
month of Phdélguna, in the year 77 of the Kashmfrian
era .

Sukhorgja and others safely conducted tha army
through the hostile countries, concealing the fact of the
king’s death. By some contrivance made by means of
a cords {he king’s dead body was made to bend to the
feugatory princes who bowed to him. After six days ihe

army reached Vallisaka, a place within the Kgshmirinn
territory, whero being free fram fear, they performed the
funeral rites of their dead king. Sureudravati and two
other queens perished on the funaral pyre, as also the
grateful Vélavitu and able Jayasinha, and two servants
“Lada and Vajraséra. Thus perished seven persons in the
flame.

Then the virtuous and truthful Gopdlavarmmd, began
to reign under the direction of his mother Sugandhé,
Though he was yet a boy, and lived. among the vilo
and the seduced, yet he did yt contract any bad
habit. His mother was now a widow, and living in
luxury, asked Prabhékaradeva, a minister (treasurer),
to her embrace, aud bestowed on ber paramour wealth,
rank, and three good districts. The treasurer robbed
the queen of much wealth and built a town Bhéndapura
at Shéhirgjyo. The reigning Shéhi* disobeyed his orders
to build the ‘town, on which he changed the name of
the country to Kamalaka, and gave it to’ Tomaréua
the son of Lalliya. Returning thence he entered the

‘ gapital, proud of his victory and of his intrigue with
the queen. In the pride of his victory, he constantly in-
sulted warriors with harsh words. » No one was allowed to
enter the palace as long ashe was there as it it werea
houge of if fame. The young king came to know of thi

affair at last; and once accilentally met the minister

who was robbing him of his*wealth and honor, The king

then examined the treasury, aud there being a deficit,

the treasurer explained that the amount wanting had

been spent in the war with the Shahi, The treasurer was
afraid of the king, and caused magic to ba performed”
by his friond Ramudeva, through the influence of which

the king was burnt to death, He reigned for two years.

The evil work of Ramadeva being known, be became

afraid of punishment and committed suicide.

Sangkata, the brother of the last king, and like him,
picked up in the atveets, then became king; but he died
in ten days,

The dynasty of Shangkaravarmmés being now oxtinct,
the queon Sugandha at the request of the subjects began
to reigu herself. She built a town named Gopalapura, a
temple Gopdlamatha, and a god Gopélakeshava ; and au-
other town named after her. Nandg, the widow of the
late king Gopalavarmmé, and born of high family, de-
voted herself though young to the services of god-
Keshava. She was then in the family way, and her
raother-in-law hoped forason. But the death of the
chiwhich happened efter delivery grieved the reigning
queen, and she was auzious to make over the kingdom
fo some one of the family, The foot soldiers formed
themselves into companies here and there, Sngandha
reigned” for two years with the help of her Ekdngyas.

124 KINGS OF KASTIMERA,

Tho Tantris* were hey ministere, Ju order to make over
the kingdom to somo worthy"person, she invited to couy-
cil the Tantris and the Ekdngens from among her minis-
ters and the captains, As the line of Avantivarmmda was
extinct, she selected Nirjjitavarmma, sou of Sukhavarmmé
“by Garggé, and grandson of Shuravarmmé, in the hopo
that being her relative, he would act according to ,her
directions, But she was opposed by some of her minis-
ters as her nominee was unfit for the kingdom on account
of his bad habits, Tor he nsed to squander money in
nightly dissipation and to sleep during the day, and was
moreover extremely idle. Inthe meantimo the Tantri
infuntry separated themselves from her party, and mado
Partha, son of Nirjjitavarmm4g, a boy of ten years, king,
and expelled the queen out of the country. The minis-
ters who were insulted by the treasurer Probhikaradeva,
the queen’s paramour, thought themselves avenged by
the expulsion of the queen. She was driven out of her
territory aud spoiled of her possessions, Jeft the capital
weeping. Those of her servants on whom she relied,
now joined the enemy. However in the year 89 of the
Rishinician ere, the Ekinggs soldiers combined together
and brought back Sugandha whe was then dwellity at
Hushkapura. Hearing of her approach the Tantrfs who

were in favor of Partha, went out at the and of Chaitra
to fight with the ex-queen’s men. On the 90th year tho
ax-queen’s amy was signally defeated, and she was
captured when in the act of fleeing. Sho was afterwards
murdered in a deserted Buddhist Vihéra. Strange is
the unsteady rise and fall of fortune !

Anarchy now prevailed, and life and property became
inseoure. The king being a boy, his father “the idle”
was his guardian ; he took bribe, and joined the ministers
and oppressed the people. Feudatory kings began to
out-bid one another in giving bribes, and serving the
Tantris, aud to carry oh sanguinary fouds among them-
selves, The kings of Késhmfra had formerly conquered
Konouje and other countries, but now hor kings bribed
the Tantris that they might be allowed to live, The sons
of the minister Meru who set up an image of Vishnu
named Shr{mertivardhans, now engaged themselves in a
deep plot to usurp the kingdom, They got Wealth by op-
pressing the people. The eldest of them Shangkaravar-
dhana entered into friendship with Sugandhaditya and
seoretly robbed the palace.

Now it so happened that when the people were nume-
tically reduced, the Aujumn harvest of Shdli corn was
destroyed; so that one khaii of yrain sold for one thour
sand dinndras, Consequently in the year 93, there was
great senrcity, and many died of the faaine. Hardly
could tha waters of Vitasté be seen, so thick did the
swollen corpses of men float ov its waters. The boues

of the deceased lay thick on every side like ono vast field
of the deal, At this time, the miniStors and the Tantris
became rich by selling rico at high prices. That minister
was the kiny’s favourite, who at this time sold the people
and bribed the Tantriy, The king’s father “ the idle”
felt himself at easo though be saw men in trouble, even
like a person sitting within a warm chamber, and seeing
persons outsile battered by the storm in a wood, Many
subjects were murdered by the king. Happily tho kings
of this time reigned for short periods ouly; even as
bubbles in the ruin-water. Somotimes Pértha reigned
setting asidu his futher by the belt of the’ Tantris; and
sninotimes his father sot him aside by the same means.
Tho wives of “the idle? took Sugandhéditya as their
paramour. Vappata, one of the queens of “the idle,”
gave her lover Sugamlhéditya much wealth. The sons of
Meruvardhana, had, in the hope of acquiring influence in
the king 114 1anrried their beautiful sister Muiydvatf to
the itie.” Ant she too accepted Sugandhaditya ag her
lover. This min used to visit his paramours by turns;
and as each wished to get her son coronated, each gave
him wealth, aud yielded her person to him.

Tu the year 97, in the month of Pousha, the Taptris
set nila Partha and set up his father “the idle,” their
protect to the throne, But in the mouth of Migha next
yew he ‘hcl after having coronated his infunt son Chak-
ruvarmiad. The Tantei iufantry, then in favor of Partha,
fuught with tho Ekduggus of the opposite side for the

KINGS OF KASmMfRa, 127

kingdom, Queen Vappata, mother of tho infant king, was
his guardian for a showt time, but then her mother took
care of the child for ten years. During the infancy of
the king his bad character was not apparent.

Tn the year 9 (of the next century) the ministers set
aside Chakravarmmaé, and raised to tho throne Shura-.
varmmg son of “the idle,” by queen Mriggvati. His
maternal uncles, sons of Meruvardhana, had no affection
for him. They withheld what was due to the Tan-
tris, and hence*became the canse of his deposition.
Though the king was a good man, yet ho was no
favourite of tite Tantris, for they received no money from
him. After a year he was deposed, and the Tontrt
infuniry got much wealth from Partha and again made
him king. A public woman named Sdmbavat{, who had
set up a goddess named Sdmbeshvarf, and who kvew the
art of arranging the Tantri army, became the favourite
of Partha, Chakravarmmé waited his time, offered large
wealth tothe Tantris, and in the year 11 in the month
of Ashéva was made king again. The foolish Chakra-
varmmé reposed much power on the sons of Meruvar-
dhana who were known to be bad. They and the cons-
pirgtors enjoyed the kingdom, setting aside Pirtha and
other kings: they took much land from the kings, they
dethroned the king’s father aud brother, and oven in-
jured their relatives with whom they were related by
minal marriages, The king made Shangkarabardhana,
the eldest uf them, Chief Justice, and made Shambhu-

bardhana, another of them, the head of the office of
Urihakvitya. In the month of Pougha of the game year,
he failed to pay the Taniris their due for want of money,
and fled in fear.

Tho king having fed to Madava, Shangkarabardhana
avith the intention of becoming king, sent his brother Sham-
bhubardhana to the Taniris as messenger. But the latter
having promised large wealth to the Tantriy, came to'an
agreement with them, and cansed himself to be mada
" king, thus out-witting his clder brother. The large fish
outs the smuller fry, the heron cats the largo fish, and
the fowler kills the heron. .

Chakravarmina, spoiled of his glory, entered one night
into the house of a headinan of the Daimara tribe,
named Sangrama, living at Shifdhakka. Te knew his
gest to be the king, and made his homage to him, and
gave him his own seat. The king, now humbled, and
driven from 4iis kingdom, asked him for aid. “ Who
counts the Tantris or yrass in battle” said Sangréma
“and what ara we not capable of doing in your service ?
But if we help you now, you will kill us afterwards,
for kings do not remember the services done to them
after the work i, done. As the woodman, when he des-
eends from a tive, cuts down the branches which helped

forgets the past services of those who aided him in his
danger, and remembers tlreir fanlis if they chance to
commit any. Kings when powerful, kill thiongh shame
thoso very followers who had seen them in disense, hun-
get, pain, and in fear of enemies &e. Though the king
bea good one, yet nothing can be expected from him>
for evil councillors speak evil of others. The king's
mind may be averted from evil during the day time,
but none can avert his mind from tho teachings of his
queen, his instruglor by night. What is infused with dif
fioulty during the day, the king like a white ass forgets
during the night. “Every one who approaches the
king, becomes the object of his avarice, and afterwards
lus victin. The king destroys those near him, not those
who are afar. No one can know beforehand the evil
propensity of kings who wait their time. The lion
stoops when he kills, the seipent embraces when it bites,
and the devil smiles when he destroys. “Even so the
king praixes when he murders. If you do not oppress us
afterwards, I shall march with my army along with you
even tomorrow morning.” The king felt abashed, and
replied : “ You who are doing me this service will be
kept as safe from harm as my soul.” Then they both
put their legs on the bloody skin of a sheep, and with
awords in their hands embraced each other. On the
morning Chakravarmmé followed by innumerable Déma-
ras, marched towards the capital. The Tantrf in-
fuptry placed Shangkerabardhana at their head, and

went out on the 8th bright lunar day of Choitra to mect
the enemy. Chukravarmiué made rapid marches unosten-
tatiously and in dissuise. A sharp fight ensued outside
the town of Padmapura in which Shanglarabardhana
wus killed by Chakravarmia who rode a horse, On his
‘leath, the Tuutii army fled in every direction. But
Chakraverminé overtook them in their flight and beheaded
them with his sword, In this battle the ‘Tantris
lost five oe nix thousand men, who were killed by Chak-
yavarming, nad remained nuder the shadow of vultures’
wings. Who did not admire the Tantifs who rose and
fell together! ‘Chere too perished Shangkarabardhana
with his vrevtness and his followers. Theso Tautris who
porishel there had once ruled the proud aud unap-
proachable kings of a great family at their will, ag tho
snake-players do the snakes. They of whom kings hal
begged fur their very life were thus humbled; and these
eruel evileloea who had once insulted Chakravarmoms,
and put lim to uticf, were now destroyed by‘his deep-
felt enmity.

On the seconl day Shambhubardhana eolleeted the
broken army of the Tantris ; but in the meantime Cha-
kravaranod enteral the capital followed by his cuptaius ;
the ministers aud tha Ekdnuyas and soldiers covering
the rls frm all sides and coming from several direc-
tiuns with Pond din. Chakravarimé rode amidst his caval-
ty, holding the reins of lia horse aud his turban Iv~his

sun's taya on his ear-pendent. His iron mail pressing
gn his throat made his face red and terrible. He checked
the greedy soldiers who wore plundering the shops, and pa-
cified the frightened inhabitants of the place, The sound
of the kettle drum, and ihe ery of blessings of the people
deafened the ear. When the king, flushed with success,”
was, seated on his throne, Bhubhata brought Shambhubar-

Now Chakravarmmé having got the kingdom and dos-
troyed all his enemies, became vain and cruel, He loved
flattery and those who flattered him. Soothed by flattery,
and considering himself a god, he did many foolish acts.
At this time a foreigner named Rangga whd was a good

sides ay if fur the second time they scattered fluwers in
tha court. The court rang with the song of the singers
singing the praise of the king and “ Long live the king,”
‘Victory to the king,” &. The two girls tuned the
‘flute to the tune of Pangchama, and sang without moving
the head ov the eye; and it appeared as if only one
person was singing. The king gazed on them without
moving aud steadfastly, The girls marked the king’s
emotion, aud sang more charmingly. They aud the king
interchinged their thoughts by their glances. One of
the courtiers marked the king's feelings ‘and thus en-
couraged lu. passion, “As the Maireya wine, O king, is
perfuuek by camphor, so is the song, by tho lips of
these two girls, The moon kisses their white teeth as
they sing; they by their motions, songs and glances

are speaking of them, is smiling aud looling at us ; the

could not beguilo fools, who would have wandered in
hell. Tho king who was ag liberal as Radheya (Karna)
but on unworthy objects, pleased ihe Domvas with the
_ presents of Hara, Keyura and Kundala (ornaments) and

went to the iuner apartments. Fie to them who spend
their wealth on simple songs mistaking them for poetry."
The beauty of havlots, of tho rainbow, and of the or-
dinary song abideth not long. The king could not rost
antisfied without those two girls. They too, while they
were singing, , embraced the king, at which he felt
ashamed. The perspiri ation caused by his passion mado
the king’s body cool, and it scemed as if the warmth of
his good fortune left him.

Hansi was made his principal queen. Those who ate
the remnants after her meal became good courtiers.
The ministers who served the Domva were promoted to
the posts of judges in the courts of justice &c. Somo of
the Domvas, on account of their ignorande were not
created miuisters ; others who knew of politics managed
the kingdom. The newly created ministers were thieves.
The queen and the fuvourites were of low caste (titer-
ally ;—-those who cooked dog's flesh) Every thing was
wugsial in the kingdym. Tho queen after the monses
gave gifts of her clothes stained with her blood, and.
the ministers ontered the court covered with these
cluthes and felt themselves proud. Some determined to
vpposi the king, and did not take the food tasted by

no powerful yods existed in vhe country, for then loy
caste people could not have entered the temples. On the
Tiladvédash{ day the principal queen visited Ranasvami
followed by tha proud people of her caste. The orders
“of these people, because of their connection with the
king, were obeyed as king’s. The king bestowed tho
village of Helu to Rangga, but the Patta (clerk) did not
write out the gift, Rangga entered the court of justice,
and angtily asked the clerk, calling him the son of 5
formale servant, why ho dil not write out the gift. Terti-
fiel at the anger of Rangga, the clork wrote out the
gift at last, What law is not upset when the king is bad?
The king asked what expialion would palliato his
connection with the low caste women, and his gay com-
pavions made him perfurn some ludicrous acts. His
courtiers advised Lim that cold is destroyed by cold,
and crimes by crimes. In order to palliate his connec-
tion with low caste women, he corrupted the wife of a
Bréghmaua who had been fasting for n month for some-sre-
ligious purpose. Some Bighmanas were still more vicious
than the king; they ate in the king’s house, and received
gifts of villages from him. ©

He contracteL fiiendship with minister Bhubhata, snd

ficLting on foot, Riukka saw tho goddess Shri in the tank

chief; end he raised an iinago of the same shapo as he
had een, and named it Rakkoajiyd.

Guided by the advice of Parvyagupta who wished to
clear the country of all enemies, and then to usurp it,
the king began to destroy his kindred, He plundered
his futher Partha who was supported with his family by
the gifts of the beggars of Jayendravihdra where ho
resided. The" king closed up the dvors of the room
where Sbangkaravarmmd and his infant brothers were,
and thus sturved them to death. Ho then intended to
murder his father ; and guve gifts of clothes &c. to some of
hia winisters who favored his view, the rest he confined
with ebuins. One night according-to the kinyg’s ordets,
Pirths was surrounded by ministers, captains, Tantris and
Raiyesties, They shut the door and murdered his wife,
and ainy auurdered her infants weeping and embracing
their author. ‘The minister Kumuda and other: £00

helpless, unarmed and naked, lean for want of food, and
erying. The king hoard the news of his father’s death,
and on the morning went to the spot out of curiosity
accompanied by his ministers, and was glad to see the
cecurrence of tho previous night. The courtiers prided
themselves and pointed out the wounds which each of
them had inflicted. With the king’s permission, Parvya-
gupte told his son Devagupta to paint the king with his
father’s blood whereupon the young man sent a knife into
the dead man’s limbs and the blood spouted out and smeared
the person of the king.» This mado the king laugh long.

After the murder of Chakravarmmé the Damaras
plundered the country. The king again raised the
wicked Kégyosthas, who oppressed the country, to high
posts. Advised by evil ministers, he learnt the use of
arms by striking off the breasts of prostitutes. He ripped
open the wombs of pregnant women to se the fotus,
and he hacked the limbs of blacksmiths, in order to try
their strength. Bréhmanas accepted from him gifts of
villages, either through avarice or through fear of life.

The king was attacked with consumption, a disease
befitting his cruelty ; and he suffered great pain as long
as he lived, Not only wore his subjects glad of his
death, but so also were his fourteen queens. The king
died during summer of the year 15.

that the line of Utpala was oxtinct, they began to dis-
cuss as to whom they would select. But on account of
difference of opinion they could not bathe ( coronnte) any
one, except their mutual beards with spitting (the effect
of hot discussion.) Kamalabardhana appeared before
them in order to remind the Brahmanas of his claims but
thoy pelted at him. During the five or six days that
thoy passed in discussion, there camo many courtiers to
the Br dhmanas with many followers and loud music and
with banuers and umbrellas in their carriages. Kamala-
bardhaua now repented.

The widow of the late king who had murdered his father,
sent officers to the Bréhmanas to urge tho elaims of her
infant son (who had lately been dethroned by Kamaln-
bardhana,) whom she had been concealing. Viradeva had
aaou named Kimadeva in the village Pishichakapura.
This Kamadeva bore a good character, aud used to teach
boys in the house of Merdvardhana. In time he beoame
the treasurer, and his son Prabh&ékara soon became the
treasurer of king Shangkaravarmmé. Prabhakara who
wax the paramour of queen Sugandhd died in the sub-
sequent revolution. His son Ynshaskara became very
poor, and went out of the country with his friend-Phal-
vunaka; but dreaming a good dream he returned to
his usuatry hopeful. The messengers who were sent
by the widow of the parricide, selected him, and sent

him, because of his eloquence, to the Drélimanas, But
no sooner had the Brahmanas‘scen ‘him, thau they all,
of a sudden cried out londly— let this be king,” and
they soon bathed him king. Providence ordains, that

Ton first act of this new king Yashaskara was to order
his door-keepers to send away the Brghmanas who had
selected him king, as he did not like to be disobeyed by
any one. To the Brahmanas themselves, who were
frightoned by the door-keepers, the king said, clasping
tovether his hands, “you bave bestowed the kingdom on
mo and you should, be respected as gods; remain proud
of your action in having bestowed a kingdom, but come
not tome unless on business.” This act of the king
male the Bréhmanas think him to be unapprouchable ;
nad they forgot tho familiarity which existed whon he
dwelt with them.

King Yashaskara enforced the old laws and practices
long out of use in the kingdom ; and the country be-
came devoid of thicves, so that the doors of the houses
of merchants were kept open during the night, and tra-
vellers were undisturbed in the streets, Under the king’s
supervision the servants of the State who used to steal so
largely, lost their posts and had merely to superintend
agriculture, The agricultural people hud never occasion
during this reign to come to court; nor Bréhmanns read-
ing the Vedas, to take up arms. Bréhmanns who chaited
the Sama Veda did not drink wine, nor did they, whe per-
formed iapa have wife or child, or keep animals or corn.

judgo and the writer were all"learned men in this reign.,
One day o Bréhmana who wsed to porform the rites of
Priéyopaveshana came to the king and said that he was ,
an inhabitant of Késhmifra, that ho had been rich before,
“Dnt through misfortrme had been reducod to poverty,
His debts had incroascd and he was harrasged by his
creditors, so that he had sald his horse to a rich mor-
chant and paid up his debts by selling overy thing
and had gone ont to travel in different countries. But
considering, said ho “ that my wife should be supported,
T retained possession of a woll with a stairease (part. of
the house) that she may live by letting the place on hive
to these who in sunimer may like to keep betela and
flowers there. After wandering for twenty yenvrs in diffor-
ent places, and having acquired some little wealth I have
again returned to my country. I found my wife de
prived of her beanty, and getting her livelihood by serv-
ing a3 a female servant to some one. Taskod Her why she
hal undertaken service, sines T had left her the means of

chaut had driven her out of the well and staircase by

shall die at your door ; and if you fear sin, judge right-
ly. The king then sat ou his soat of justice, and called
in all the judves and began to investigate the mattor.
The judgos snid that they hod several times adjudged
the Bighmana’s case, but that he had lost his suit, that
he ought to be punished, and that he did not admit the»
justice of the decision because of his cunningness. The
king saw the sale-deod, and found thatthe well with
the staircaso had been sold along with the house. But
the king thought that the plaintiff was in the right.
After thivking for a momont, he began to amuse the
courtiors with his conversation; and in the midst of
the talk, he from time to time took jowels from several
persons as if to examine them; and in the same way
he took a ring from the defondaut to look at it, Asking
them all to wait for a moment, he ou pretence of wash-
ing his feet, withdrew from the room, and sent one
of his servants with the ring and proper instructions to
the house’ of that very merchant. The king's servant
weat to the account-keeper of the trader and asked him
for the accounts from the year in which the sale of the
house was effected. The account-keeper thought that
the merchant might have some necessity for the accounts,
gave them over to him, taking from him the ring. Among
the items of expenditnre, the king saw that a sur of 4
thousand dinngras had been paid to the court writer, and
knowing that the fee of writing document was small,
wandered as to why the merchant should have paid so

euunts to the courtiers, aul caused the court writer to
be brought; and haying assured him of his safety, he
proved the fraud to the court. The courtiers admired
»the king, and the king gave to the plaintiff, the house
aud wealth of the merchant whom he exiled out of hiy
country.

Once upon a tine when he had said his evening prayer,
and ways goiig to tuke his meal, a door-keeper, afrnid to re-
port thus untimely said that a Brghmana had now brought
a complaint ; that he bad told the Bidhmana that the
court time wan over, aud ho should lay his complaint
the next day, bub that the Bréhmana throntened to
kill himself unless he was granted on audience that day.
‘Without taking his meal, the king ordered him to be
brought in. The poor Bréhmans when questioned, said
that after travelling in varions ovuntries, aud nequirtag
one hundred gold Rup ikas he had returned to Kashmfra

The case vow depended on the verbal contract made and
the people blamed me fdr making the contract ; the laws
being strict on the point. Your laws are bad and go [

make and the name of the man, but he replied thut he
could only describo his face. The king then said that
he would do what the Brétmana desired, the next morn-
ing, ond dined with him that evening. Wien the mer-

" chants of Lavanotso sent for by the king arrived, one of
them was pointed out by the complainant as the offending
person, When questioned, that man corroborated what
the Brihmanua had said before, but pointed to the exigt-
ing Saw and the agreement made. The Brdhmana bad
engaged himself by his promise, and the people waited
to see the result of the case. The king then sat on. the
seat of justice and ordered uinety-eight pieces to be given

pluined that instead of saying, “ give what you will,” the

Brihmana said “whatever you wish, you may give.” Now
this avaricious person wished ‘for ninety-eight pieces byt
gave the Brahmana only two pieces, which he did noé
wish for. Thus the king adjudged cases.

Though in this manner he taught justice to others, ha
became au object of ridicule on account of his conduet,
like a physician who prescribes good diet to others, but
himself takes bad food, Though the king was pure, yet
he did uot desert those who during the last reign had
taken of food polluted by Domba. He exacted money
through four policemen who again helped one another.
This truthful king killed somo fodt soldiers though they
laid down their arms before the shrine of Shriraneshvarn.
He wasso glad on the death of his older brother that
mauy wise men who were near him thought that he had
caused his brother's death by magic. He made a courte-
aan Lallg, supreme over all his chaste wives and sdb-
jected himself to her control. Goodness finds no en-
trance into the heart of women. Tt seems asif for that
rensou Vidhété has made their breasts finely round out
side. Knowing that they feel equal affection towards
tha gaod and the bad, Vidhits has made them externally
beautiful. This Lallé thengh favored by the king, csed
tn receive even one chandila constable to her embrace.
Yet there inust have been some quality in that constable
that she being a queen should condescend so far in his
favor. Possibly she might have been born a chandéla, or
possibly he was a lucky man. No one knew how they

first fell in love. One officer named Hadi only knew of
* their love, having scen’ them-looking on cach other with
a peculiar glance. The king at last found out through his
spies that the rumour of their love was founded on truth
“and in penitence, he wore skin of a deer (Krishnasdra)
aud did penance. Those near him entertained suspi-
cions, because through the excess of his affection he
did ot Iill her in anger. The king became contaminated
with sin by being near to those servants who had
eaten (in the previous reign) out of the Domba’s plates.

The king thought that it was owing to some virtue
committed in “his previous birth that he had obtained
the kingdom in the prosent, although not burn in the
royal family. Ambitious of obtaining kingdoms in his
future lives, he bestowed his wealth on Bréhmanas,
He raised a school in the place of his ancestral worship,
for the education of the children of Aryya countries,
aud he gave chémara, umbrella and treasnres to the
Principal of that achool. On the banks of the Vitasté
he bestowed fifty-five villages to the Bréhmauas.

At loat the king was attacked with » bowel complaint.
He discarded hig son Sanggrdmadeva as not being born
of him, and crowned | Vorvata. sou of Rémadeva, and
graudson of his uncle, and placed him under the care

fonnd one Bréhmana named Chakrabhinu at Chakvame-
lanka, engaged in seme vile act. The king was ronsed

_ with virtuous indignation, and oaused the Briéhmana’s
forehead to be marked with the foot of adog. This
Bréhmana’s maternal uncle Virandtha was the king’s
minister for war and pence ; and he somebow killed the
king. This version cannot be trusted, as it appears to
have been got up by the Bréhmanas in order to prove the
atrength of their power by examples from past history, For
they say that the king diel seven days after the
marking of the Brihmahas forehead, while as a fact ho
suffered a long time from disease. Or, if you maintain
that he died of some other disease, then it may be as well
believed that he died through the curse of Varnata and
others.

After reigning for nine yenrs, the king died in the
twenty-fourth year of the Kishmirian era ir the month
of Bhidra, on the third dark lunar day.

present sovereizn. Parvyvagupta dyed his black beard
with saffrou as kings used to do. He feared to destroy
the prince publicly, on account of the Ekanggas, and
therefore employed magic. One night he heard a Divine
voice saying ‘On the first day of Chaitra, the kingdom
will come to you luvfully, but if you attempt otherwise,
your life and your line will soon be dt an ond.” Ife
was afraid his magic would be fruitless. Ue feared
the Mkéuguas, and lived in gruat bewilderment sud
excitement day and night, aud his senses were well
nigh lost, One day when the paths were nafrequonted
by men on account of a heavy fall of snow, he collected an
army and besieged thecapitul. He killed the loyal mi-
nister Ramavardhana who was obstructing his son Buddha,
The ancestral Delavitta then pulled Parvvagupta
by garlands of flowers from the throne, aml threw
him on the ground. Vakrangydhrisangréma*® was
then mordered by Parvvagupta in another house, and his
body, with 9 stone tied rouud the neck, was thrown du-
ring night into the Vitasté. . -

the month of filguna, on the tenth dark lunar day Pary-
yagupta seated himself on the throne. He was the sun

of Sangrémagupta, son of Abbinava, the Divira, who in-
babited the other side of the, hill of Vishoka. Those who

were determined not to see him king, came in the morn-
ing and bowed to him. While the minor chiefs, the Ek-

anggas, the ministers, the Kayasthas, and the Tantris were

afraid of him, and gave up all idea of further resistance.

A big drum which was in the care of Madandditya, the
Eksugega of the descendants of Suyya, was broken

through carelessness, On this the king became angry

aud insulted Wim by disrobing him. Madandaditya

shaved his hair® and beard, aud became a hormit.

Even to this day his descondants are dwelling at Tri-

pureshvara, ‘The king was avaricious and encouraged

the servants who harassed the people, Aud with this ill-

gotten wealth he set up a god named Parvvagupteshvara

near the temple of Skanda.

There was a noble minded and wise lady among the
females of the kiug Yashaskara. This chagte Indy evaded
the embraces of Parvvagupta on various pretexts. “ If
you complete” said she to Parvvagupta “the temple of
Yashaskarasvéwi, only half dene by my late husband,
T shall comply with your request.” Puffed up with
pride, the king completed the temple within a few days,
But the queen perished in the fire lighted for the conse-
eration of the fave; and when she died, fowers wera
showered on her from the heaven aud whoever looked
ou Her, with lustful eyes was streck dumb, The king pined
in disappointment, and was attacked with a disease, in

which he continually felt thirsty. Avaricious men, al- ,

though they kuow that they are heré but for a short time,
do not leave their habits. The king on account of some
virtues committed in fortner life died at the shrine of Sure-
shvari, thus relinquishing on the thirteenth day of the
dark bolf of Ashdda, in the year twenty-six, the kingdom
which he had obtained by rebellion. Ef some portion of
the future punishment were not visible in this eafth,
who wonld desist from sin ?
His son Kshemagupta sueceeded him.” This king was
a great drunkard and naturally wicked, and was ren-
dered still moro so, by his evil asscviates, eVen as clouds
shed a deeper darkuess over a moonless night. Phalguna
and other wicked courtiers who served him, dressed them-
selves ag richly as the king. Though the king was ad-
dicted to wine, women and dice, and his courtiers stole
enormously, yet his wealth was uot exhausted ; and it is
strange that the king still remained so rich. Is it not
strange that Shri ( wealth) should even for a day love the
lotus, whose friend is the affectionate black-bee who loves
honey and sucks it from the bud? Vimana and other
courtiers of the family of Jishnu tempted him like the
devil. The king beeame a scoffer of others, addicted +o
other people's wives, and covetous of other people's
wealth, He plucked the beards of those who waited
on him, spt act them, abused them and struck their
heads with his fists. Women became his favorites by
yielding their persona, the huntera, by knocking about jn

_ the woods, and his courtiers by their indecont speech.
* Tho court was fille with the prostitutes, the cun-
ning, the foolish and the rebels; and was unfit for
_ the wise te approach, The king was made to dance
by the sous of Jishnu, like an idol in a machine;
aud they called him scatterer of kanghana and go in-
duced to scatter away to them that kind of ore
ments. They attributed faults to the innocent,
showed new things to the king, insulted noble porsons by
striking thoir heads with fists, and thereby reveived
fuvors from the King. They exposed the rounded brensts
of their wives and thereby induced the passionate king
to their houses, and there got out moncy from him hy
dice. In expectation of mouey, the shameless courtiers
brought their wives to the king, and afterwards asked
him whose wife had given him the greatest plensnre.
Among the courtiers, Hari and Dhirjati were prevented
by their mother from bringing their wives,to the king,
aud so they became beggars, Thus the courtiers made their
wives unchaste, and themselves objects of ridicule.
They sacrificed their long-standing friendship with
others, and sometimes they even lost their wealth.
What was it then that they so eagerly pursued at such
saorifices? Bhatta Phalgnna had been the miniater of
king Yashaskara ; he now served the present king, but
the advices of this niinister who had set up Phalguna-
svémrl and other gods, were ridiculed by the king.

1h+ HINGS OF KASTMIRA,

Old Rakka, the lord of Kampana thirsted for vengeance
and entered among the eyil couttiers of the king. He
act fire to the Jayendvavihdra in order to kill Sanggréme
the Dimara who was inside the building. And in order
to make his name Insting, he brought the images of
Buddha from the burning monasteries and other stones

“from delapidated temples ; and set up Kshemagauti-
shyare by the side of the rond leading to the matket,
When a mau dies, avother enjoys his wealth, making it
his own; but he thinks not that after his death it will
avain goto a third person, Fie to the lust of wealth
deeponad by ignorance. The king bostowed thirty-six
villages which were attached to the several monasteries that
were burnt, to thy lord of Khasha. Sinhardja, governor
vf fort Lohara, martied his daughter ta the king, This
girl’s name was Diddé, aud her mothor’s father was the
Shghi, and the king was yreatly addicted to ber. This
Shahi received rouch wealth from the king, aud set up
Bhimukeshava. Diddé and Chandralekhs danghter of
Phalguna, the Jurd of Dyara, became jealous of each
other.

The king made ill use of advice and instruction in the
use of kuntas (a sort of bayonets) which he uged
in fox hunting. People often found’ him wandering with
his dogs, and with men carrying teaps and boxes, and
with Demvas, aud wanderers of the woods. He spent
his days in fox huuting in the forest of Damodaraat
Lalydna, Shimiku, &e. Oue night, on the fourteenth day

.of the dark moon, while thus hunting he saw fire issuing
fram the mouth of a yelling she-fox. This frightened
him and brought on the Lutamaya fever which ended
his life. In his last moments, he went to the shrine of
Varéha in the neighbourhood of Hushkapura. In this
shrine he built the temple named Kshemamatha, and an-
other named Shrikantha. His body became like masura
{a sort of lentil) on account of Luté, and he died in the
bright lunar fortnight of the month of Powsha) in the
year thirty-four, after a reign of nine years.

His infant son Abhimanyu then ascended tho throne
under the guardiauship” of Diddég who trusted the great
ministers of the kingdom. In this reign a preat fire
broke out near the market of Tunggeshvara, and con-
sumed large houses from the temple of Bard hanasvimt
to the other side of Bhikshuki, all the tract in which
the devil had laid his thread.* It burnt the houses which
the impure king and his Dombsa and his*Chandala re-
latives had’ made impure.

The guardian mother of the king was not a wise
womav, She could not judge right from wrong. When
her husband was living she quarrelled with the duughter
of Phalzuna the chief minister. When her husband
died, she saw that his other wives perished with him,
and was advised by Phalguna to follow their example,
But another humane minister, named Narayghana,

eutreated her, when she was weeping by the funeral
pyer of her husband, not tot die; and Rakka took the
sorrowful queen away from Phalguna. Phalouna was
now afraid of the queon’s resentment, knowing that she
bore grndge against him, and was supported by the
- other ministers, But be had all the authority, aud his
valor and judgment were marked by all. Now when
Kardamaraja went with the bunes of the late king to” the
Gunges, Phalyuua, not venturing to stay at the palace
for fear of his enemies, intended to stop at Parnotsa till
Kardamariija’s return with a powerful army, But when
he had reached Kgshtuvata outsidd the capital with sume
trensinry gaanls, Diddd instigated by Rakka, &e., sont
aving oltb men, with promise of reward, to kill him.
Bat Phalgnna was apprised of it, and returning thence,
he collected his army and went to the shrino of Vurdha.
Hearing that Phalguns had collected his army, aud was
returning, Didd’ aud Ler ministers became apprehensive
of an attack. Phalguna lamented the death of his late
master at Varaha, and laid down his arms at the foot
of the god Variha, This assuaged the fears of the
queen-ravther. It is a great sin to serve him who canuot
judge right from wrong. To oppose him when ke is
angry is au act of rebellion, How can the wise show
their -auger,—by obedience to law, or by resort to arms?
Phalzuna retired to Paruutsa with his army and the
toinisters were as glud ox buys are when their , téacher

Now the queen of Kshemagupta thought day and night
ag to how she would ‘destroy her enemy. Parvvagupta,
when he aspired to the throne, married his two daughters

. to ministers Chhoja and Bhubhata, Mahima and Pétala
were the issues of these marriages and lived in the palace
like princes. They now aspired to the throne, and joined
Himaka and others, They were driven from the palace
by the queen and went to their homes in anger. On one
occasion, when Mahima was away from his house, the
queen sent clubmen to drive him out of the kingdom,
But he knew it beforehand, and took shelter in the house
of his father-in-law Shaltisena. Even there he was pur-
sued and oppressed. Shaktisena was at last able to send
back the clubmen, and there in the house of his father-in-
Inw Mohima at Jast found nu open asylum. He was
then joined by Himmaka, Utkala and Eramatta inhabi-
tants of Parihésapura ; a8 also by Udayagupta son of
Amritékara, and Yashodhara and other iuhabitants of
Lalitédityapura. Thus there were two factions in the
kingdom. ‘In this dilemma, only the minister Naravd-
hana remained faithful to the party of Diddd. The army
of Mahima daily gained strength, and approached the
shrine of Padmusvém{, intending to fight. Didds sent
her son to Shuramatha and began anxiously to think how
to meet the danger. She then gave much wealth ta the
Brihmanas of Lalitgdityapura, aud through their agency
prevented a junction between the different detachments
of the enemy'’sarmy, The Bréhmanas formed themselves

158 KINGS OF KASUMERA,

into a body and effected peace between the queen and .
Mahima. The queen had been hitherto regarded as ip-
capable of action, but the event showed that she was
quite equal to the danger. It was known that she was ,
not capable of leaping over the hollow made by the foot
of acow; but like Hanumdua, she now crossed the sea, J
bow to wealth by which all dangers can be averted. The
queen gave Kampana and other places to Yashodhara and
others, as brite. Within » few days Mahima was des-
troyed through magic, and Diddé reigned supreme,

Now it happened that Yashodhava, lord of Kampana
marched with hs men agaiust Difukkana, the Shahi chief.
He forcibly penetrated to the part of the country fortified
with mountains aud rivers and captured Dhakkana; but
confirmed him in his dignity ou his paying a tribute, Rak-
ka and others indamed the (ju: eu-mother against the lord
of Kampana ; for kings, crystal, and bad women agsume the
eglor of thove that are ner i.em, By speaking in accord-
ance with the temper of the listener the wicked gain
access to the hearts of men, court-flatterers to the hearts
of court zans, and slaves to those of their masters. The
queen believed that the protection given to the wily and
rebelliow: Shahi chief was owing to the bribe given by
hita to the lord of Kampana. And when the victorious
lord. ef Kamnpana returned home, the queen sent clubmen
to deive bum away, Hearing of the insult offered to hin,
and xernembering the former engagement, H irnniaka,
Erarmutta and others became angry, and took offence. But

. Naravéhana, dso. did not forsake the queen, so that there
was a division in the army as before, When Shuvadhara
and the other rebels entered the capital, the queen sent
her son to the temple of Bhattérakd. But the rebels
through some blunder missed that opportunity of de-
posing the queen who was then alone. On the next day
her people assembled and she was able to make a show of
resistance to the enemy. ‘I'he rebels who had stationed
themselves from the temple Jayabhattériks to the temple
Shiiramatha, attacked the queen's men who fed within
the capital in terror, At Sinhadvéra ( the Lion-gate) they
saw the Ekénggas in firm array, who infused courage to
the flying men and led them once more on to battle.
The evemy moved also. At this juncture Rajakulabhatta
arrived and struck panic amongst the enemy's soldiers
and encouraged the queen's party by the sound of Tiirf.
On his approach, the enemy’s soldiers fell in great num-
bers. The gods of war never favor rebels, The powerful
Himmaka‘ struck Réjakulabhatta with sword, but the
mail of the latter protected him, The queen's soldiers
killed Himmaka, and captured Yashodhara, The sword
of Eramattaka who was gallantly fighting was broken, he
fell-from his horse and was captured. Udayagupta, ano-
ther of the rebel chiefs who was sought by the soldiers to
be placed at their head, fled from the battle. The queen's
porty won the victory, They captured Yashudhara, Shu-
bhddhare, Mukula with their friends, with whom the queen
was very angry. Eramattaka had stopped the payment

of tax levied at Gayé on all Késhmirians performing
funeral rites in that place! The queen caused him tp
be thrown into the Vitasté suspending a large piece of
stone to his neck, and thus punished him for his evil
action, Those ministers too, who from the reign of
Gopdéla to that of Abhimanyu, were rebelling and creat-
ing anarchy and murdering kings in the kingdom, were
now destroyed by the queen, with their families ond
servants. She bestowel Kampana &c. to Rakka and
others, The great minister Naravghaua thus made the
widow queen, sole mistress of the kingdom, and in
gratitudo to him, the queen addressed him in the assembly
of ministers as Rajéuaka, a title second only to that
of the king. The queen slept after the minister had
slept, she ate after ho had eaten, she was happy when he
was so, and sorry when he was grieved, She always
enquired after his health, asked his advice, and gave him
whatever he ‘wished to have.

There lived a charioteer named Kupya wlio had two
sons camed Sindhu and Bhuyya, of whom the elder
Sindhu wad a flatterer, He had been treasurer of Parvva-
gupta, and afterwards became the treasurer and favo-
rite of the queen, Ha built another treasury office
nayned Sindhugangja. Now this wicked person said to
the queen that Naravéhaua had very uigh had usurped
her kingdom. ‘The queen believed what ha said. At
this time Nuvavghana once invited the queen to a nieal

sho weut there, she would be murderod. The queen
" became alarmed, and asked bis advice as to what should
be done. She privately returned from tho way, to her
polace, aud intimated as an excuse, that sho had just
then het monthly courses. The minister suspected the
motive of the queon, and the good terms which existed
betveen him and the queen ceased. From that time
the “syil counsellor sowed ill fecling between them.
Thera is nothing which bad men cannot destroy. Hvil
counsellors are more foolish thdn boys, and wisor than
Vrihaspati, Fie to the creation of Vidhété, in which
wisdom and foolishness’ are alike displayed. The queen
was ili spoken of by all for this conduct of hers, Nara-
vihona was so excited by insults, day by day that he
committed suicide, What but death is left to the spirited
aud high minded when insulted Wy oue against whom
there is no remedy. On his death, the kingdom became
éven as night without moon or words without trath.

The queen mother sow became hardened by ber cruel-
ties, and thought of murdering the children of Sanggréma
the Démara. They therefore fled to their country in
the North, killing Kayyaka the lord of Dviza and others
employed to murder them. Alarmed at having pro-
yokel them, she instead of feeling shame, for the selfish
never feel sharae, managed to get them again together.
Whereupon Sthéneshvara and other Damaras, both great
anliowW, became alarmed, and waited before the qneen.
She on her part was aguin alarmed at the accumulation

of eo many Damaras and called back Phalguna, now
that Rakka was dead. Phalguna had once laid dow his
arms, but he took them up again to administer thie
country. It is hard to resist the temptation of enjoy-
ment, He had once had conquered R&japurf and other
places, but now that he was old his past glory was of no
servico to him,—even like a prostitute when she begomes
aged. .

The queen was excessively grieved at the death of her
son whose infant sun Nandigupta became king. For a
shurt time, the queen remained sunk in grief and did not
exercise much cruelty. And from that time she became
religious, The superintendent of the city, named Bhuyya,
brother of Sindhu, and a good man, was her adviser in
her pious dees, She was now once more loved by all,

" Abbimanyupura, and an image of a god, named Abhi-
manyusvémi, She then went to Diddapura and set up
a god Diddésvimi, and a temple for the convenience of
travellers from ihe interior of the country, For the
benefit of her dead husband, she built Kangkanapura, and |
there set up an image of another god (Vishnu) of white
stole which was also called Didddésvamf. Sho also built
a large house (a sarai) for the Késhmfrians and for her
own countrymen (the people of Lohara.) Sheset up a
god named Sindasvém{ after her father’s name, and
built 8 house for the dwelling of the Brdhmanas of her
country, At thejunetion of the Vitasté and the Sindhu,
she built temples and houses of gods, and made the place
holy. She built in all sixty-four images of gods. She re-
paired the part of the city, which was injured by fire; and
built stone walls to the temples. Her female servant
Valgé of Vaivadhika casie, who used to support this

month of Agrahégyana, on the fifth bright lunar day, she
killed Ler uther grandson named Tribhuvaua,
Tho last surviving yrandson Bhimagupta, was coronated
by the cruel queen, in order to be murdered. In the
meantime the minister Phaiguna was murdered, It was
through hin that her atrocities were partly concealed
from the public. She now appeared to tho subjects
in her hideous chavacter. The character of a woman
though born of high fumily, is low even as a river which

He had a son narnud Trangga who tended buffaloes. This
maa with his Jive brothers came tu Kashmira, and entered
the service of the minister for war and peace; and was
employed tu carry letters. He once brought a letter to
the queen, sha saw him, and fell in love with him. And
though she enjoyed the intimucy of mauy persons, still
she touk this man to her favor. This shameless and vi-
civus queen while living with Tungga murdered Bhuyya

, lost. And to Rakka’s son, the shameless Dovakalasha
"aged to procure paramours for her, the queen gave the
post of Veldvita lately occupied by Bhuyya. Even
Kardamargja and others who were warriors and lords
of Dvgva did the same mean service for her. After o
residence of four or five years in the palace, the infant
king grow to be asensible boy. He saw that the laws of
the kingdom were bad, and that it was necessary to re-
form them; and he observed that his grand-mother’s
charactor was disreputable, It was owing to the private
instructions of Abhimanyu’s widow that the young king
turned go good. The*crucl and sinful queen became
alarmed and guided by tho advice of Devakalasha, and
without feeling auy shame, openly bound the king, This
act of hers cleared the doubt which the people had of
the queen’s guilt in respect of the murder of Nandigupta,
And having put Bhimagupta to death after much torture,
she usurped the throne in the K. E. 56. ,

Tungga,-to whom the queen became every day more
and more attached, at last superseded all, and became
tha chief minister. The old ministers made peace with
Tungga and his five brothers, in order to conceal their
atterapt to effect a yevolution in the kingdom, They
consulted with the inhabitants of Kgsbmira, and oalled
in the son of the queen’s brother, the spirited Vigraha-
réja, who again brought in some Bréhmanas to perform
certdin’ ceremonies for the success of their effort. Tha
Brikmanas advised the murder of Tungga, and the

oppressed people began to seek for Tungga in order to
kill him. Diddé shut up Tungg ga ina room, and waited
for few days apprehending an attack. She bribed
Sumanomattoka and other Brdhmanas with her gold,
The intended attack, being thus bonght off Vigra-
haraja was obliged to retire. Tungga was once more
safe in his place and killed Kardamargja and others who
had attempted rebellion. Sulakkana son of Rakka, and
other chief ministers were oither exiled or allowed

remain in the court according ag Tungga and hia
partisans were angry or pleasod with them. Vigraha-
réja again began secretly to ongage tha Brahmanas to
his party. But Tungga came upon them and captured
tho Bréhmanos who were bribed. One Aditya, a favorite
of Viyraharija attempted to fly, but was caught by the
goldiera and killed. Vatsargja, a fullower of Vigrahorgja
was fying, but was wounded and captured. Tungga bound
Sumanomattaka and other Brélmanas, and sent them
to prison. .

On the death of Phalguna, the king of Rajapuri be-
came very iusolent, which led to an attack on him by the
ministers of Kishuira. In the battle which ensued with
Prithvipila, commander of the Réjapuri forces, many
were destroyed on either side. Two of the ministers
of Késhinira Shipgtaka aud Hansorgjn perished. But
Tuvgga with his brothers suddenly entered the city by
another way, and set iton fire, The Réjapuri armas well
ai Prithvipila aud their king were defeated, and the king

‘now humbled consented to pay tribute to Tungga ; so
that Tungga recovered the money which was spent in the
war, Returning to the capital of Kishmfra, the power-
ful Tungga accepted the lordship of Kampana and des-
troyed the villages of the Démaras.

Diddé fearlessly mace Sanggrémardja, the son of her
brother Udayargja, Yuvaréja. Her selection was made
in the following manner. In order to test her nephews
who were all young, she threw some fruits among them,
aud wished to oy) who could gather most. The princes
began to quarrel with one another, She saw that while
many of thom had gathored tho fruits, after being
touch beaten by thei comrades, Sanggrémargjn had
gathered many without being hurt at all, She then
asked him the cause of his success, to which he replied ;
“Taet the others to quarrel and gathered the fruits without
being hurt. For who does not gain his end by inducing
others to danger and keeping himself aloof.”* The queen
heard his-wily words, and according to her feminine
judgment thought him fit for the kingdom. The hero
meditates conquest by strength, and the timid by wiles.

In the K. E. 89 in the month of Vaédra, on the
eighth bright lunar day, the queen died, and the Yuvardja
became king. Thisis the third change in dynasties
effected by women. On the destruction of the Kantaka
dynasty (whose history is narrated in this book) that of

[Invocation to Mowgpeva,]

Kine Kehamapati was very grave and powerful. After
the death of the queen, another attempt was made to
destroy Tungga. But it failed, and his enemies lived to
see his increasing glory. At this time Chandrgkara died ;
he wasn great warrior, aud worthy of being aminister. He
was known to the king, At this time also died the heroic
sons of Punyskarn in the village of Bhimatika; and as
there were none worthy°of the post of minister, the king
roluctantly fuvorerl the party of Tuugga, ‘The late queen,
at the time of hor doath, had bestowed wealth on Tungga
and his people, so that they might not quarrel with the
king. The king was incapable of work even for the

tion to Tungga, and led a life of pleasure, What
moxe shall-I say of the king's meanness! He compro-
mised his glory by making allunce with an unworthy
family. For he gave his daughter Lothiké to Prema the
headman of the Diddé temple, because Prema was a
powerful man and might help him in his danger. fo
iustead of marrying his dv.yhter to n priuce, he married
her to a beggar Bréhmana,

At Paribgsapure the Bréhmana ministers caused magic
to be ‘performed for the fall of Tungga. The revolution

Brahmana ministers, was like the union of violent wind and
fire, This the king came "to know and felt greatly in-
anited thereby. They then attempted to destroy the
king. Sajja and others were requested by the Brgimanag
to join the conspiracy for the overthrow of the king,
snd thoy agroed to it. But when the magical oporation
was nearits coinpletion. The king gainod them over
by a lgrge bounty, and the conspiracy was divulged.
The Dighmanas fled in fear to the honso of Rajakalasha
who had instigated the act. téjakalasha, whose wiles
were now discovered, fought with obstinacy. But the
Bedhmanas fled by a seoret waf, and Igjakalasha was
overcome, The seveu ministers, song of Shridhara then
maintained the straggle but fell also, After their death,
Rajnkalasha was defeated by Sugandhistha Tungga’s
brother and was brought bound by order of Tungga.
On his way along the Skanda road, his guards made
him dance, *wounrded and disarined as he was. <Ano-
ther minister named Bliitiknlasha (partisan of Raja-
kalasha) was also defeated and he thd with his aon

and went awny bruken hearted and accompanied by

, Tungga. But the sooret oozed out, and Tungga came to

know of it, and Bhiétikalasha with his son was agnin
sent to exile by the king. At this time died Mayyémat-
taka son of Chandrakara, who was just rising to prospe-
rity. And Prema who was the king’s son-in-law, and
had done some good to the country died then; as also
Ganggé aud other favorites of the king. Only Tunggs
aud his brothers survived. Thus perished all of whom
Tungga had been afraid. Ile was like a tree on the
silo of a river, from whose base the earth is washed
away by the waved aul which therefore threatens to fall 5
but the waves bring Uack the soil and make its base
firm again,

Tangya had administered the kingdom justly, and to the
benefit of the people, but now his senso began to fail
him. Te took as his assistant a low-born Kayastha
named Bhadreshvata,

He entrusted the manayement of the king’s household
to his wicked assistant in exclusion of the virtuous and
the high minded. He deprived the Brghmanags and the
helpless and the king’s dependants of their livelihood.
Eveu the hardhearted wen these who carry the dead &c.,
feed heir own kith and kin, but this man killed his own
relations. It was in the month of Chnitra that Tungga
took this man into his favor, and in A’shéra Sugandhi-
siha, Tungea’s brother died. He was a great help to brs
brother and by his death Tungga thought himself depriv-
ed of the best member of his body.

his country in the month of Mérgashirsha. He was
accoinpanied by a largo and powerful army with fenda-
tory chiefs and ministers and Rajpoots. The Shahi
welcomed them to his country, and advanced to meet
them; and they spent five or six days in pleasure and
congratulation, Shéhft saw their want of discipline and
told them that since they did not mean to fight with the
Turwhkas, they might remain at case at the flank
ofa hill, Rut Tuneva did not accept this good advice
and hens welfas his army wos farxions for the battle.
The Késhmirians croased the river Toushi, and destroyed
tho detuehment of soldiers sent by Mammfra to reconnoi-
tre. But though the Kashmiriaus wore cager for the
fight, the wise Shahf repentedly alvised them to take

The General of the Turks was woll versed in-the tactics

His body bled, and he looked like Mah&deva wrapt in the
flames of the last fite with which the world is to ba
destroyed. After facing his numerous foes clad in mail,
he at last retreated, and the enemy overran a large
tract of the country. Hammira though victorious in
the field felt himself ill at ense on witnessing the super-
human heroism of Trilochanapila, The Shghf took
shelier in Hiastika and made great efforts te retrieve his
fortune, Thus have I briefly narrated the fall and ex-
tinction of the litie of Shahf, and now the very existence
of his kingdom of which I have spoken in the history of
Shangkaravartama, hei become an abject of doubt,
Fate accomplishes what appears improbable even in
dream, and what cannot even be conceived. Tungga
returned to his country, but the king of Kashmira as
forbearing as he was devoid ambition, was not angry
with him for his cowardly flight in the battle. Still
Tungga was very much grieved. His son Kandarpasinha
was proud of his wealth and his heroism and lived ina
kingly style which gave his father much annoyance,
Vigrahargja the king’s brother privately wrote to the
king advising him to kill Tungga. But the king remem-
bered the last injunction of the late queen, and for a
long time romaiued unsettled. Urged, however, by
repeated letters he at last said tu the carriers of the
epistles that he seldom saw Tungea alone with his son,
snk if he was found alone the deed might be attempted.
“For if you make an attempt on his life when he is not

be un opportunity.” Tho messengers remembered the
advice of the king, and tried to find Tungga alone,
Within six months from this time the king sent for
Tunzga, and though he had dreomt an evil dream, still
he went out of his house aloue with his son, Tungga
entered the king’s court, and there remained in his
presence for a short time, after which he went into the
council chamber with fivo or six servants, He was
fullowed by Pava, Sharka and others, who without saying
auything to the king began to strike Tungga with their
woapuns, Sinharatha, born of the line of Mahératha
waa the minister of king Shangkaravarmmé, and was the
most dutiful of Tungga’s attendants. Though without
arms, still ha tried to save Tungga by throwing himaelf
over him. But Tunggo was killed at the first blow, and
the king was rejoiced. The wicked Kangka and Pértha
the son ofthe court Brihmane Dharmma an enemy of
Tungga, were present on the spot. They placed their
fingers on their lips, in fear, (perhaps to signify thereby
that they would not interfere in the least) and threw
down their arms to save themselves. Changga and the
other ministers who were also present, though friendly to
Tungen and armed, stood still in fear like women.
The -king cut off the heads of Tungga and his son and
thraw them outside the palace in order to encourage his
own men aud dishearten the followers of Tungga, so that
they might not in ignorance of their master's fate still

master’s head and fled, véry few showed any zeal for
their master. One only named Bhujangga son of a
Bréhmana feudatory chief entered the chamber and pur-
sued the king from room to room, He broke open the
doors and killed twenty warriors in the king’s court,

fray, went to some shrine to assunge his grief for the
death of hig inuster. Others though they did not venture
to fight, were killed by the king’s partisans, Chandré-
khyo who considered himself a warrior, Arjjuna and
Deléchakra the Démara, though they threw down their
arms, were killed by the king’s party. Tungga died on
the twelvth day after the new moon in the month of
Ashira. His house and property were plusdered by the
king. After the death of Tunggs and his son, who were
not rebels, the wily people gained ascendancy in the
palace. Naga the brother of Tungga who had abused the
ears of the king with evil council, and was in fact the
cause of the destruction of his brother and brother's
son, and was itl spoken of by men, was now made lord
of Kampana by the king. Kshemi wife of Kandarpa-

judgment of the king than that he gave good poss to
Partha and others. The vory wicked Partha who was
known to live in oriminal intimacy with" the wife of his
brother, was by the king made the superintendent of tho
city. Partha polluted the shrine of Pravarésha by mur-
ders, Matangga son of Sindhua very miserly man and an
oppressor of the people began to argment the treasure
of the avaricious king.

Now in former times there lived one Devamukha of
Divira caste who had a son named Chandramukha by a
prostitute, e& woman who used to sell cakes, &c. By
‘Tungga’s favor he had been made one of the king's
dependants, aol had amassed great wealth. Though
rich he was avaricious, and when presented with cakes
he used to he angry with his servants. In his poverty
he had been healthy, but in his days of prosperitg he
lost bis good digestion and health. And so the people
used te jeer him. He did one virtuous act at the time
of his death. He gave one-third of one koti (of tha

vora. His sons Nandinukha ond others were “on bad

of regiments by the king, "It was ridiculons to bestow
on them the post of Tunggn. They were sent against
the Turks, like Tungga, but they fled to their country.
The king was weak, and the ministers worthy of him,
an consequently the Diviras and Dimaras of Darad
rebalicd.

Of tho buildings erected in this reign, the following
may be enumerated. Lothike the kino’s daughter built
a temple called after her name, and another after the
name of her mother Tilottamaé. Even the vicious aspire
to virtnous acta for even Bhadreshvara built a raonas-
tery. Tho king did not build any edifice with his own
money.

was parsimonious.

On the first of Ashdrain the year four of the Kgsh-
mirmu era the King died bequeathing his kingdom to his
son Hariréja,

two days this good king dfed on the eighth day after
the new moon, Lives are like stars of the summer
night, which set soon after they are seen. It is said
that his unchaste mother removed him by a secret charm
, because he resented her bad behaviour.

The queen mother Shilekha was ambitious of reigning
and went to the coronation-bath, every thing being ready
for the ceremony. But in the meantime the Ekdéngens
joined by Séyara son of the king’s nurse, coronated the
boy Auantwlova brother of tho late king. The queen
ouly reaped the sim of taurderify her Child for tho
kiugdom, while another enjoyed it, Hyen as the serpent

Her disappointment was so great that sha forgot her
affection fur her son. Fie tu the craving for enjoyment !

Vigrahargjx, the aged uncle (father’s brother) of the
new king approached the kinydom to usurp it. He
brought a powerful army from Lohara, and within
two aud half days entererl the capital after having
burnt the gate when it was carelessly guarded. But
when within the templa of Lothiké he and his fullumera
were killel by the army sent by Shrflekhd. She then
built ,two temples fur the benefit of her husband’s and

Siill Rédeapéla remained a beggar as he was, though
paid one and half lacs daily while Diddapdla was happy
with eighty thousand a day. Ananggapéla the Vetéla

He saw on the battle field the wopuded Ekinggas who.
were uamod to him one after unother; he was touched
with pity, and relieved their anxicty as regards the
gratuity due to them for their wounds. The grateful
king bestowed ninety-six kotis of Diundras on them.
And so great was the king’s magnanimity that he gave
some money even to Tribinvana. The king held his
aword so firinly during the buttle, that he could not let
go his hold when tho battle was over, but after long
mill-fomentation. “

The king made his friont Breahmardja treasurer, but
he excited tho jealousy of Riidrapéla and consequently
had to retire. Ho then joined the seven Mlechchha
kings and the Damaras, and placing tho king of Darad
at their head entered Kaishmira. When they arrived
at the village Ksbiraprishta, the gallant Ridrapgla went
out to fivht with them. It was settled that the battle
wag to comnmience the next day, and the lord of Darad
went into the house of Kridgpindaraka the Néga. There
contrary to the advice uf thuse around him, he threw his
bayunet (Kunta) on a fish that was fluating in the water,
wherenpon there arose from the place a serpent, having
the body of a jackal, and the lord- of Darad chased it.
His army saw him run, and thought that the engagement
of fighting ou the succeeding day had been violated, aud
apprehending an attack from the enemy, rushed to battle.
In the battle which raged, the lord of Darad -lost ‘his
head, and the fume of Rddrapéla increased. ,The

Miechchha kings wore killed or imprisoned, ond the
king of Késhmf{ra obtained gold and jewels. Ridrapéla
brought to his master the head of the king of Darad with
crown adorned with pearls, Udayanavatsa brother of
the deceased, caused magic to be performed by the
Bréhmanas and Raédrapgla died of Lit. The other sons
of Shéhi were also soon removed.

When the Palas the favorites of the king were dead,
Stiyyamati becamg his most beloved. This queen other-
wise called Sabhata set up Shiva on the banks of the
Vitestd, aud a temple called Subhatématha, and at the
timo of sanctifying the yod and temple she removed the
poverty of many Brahmanas by bestowing on them cows,
horses, gold and jewels. By its side she built a village
fur Brdélmanas, with a temple, and named the village after
that uf A’shachandra alias Kallana, her younger brother
whom she loved. By it she erected twu other temples
to Vijayesha and Amaresha and called thém after the
names of Sillana her another brother, and of her
husband. In Vijuyeshvara she gave one hundred and
eight villages inhubited by Braéhmanas to holy and learned
Bréhmanas. In Amareshvara she bestowed (on Br&éhmanas)
villages inhabited by ~the same caste people, and called
after hur husband; and she erected Trisdla, Vanalingga
und other images of Shiva, When their son Rajargja died,
buth the king and the queen left the palace and lived
new the, temple of Saddshiva. From this time the

ing kings dwelt near this temple. '

The grooms of the king’s stable became rich, partly
by royal gifts, for the king loved horses, and partly by .
plunder.

There was one Dallaka, the Daishika who was a grent
jester and favorite of the king. This was the wan
through whom Bhoja kizg of Malava built a golden tank,
and it was through him that he fulfilled bis resolution
to wash his face always with the waters from the
shrine of Papaswlana, Tle tao robbed the people.
He used to prepare betcls with perfumes," and the
king gave him almost all his riches. ‘The king, for the
further payment of this man's dues, mortgaged to him,
rich as he was now, the throve and crown marked with
the design of peacock’s tail. Every month these things
were brought from the betel man’s house on the day of
worship, At last the king stopped these excesses by
siving charge of his treasury to his queeis Stiyyamatt.

named Keshava, a Bréhmana and an inhabitant of
Trigarta. People had previonsly seon this man poor
and alone walking in the streets! Fortune is as fleet-
ing as lightning in the clouds!

Jn Gourishatridash&luya there lived a Vaishya named
Présdidapala, and he had three sons named Haladhava,
Vajra and Varéhe, Of them Haladhara was favored by
the queen, and at last became the prime minister.
Both the king and the queen took his advica on every
occasion, Haladhara completed aud cnlargod the building
begun by Kshoma, The custom of registering the color
and value of gold by private individuals in a public office,
thereby publishing an account of the wealth of indi-
viduals, was discontinued by this minister, so that future
kings might not oppress the rich. He stopped oppression
over the people by killing some of the king’s grooms
who plundered them of their wealth and women. At
the junction of the Vitasté and the Indus, he built a
golden teraple. There he also built another temple
and founded villages which were inhabited by Bréhmanas.
His brothers and sons were rich and liberal, Vimba
his nephew, son of Varéha, a great warrior and a rich
man, went out toa distant country on some business,
He killed many Damaras, and at last perished in a
battle with the people of Khasha in which he refused to
fly thotigh his followers were few. The king deposed
Sala king of Champ4, aud set up another in his place.

184 KINGS oF KAsmMiRa.

The king fell into difficultjes several times by-
suddenly entering foreign kingdoms without previoys
advice or plan. Once at Valla4pura where his army was
reduced in an attack on Kalasha son of Tukka, he wag
rescued from danger by the device of Haladhara. On
another occayion, when he entered Urashé his passage
was cut off by the enemies, and he was rescued by the
lord of Kampana who cleared the passage, and gave
the king an outlet. The king showed great courage
when in danger. .

The Démaras who inhabited Krama killed Raéjeshvara
lwrd of Dvara and son of Bhadreshvara, as well as many
uthers, Ee who serves royalty must always have a fall.
Because the queen favored Haladhara, evil rumour began
to spread regarding them; and Ashachandra the queen's
youngest brother, arrested him and confiscated his pro-
perty. But the king liberated him, and he prospered
again. On account of the qneen’s favor he experienced
plosperity and misery alternately, even like san and shade
ona rainy dey.

(iradually the simple king became henpecked, a cir-
“unistance which becaine the cause of his misfortunes.
By the advice of the queen who was blind in her affee-
tuon fur her son, the king mude preparations to abdicate
his kingdom to his son Kalasha, though in this he was
upposed by wise Haladhara and other wisemen. “ You
will repent of this” said his ministers to him. Jn spite
uf this advice however, he coronated his gun Ravdditya

pine on the sixth of Srévana, bright moon.
This new king had a high notion of his sovereign
dignity, and heartlessly told his father that he should
address him by the title of Deva. The father stared at
him in anger, but the son said smiling ‘when even the
kings of Kanouje and other places address me in that way,
what else should you do who have deposed yourself.
Every day you shall feel such humiliation for even the
Rishis cannot forego their pride.” The late king remem-
bored the words of his ministers, and could not give any
reply. On another day, Haladhara seeing the boy served
hy other kings, and the father with few followers, pre-
tended to be angry with the latter, and so managed to
give the kingdom back to him. Taladhara reproached
him and enquired if he was not ashamed to remain at case,
hurdening the little boy with the weight of the kingdom.
“Take upon yourself” he contiuned “the tmanagement
af the kinglom. aud let the youth enjoy the pleasures
ff his age.” Ha said se, aud by this artifice managed
to give buck the kingdoin tu the vld man and to deprive
the boy of it, The flutter now became king only in
naure; and had to pend on his parents even for his
food. In wecustome 1 worship of weapons the boy ws

became jealous of her son's, wiveg when they adorned
themselves as befitted queens; and made them the ob-,
jecta of ridicule till they ceased to adorn their houses.

One day Kshitirgja son of Vigraharaja the old king’s
father’s brother came to king Ananta and with lamentation
told him that his son Bhuvavardja was aspiring to his
(Kshitiraja’s) throne and that bis grandson Nila had
already usurped the kingdom and had made preparation
to oppuso the intended attack of his father Bhubanardja.
That Nila bad vested dogs with the holy threads of
Bréhmanasi and called these after the names of holy men
revered by his father, Kshitiraja afterwards left all
worldly concerns, for even his wives wero against him;
and uominating Utkersha son of Kalasha by queen
Ramalekhé, an infaut yet in its mother’s breast, as heir,
travelled in holy places in the company of learned men,
aud after enjoying peace fur many years, died at Ubakra-
dbara, adevout Vishuuvite. He and his contemporary
king Bhoja were both renowned for charity nnd learning
and fur being alike friends to the poets. King Ananta
made Tanvangyardéja (his father’s brother's son) the guar
dian uf his grandson. This Tanvangga enlarged the
kingdom of his ward, and when tra grew up, returized tu
Kgsbuira and died at Chakradhara.

The Ling took the advice of his kinsmen and a re-
yolutivu was caused by them. One Jinduraja son
of Madanardja sou of Siddhargja son of Buddbardja
son of Induréju who was proud of his heroism,

was sent against tho kings of Darad, but he was
cplled by the queen in her house and made to ac-
cept the post of minister. Tho K&shmirians lost the
battle. The Damaras too, to the grief of tho queen, rose
in rebellion, Jinduraéja attacked and killed the rebel
Damara chief named Shobha a blind man and an in-
habitant of Degrima. The king created Jiadurdja lord
of Kampana, and made R4japuri and other places tribu-
taries to Kashmira.

At this timo tho minister Halndhara died. He was
aa a stuff in the slippery path of king Auanta’s
regu. When on his death-bed at Chakradhara he was
visited by the king and the queen for wivice, he told
the king not to attack another biugdem hastily, ond
when in dauger to try to sive his life first. Jindurdja”
he continued “you must regard him who has suddenly
risen to power, with suspicion ; aud Juyananda will breed
quarrel between you anil your son.” According to this
advice of the dying minister the king caused the powerful
Jindurdja when he was unarmed, to be captured by
Vijja.

Now in the course of time, prince Kalasha the nominal
king eas led by his scrvants to evil ways. There wera
the princes of the family of Shahi named Vijja, Yittha,
Rajapd4ja and another who used to excite the prince to
evil acts, and became his favorites, Jayénanda too the
son of the treasurer Naga, who was always by the person
of this prince king, taught him dishonest things. The

king’s religious instructor Amarakgntha being dead, he
became the disciple of Amara’s son Pramadakantha. Thys
the king naturally of bad character, had for his guru, a
man who advised evil things, and who was indiy
criminate in his intercourse with women. This man
boldly lived in criminal intercourse with his own daugh-
ter. There were some who were proud of their prowess,
and used to gv about in the streets at night. One night
they fell down through fright and had their knees broken.
But their wounds were cured by a cat merchant by siiaply
pasaing his hands over their heagds. This man had a cal

name being forgotten. He was really a great dunce,

Thus men of nu veal merit hoodwinked the king and
held him completely in their power. The king’s com-
ynions kept up nights, ate much but could not digesi,
the hing too spent nights with them in musio, drinking
wine, and forcing women to their company. The

gained much reputation. He discarded his low origin
and thanked hia broken nose. Thus the excited and
shameless king did what should not be told, still I shall
deacrihe it because it comes in the way of my narra-
tive. The king who loved to enjoy other peoples’ wives
did not spare his sister Kalland and his daughter Néga.
The vld king (the present king’s father) who lived in
retirement with his wife, was much grieved to hear of
this, though he said nothing.

There lived a beygyar Bréhbmaua named Lushtakw, an
inhabitant of Ovand of which village he was the sooth-
sayer, One wight when he was coming from the house
of Sanggrimakshetrapdla, he happened to say correotly
what was within the closed fist of another, and so he gained
much reputation, and this man of lust was made the
yuru, the yoothsnyer and the prucurer of the king.

By those and other fatterers, the kiug was blinded
and he came to consider guilty actions as meritorious.
Words said in jest were good words with him, his valor
consisted in oppression over his people and he showed his
shamelessness and gallantry by intercourse with women
who should not be touched. His simplicity was apparent
by kis putting up rith the abuse of the wicked; and
nothing of what his flatterera did, was Jeft undone by
him, because it was bad. Always knocking about from
house to huuse tu steal the embraces of other men’s wives,
he felt no pleasure in the embraces of his own wives at
night. His pleasures were planned by vthers, and his

love of other people's wives began to increase. One night
accompaniod by five or six procurers, he stole into the
house of Jinduraja, whose daughter-in-law (son's wife) who
was as bad as a prostitute, invited the king by sigus.
When he entered the house the doy barked, and the Chan-
Gélas thinking it was a thief, ran with clubs, The king
through fonr, fell on the ground, and they were going to
beat him, when his followers sheltered him with their
bodies. But when they were thrashed they cried out,
aud said that it was king Kalasha ; and so the Chandélas
were stopped. Surely this mishap came to pass because
the kiug went to his engagement placing his noge-lesa
cvurtier in the front. He went ont in disappointment
captivated with the ginnce of tho girl, but did not escape
the eyes of the pnasers by in the streets. Even the
king was insulted by the low people, because he did
unkingly things owing to the baseness of his heart.
Even gods afe insulted for unruly passions, how then can
mortals escape with undefiled honor, When- the heart
turns towards what is evil every thing gets confused.
First of all, the man gets evil name, and then his evil
desires are known. Virtue perishes first and then honor.
Men doubt the fact of his being born in a good femily,
and then his life becomes endangered.

That very night when the wicked king returned to
his capital, his parents heard of the affair. And after
weeping fur a long time for shame, grief and filial’ affec-
tion, they determined to capture him, they spent that

KINGS or KASHMfRa. 191

night in resolving to coronaze the learned Harsha the
ekiest of their grandsons and son of Vappika (Kalasha).
On the morning they sent for the king; but Vijja and
Jayavanda warned the Intter against seeing his parents,
Led by the haud by Jayduanuda aud followed by Vijja
the king went to his parents. But no sooner had he
gone, there than his father gave a slap on his fuce
and told him to leave aside his weapon, Vijja supported
the frightened kiyg with his hand and touching his
weapon proudly said to tha oll nan. “ Being the most
honorable of nen, O king! why do you forget that
honorable men can never forsake their honor? I receive
pay, and am a Rajpoot, and armed, how then can I Jeave
him in danger as long as Lam alive? You are the father,
he the son, when we are away do what you think fit,”
Having stopped the tongue of the old king with worda
both harsh and mili, Vijja brought away the king from
his father; and men admired Vijja for his apeech before
the ex-king. Fortunately for the king, his mother who was
a very angry woman, said nothing ; for had her anger been
roused Kalasha would either have been brought under dis-
cipline or imprisonal. Vijja then hastily took the king
to ché house of Dilnd the I.vurite qneen. She was
informed of all that had hey pend, aml pretending thet
the king was suffering fiom: headache, besmeared the
head cf the frightened suveruign, with oil, and by this
means she prevented the entrance of any other peraun,
placed Vijja at the duur uud sholtered her Luaband.

On the other hand when the otker persons had gone
away, the mother of the king rebuked her husband, and
on the pretence of looking to tha welfare of her son
went to him. When she came there to reconcile the father
and the son, the king was alone and Vijja at the door.
But the qneen mother was denied admittance, whereupon
the old king became angry ancl prepared himself to go to
Vijayakshetra, When he with his wife had gone near
to Padmapura, Vishchavata and other Bréhmana inhabit-
ants of the place thus addressed him, “Why do you
repent after having yourself abdicated your kingdom |
whatever you may have done, whether good or bad, you
should not now repent. You should have rebuked your
bad son considering that you have not resigned your sub-
jects to his evil will, The king is powerless nas a doll
set on a machine; that he is cither good or bad is owing
to the virtue or sin of his subjects, even as clouds dis-
churge rain or thunderbolt according to the virtue or sin
of trees. You are wishing to enjoy pleasure’ away from
your wicked son, but how can that be fulfilled since you
are leaving behind your trensures. For who cares to
touch aman however worthy and well-born and pure
if he be withuut wealth like a’Sword sharp and bright,
but withont the scabbard.” When the old king heard
thus, he thought of returning, and his son came to the
spot with his wife, and tried to assuage his anger. The
old mau entered the capital still ¢ angry: aud took away all

skirts, &ce. Tho ladies of the house loaded the boat
with soveral articles, and did not leave even a peg in the
house. The people at first knew nothing of the affair
and remained silent, but whon they were aware that the
old king was going away from the place they began to
weep, and with tears showered flowers on the departing
king. Nothing olao was heard in the streets but
lamentations, and, cries of * O! mother,” © O! father”
“where are you, going hence ;” uid when the voice of
lamentations had gradually ceased in the streets, the
sounds of sighs were heard like the sound of fountain
on the hills, And the ear of the old king and bis quecn
became so accustomed to the cries that they fancied they
heard such sounds in the air evon when they had depart-
ed, They were so shocked with the evil conduct of the:r
sun that they blamed even the birds for feeding their
young oues. They then reached the shrine uf Vijaye-
shvara aud their hearts were soothed of the troubles on
recount of their sou. There they passed their days in
devotion and lived with their servants. The persons
who fullawed him to the shrine were Tauvanggnrdja,
Tangga &e., the princes; his kinsmen, and Surpyavarma,
Chandra, &e , and the Damuras. The Damaraa and king
Kshira were stationed by hin in theiy own towns; but
they also served as his guard. The old king kept his

Vijayokshetra, according to the Kashmirian era, was 55.0

When his futher was gone, Kulasha found his trea-
suries empty. Though without money, he still wished
to improve his kingdom, and consulted Vijja and others,
and made those whom he knew well, his ministers,
Jayéoanda was made prime minister and Varaéhadeva
born in a place on the Vitnasté was made the lord of
Dvdra. He also made Viyayamitra, lord of Kampana.

Who destroyed the king of Darat and others? And

sengers, this mesiavy sent by his mother, he with-
drew his army that very wight, The queen mother
heard of this, and filled with affection for ber sun, went
to her husband iu the morning, and rebuked him. The
battle was thus averted by the queen. But through
the advice of bad men the minds of beth father and the
son sometime remained clouded. It was natural under
such: circumstinces shat the peace established between
them should be frequently disturhed. When not in the
company of his queen, the ull king became very often
incensed at the acts of his sou; but when she was near,
she “used to aysuaye his anger, Thus every day he

esembled the lake in autamn, alternately disturbed
and tranquil, The son destroyed the houses of hig
father's partisans, bat the father was under the influence
by his queen, and did nothing to the partisans of his
son. Tormented by the qneen who doted on her son
aml by harsh words of his followers, the old king always
remained grieved. Tle intended to suatch the kingdom
from his son whose army and partisans he believed
to bo weak, except only Jindurgja whom he considered
to be somewhat powerful, With this purpose he invited
the fons of Tanvangya who bad ounuty with Kalasha
to reign over the country, The queen saw this
danger to her dynasty and sent messengers that very
night te iuvite Harsha with a view te make him king.
Invited by the messengers of his grand-nother, Harsha
felt sume encouravenient. We freed himself! from the

When the young prince, Kalashas son, went to the alt
king, Kalushs trembled for fear. He wished for peace and
desisted from his ill-advised attempts against his purents.
He sent miessenyera to them, stopped all disturbances in

and the sacred things itrcontained. The queen was
grieved to see every thing destroyed and attempted to
commit suicide, but was foreed out of the burning
house by the sons of Tanvangga. On the preceding
night the soldicrs had taken off their clothes when
going to bed; and when they rose the next morning
they had nothing to cover themselves with, every thing
being burnt. Kalasha stood on the terrace of his palace,
and saw the flames rising to the sky, and danced with
joy. The old king sceing every thing destroyed, crossed
the river, but was drowned with his wife in the sea of
grief. The queen found in the morning a dinga unburnt
which was made of jewels and which she sold for seventy
lacs to the Taka. With this monoy she bonght food
and clothes for the sorvants,aud repaired the burnt house.
The king found so vast a quantity of gold, &e., from
the embers, that ils nuration astonishes one even to this
day. When the pluce was reiluced to wilderness, the
king lived there by Inulling buts of the barks of Nada.

and Thakkana,—usittg the following harsh language,—
duch, ag he had never used before :—‘' Mave I not lost
glory, fame, heroism, kingdom, spirit, senso and wealth
by being swhjected to the influence of a wife? They say
that woman is useless appendage to man; but in his last
days man becomes a plaything for woman. Who hag
excited the jealousy of a woman but hag fallen a victim
to it? Some women have robbed their bnsbands of
beauty, sore of their strength, some their intellect, and
xoing their life. .A4 rivors iu the rainy season bring rocks
from the hilly, aven so Women, in the pride of youth, fill
the earth with sons not begotten by their husbands.
And when they seo their huibands old, they disregard
them, and lovo their children. T have known my wifs’s
faults, but in order to avoil quarrel, did not mind them
much. Aud now having marred my worldly happiness,
she attempts to rob the joys of my future life. Tam
old aud near my death; where should I go, leaving
Vijayakshetra ? Why should I disturb with anxious
thoughts, my devotion to Mahadeva who cau cancel
sins? A son is the savior of his father both in this, and
in the future world ; but who has a son like this of
mine? He would drive me from this shrine, and wish me
dic in an uuholy place. I now fully believe the rumour
that Kalasha is not born of me. When the son is
different from his father in form and character, and
quarrels‘with Kinsmen, and loves not his father, know
him to be illegitimate.” Thus the long suffering king re-

lieved his mind, and by expressing his thoughts inflicted
a, scrious wound on the feelings of his wife. Tor there
is the tradition that when the queen hnd lost her
child she had brought the child of one named Prashasta.
The queen became very much ashamed when the sccret
about her son's illegitimacy was revealed before her
relatives, and lika a vulyar woman, thus abused- her
husband. For when a woman who has subdued her
husband, is rudely spoken to by him, sho feels
agif she had bean kicked on tho lewd. “This poor
wretched mau docs not know lo suit his words to tho
place where he speaks them. At ona time ho had
no cloth to wenr after his bath, so the peoplo can

wife too has forsaken you.” The king was very much
hurt when thus abused, but sat mute and enlm; but
the blood was seen issuing out below his seat, When
the queen was anxionsly hurrying about to know whence
the blood issued, Thakkana saw that the king’ in
anger bad impaled himself with his own sword. The king
felt ashamed, ond told him to report that he had dy-

father feared his rich son and cent messenger to him ;
he treated fur peace, and invited lim. The proud son
was at list persuaded by the solicitations of the messen-
gers repeatedly sent to hit, to reluctantly make peace
with his father, The futher was to protect the person
aud proporty of the sun, and tho sun to pay a certain
ataount to the father every day. When Kalasha entered
Vijayeshvara to reecive Harsha, his eyes ached to sea

His kingdom was always gladdoned by marriages, feasta,

The king devised rules so that those who succeeded him |
might govern the kingdom without superintendents even
in the time of festivities, In the meantime, Thakkana
and two others, sons of Tanvangga with their servanta
Malia and others, sons of Gunggu, returned from foreign
country (the banks of the Ganges whither they had gone
with the bones of the lute king,) and the king satisfied
them with money. Malla lost his brother in the expe-
dition. °

Though the king had attained his maturity, still he
suffered himaclf to be advised by evil men, and did evil
things. One named Vulliya, the Takka, bronght him
girls of different tribes and nationolities from Turushka.
The king thus increased the number of his women in
his houge to seventy-two. Though excessively ad-
dicted to womeu, he kept up his vigour by taking fish-
soup, &c. On days of religious festivities he used to
ent the offerings paid to gods. Possessed of qualities,
both good and bad, he did not renew the stone temple
of Mah4deva at Vijayakshetra after it had beem burnt,
but raised a high golden umbrella to the god. At Tri-

he left his army there, andereturned to Késhmira. The .
king of Kaéshmira was very much pleased with him as
he had managed to keep Raéjapuri under control. Vijja
and others conducted themselves in a kingly style.

At this time JayZnaiida was suddenly earried off by
a mortal disense. During his illness the king came to
his houso to enquire about his health. In the course of
a conversation he told the king that he had something
very private to say to the king. Whon the other people
had gone out, he still remained silent, when Vijja, who
was still there, carne out on protence of throwing off the
remnant of the betel ho was chewing. ‘The king trusted
Vijja and asked him as to what he had to do outside,
still the sensible Vijja loitered there. Jaydnanda then
told the king what Vijja had done at Rajapuri, and
warned him that Vijja’s prosperity would be the ruin of
his kingdom. He also showed the king how Vijja, had,
through his pay, and by his other gains, became very
rich. The king became suspicious towards Vijja, aud
when he returned to his palace, Vijja perceived his in-
tentions, aud asked Ieave to depart. The king out of
politeness at first denied the permission, but on his
urgent solicitation, gladly allowed him to go. «Having
-reached his house he sent his brothera with all his
furniture out of K4shmira, and again went to the king
to bid him adieu. The king and Vijja whose minds
wero naturally estranged from each other fox political
reasons, both behaved in a strange manner. The king

did not prevent his,servart’s departure, nor did the
avrvant reproach his king in anger. The king accom-
panied Vijja a few steps, and smiled and talked on
ordinary topics, aud then went away. As Haladhara at
the time of his death had accifsed Jindurdja, even sv
Jayduanda ousted Vijja frum his post. The king did not
listen tu the advice of his ministers to soothe Vijja’s auger
hy money. The people fullowed Vijja believing that the
hing would surely recall him. ‘The kiug feared au
attack from this powerful tunn aud did uot sleep for five
tights aud startetl even at the waving of a grass. When
Sopp haved pasicd Shirapurn, the people whe fullowed him
retutned, and the king's fear was allayed; and he told
his inimeters of the apprehension he had felt. Hearing
this, they advised him to sieve on Viyyvs wealth, but the
king did not follow the advice; and they knew that the
king wes politic. Vijja did out create any disturbance vn
his way, aud was everywhere honored. Thoagh he had
wttamed power yeb Le was ever true to his king and
revered Lim a3 a gad.

Thus causing Vijja and others to be exiled Jaya-
nuuda gained much wealth, but soon died through
the cume uf Stiyyamath™ By the same curse and at the
same time died Jindurdja who had quarrelled with the,

Ganda. Vijja died of a sudden disease, and his younger
brothers suffered long imprisonment. When they ot
last fied from the prison, Péjaka was killed by a tiger
aud his younger brothers died after undergoing much
suffering. Madana, &¢., two or threa other persons who
had caused disagreement between the futher aud the son
Gid not die, but became troublesome soon after.

Vamansa who was a protigec of Jayananda now took
care of his children and was madp prime minister by
the king. The works of this wise man are still
spoken of in society by wise aud old men. The avari-
civus king took back the villages which belonged to god
Avantisvami, and built a treasury named Knlashagenyja.
He was anxious to keep his people sufe and feared Nous
kes’ cruelty, and therefure did not give him even a
fuurth portion of the gain caused by him, (by electro-
plating ?), Prasbastakalashe and other sous of It4jakalasha
then became his favorite ministers, and by their advice
the king brought back disobedient and wayward suns
and thieves to houest work and occupation.

Madanapéla again attacked Réjaputi, and the king of
Késhmira sent his general Vapyata for the help of the
city. Madsnapéle was defeated;captured and brdught to

Kandarpa, Varaéhadeva’s brother, was now made lord
of Dvdra, This person had learnt politics and war from
Jindurdja. He destroyed many Démaras, conquered
Réjapuri and cvther places aud was obeyed by many inufe-

riot chiefs. Ho way quick tempered and frequoutly
xesigned his post, but was soothed and induced by the
king to accept it again. Madana was made the lord of
Kampana. He destroyed Vopa and many other powerful
Damaras. The king was pleasél with the services of
Vijayasinha who had destroyed many thieves, and kept
hawks, made him the Police Superintendcnt of the cupi-
tual.” At the time when Kandarpa, Udayasinba and
others went to Lohara, the king kept Bhuvanaraja aloof.
He married Dhuvauamati, daughter of Kicttiraja, king
of Nilupura, nuntd malg peaco with him. He induced
Malla, son of Chingyr to acuept the post of lord of Dvara,
taking back the place fiom Vijiyasinha and his party,
Malla toade his power felt by kings, and showed his valor
at Uras4 country. With fifty horseraen he defeated the
uumerous cavalry of king Abhaya, aud conquered his
kingdom.

Iu the year 63 of the Kaéshnirian era,*eight kings
caine to the king uf Kaéshmira and entered the capital,
namely, Rirtti, king of Nyarvyepura, (Nilapura 2) Agata,
king of Champa, Kalasha son of Tukka, king of Vallapura,
Sangrémapéla,king of Réjapuri, Utkarsha,king of Lohara,
Mungyaja, king of *Urvasha, Géimbhfrastha, king of
Kanda, and Uttamaréja king of Késhthavéta, The
streets of the capital were crowded so that they could
hardly be seen. They were comfortably lodged there
when the waters of the Vitasta were frozen. Whatever
these kings thought within themselves, was known to

212 KINGS OF KASHuIRA,

tuinister Vamana, This minister, was very wise, aud
did whatever was required, without haste, as if it were
an ordinary every-day work.

When these kings returned to their kingdoms, Maila
refused to hold bis post ‘any longer, and the king asked
Kandarpa to accept it again. This proud minister at-
tacked and got possession, by stratagem, of the strong
fortress of Svdpika. When he appeared in the capital
he refused, although requested by the king, to accopt the
post, being grieved for some reason or other. Prashasta-
kalasha, who was cmpluyed as myessengor fron the king
to induce him tu accept the post of lord’ of Dvara, was
uffended ot Kandarpa’s haughty words, and collected some
armed men and placed his brother Ratuakalasha in the
post. But the new man had become popular by meaus
of his gold and was not equal to Kandarpa. Can a praint-
ed lion equal a reol lion? The king, however, yave
Kandarpa the post of the Pulice Superintendent of the
capital. But be felt pity at the abject condition to
which he reduced the thieves, and therefore threw up his
appointment and retired in sorrow to the bauks of the
Ganges. At the time of his departure the king caught
hold of his garment (wishing to prevent his goin) tut
he furvibly threw away the king’s band and wont away
in suger, He was brought back to the king, who, though
much grieved, wished ouly to destroy his pride, not his
hfe. The wise king who knew the hearts of his servants
thus suffered the rise and fall of his principal men,

This king was excessively ‘fond of songs and patronized
dancing girls, many of whom he brought from uther
countries, Near Jayavana he built a town after his
name with large houses sll contiguous to each other.
He also built there rows of temples, villages of Bréhma-
nas, palaces ond large houses and gardens with tanks in
them.

At this time the king’s son Harsha rose to reputation
on aeegunt of his uncommon talents. Ie knew the
tongnes of different countries, aud was a poet in all
languages, He knew yall sciences and his fame had
apreal to foreign countries. ‘This prince paid salaries to
the learned and to powerful men who came from various
fureign countries, and whom his frugal father refused to
entertain. Tho pay whieh he rereived frum his father
was insuilicient to meet his charity and expenses, and so
he tovk his food every other day. He used tu sing tu
his father like other singers, and with the reward he
received he’ used tu feed thuse worthy of his charity.

Une day, when he was ainying to the king, and the
court Was pleased with his sung, the king went out to
the bath-roum. Augry and grieved at this interruption
and dhsult, Harsha bent his head towards the ground,
If a master be unforgiving, or friends prove faithless ; if
a wife speaks harshly, or a sou becomes proud or servants
reply insulently, the pain and insult, though great, may

vatva told Marsha as in jdst that he might destroy his
father and reign in his place. The prince in anger
rebuked him, but Dhammata who sot there snid smiling
that the fellow had said nothing wrong. The ambitious
courtiers showed their ‘affection to the prince, as the
amorous prostitutes show their affection to their para-
mours, When the king re-antered the court, he gave
reward to his son, and pleased him with kind words,”

On another day, when the prince had retired to his
chamber after dining with his father, Vishvavatva told him
the same thing privately. ‘lhe prince replied that what
his father did was right, and forbade him fo continue the
tupie longer, but when the man still urged the same
point, the prince in anger gave him a push. But finding
that the blow had by chance hurt his nose which was
blecding, the nobly-deseended prince took pity on the
man and caused the blood to be washed by his servants,
He told thé jester that if he again spoke on that subject,
he would have the same punishment, and smiled and
gave hima cloth. The man, on account of this gift,
thought that the innocent prince favored his proposal
ag a wicked man thinks that a woman will favor him if
she but smiles. . "s
. After much endeavour and the lapse of a long period,
the prince wag induced to do the deed. Entertaining
this sinful idea he once invited his father, aud engaged
Tikehyas to murder bim, Gut when the king came, the
taurderers felt affection for him and did uot strike him,

nor did the son betray his purpose, And to prevent the
ggcret from being divulged the Tikshnas were taken into
confidence. But Vishvavatva himself disclosed to the
king the intention of the prince. Harsha came to know of
this, and thongh repeatedly asked by the king’s servants,
he did not go tu the king te dine with him that day.
His absence confirmed the suspicion of his guilt, and in
evie? the king aud his family did not dine on that day.
When in tho morning Thakkaua aud his brother came,
the hing expressed hig grief and wept long, placing his
het ou the itp of Thakkona, Ifo also spuke about
Dhatmmata and hinted that Diamimata should be bonnd
aut brought to him, They expressed their inability to
dy so and pleaded for their brother. By your favor”
they said, “wo relieve thuse who are in trouble, we keep
our duors open at night for those in distress. Whether
me younger brother be guilty or not; how can we desert
him when he cumes for help for his lif. If we protect
him. we will be accused of rebellion, so we have no other
resource left than to leave the country.” Thus saying
they towed to the king, and the king reluctantly granted
them leave to yo. Fearing au attack on the way they
went out of the countyy with their servants and furce
and troops. .

When the sons of Tanvanggn were gone, the king called
his son to him when no one else was in the room, and
svothed, him aud spoke thus :—‘ Since the creation, the
son is everywhere known by the fume of the father, but


--- Page 225 ---
216 KINGS OF KASHMIRA,

I am known to all owing to your far-famed merits.
Meritorious, and of pure reputation as you are, why do
you take to wicked ways? ‘You should not be angry
with me without hearing the reason why I am not giving
you your grandfather's riches and your own. The king
without wealth is slighted Loth by his own men and
strangers, and henee I keep your wealth. After the
construction of the city is completed, I shall fesign
the kingdom to you and shall retire either to Varanas{
(Reuaras) or to Nandikshetra. You will very soon
be master of the kingdom and the wealth. Why then
without understanding my purpose db yon act like
the wicked? TI do not believe what wicked men have
anid of you, so speak the truth and acquit yourself
of the alloged guilt.” The king out of his affec-
tion wished that tha prince might deny his guilt
and prove himsclf innocent, and therefure made the
enqniry. “He was willing to pardon his son and wished
to prove the innucence of his son to the people even
by a falsehood. Harsha praised the speech of his
father and went out saying that he would speak the
truth through some faithful person. To the persan
sent by his father, the prince’-said that through the
wadvice of wicked men he had really intended to rebel,
and fled in fear to his own house. When the messen-
ger returned to the kiug, the king saw the miserable
countenance of the man and struck his head with his
hand and exclaimed *O my son!”

KINGS OF KASnMERA. 217

The king then cwtsed Tursha to be attacked, but
the soldiers, hearing that he would strike off his own
head if his sun was killed, only surrounded the palace of
Harsha, The ‘Tikshuas (prineg’s followers) closed the
vate and surrounded the prince,” and, feeling their death
unavoidable, thus spoke rudely to their master, “O!
wicked, careless and hateful mun, where can you linpa to
live after destroying us by intrigue? You kuow that
your father will save your life, aud he knovs this
you will save his hf, but we mity shall ba killed,
Vivht, being in our inikst, or we will Mill you,—in either
mye you die” ‘The hing heard of this and became very
apprehensive for lag aou’s safety. Now Dandalra, a very
respectable man whe was with the king, came tu Harsha,
The ‘Tikshnas admitted him takiug him for a partisan
of the prince. Dandaka cume ta the prince and address-
ed him, after bewitching those around, “O! prince,
though you live along Tift, still the elements which

And since death is sure and nigh, perform that for which

shall lead, and whatever muy betide, be it victory er
defeat, you will be decked with glory. Rise and shave,
and speedily dress as befits a warriur.” Revered by the
Pikshnas, he induced the prince and the barber to gaint»

alond to the king’s soldiers that he had placed the prines
in safety, and bade them now do their duty. Diseases
are removed by medicines, the body is protected from
swords by mail, and the fears of kings are averted by
wise men. Tho king’s soldiers, intending to enter the
prince’s place with eries, tried to scale the wail. | The
Tfleshnas left the prince in the room, the dvors of which
were strong, and rushed out. Two-or three fell there,
aud the rest of the prowl band issued ont without
attempting to oppose the assailaxts. They then went to
the temple of Sadashiva, passing that of Suryyamatignn-
risha and killing those who opposed thom. Though the
king ordered his men not to kill his kinsmen, still Sahaja,
his relative, perished in the afftay, and Tivya, a learned
Brébmenn and warrior, was killed by the enemy. So also ,
died Rémadeva and Keshi, the latter boing a native of
Karndta. Some who deserted their arms and attempted
to kill their own partisnns were captured and killed as
cowards deserve. On the sixth bright lunar day in the
month of Pousha in the year sixty-four of the K4shmi-
vinn era, this fight between the father and the son
caused by the courtiers took plate. Thus, for His com-
pauionship with wicked men, the prince was humbled
and imprisoned. The queen, Bhuvanamati, waa nt first
requested to make peace between the father and the
son; but when the latter was imprisoned, the proud queen
committed suicite by cutting her throat.

saw that every one was agaitist hiny, and considered each
day that he lived as so much gained, nor trusted that he
would be alive much longer.

The king began to commit unheard of crimes, such
as foretold his sudden’ death. Virst he uprooted the
copper image of the Sun, and then took it away
from the temple. Wishing to obtain the proper-
tics of those who died without leaving any children, the
evuel king descended to mean actions. , The curses of the
people and his excessive fondness for women brought on
gonorrhaa, The kivg now thought of performing certain
ceremonies (Kumbhapratishtha) in the temple of Hara
hen the king’s nose began to bleed,—all attempts to
eure it failed or rather increased the disease. Much
bleeding reduced him and he was obliged to tuke to
bed. He had indigestion, and lost his strength and
flesh, We was anzions to give his kingdomn to Harsha,
but seeing his miuisters averse to it, he brought Utkarshn
from the hills of Luhara, Ou his death-led he distri-
buted riches to all, high and low, but not to the femaley

bring Harsha that he might give him riches and send
him out of the kingdom. The ministers sent awaly the
xeynl guards who kept watch on Unrsha and placed the
Thakkuras of Lultara in their place, and then informed
Wrkarsha of all that hal happened. They then took
Harsha ont to the dascing house, and tied |im,: bereft

other hand the king,*on the point of his death, told hig
men to take him to ashrine, Remembering that his
disease was the result of his uprooting Témrasvémi he
wished to take refuge at Martonda. Urged by fear
the king went to that shrine leaving that of Vijaya-
kshetra. At the time of death the wise and the
fouljsh alike act like children, This action of the king
showed his weakness, and the good instructions he had
received became objects of laughter. On the third bright
lunar day in the month of Agrabayana at night fall
the king set out in awarriage drawn by a pair towards
the templo of the Sun. The sounds of the dram, &e.,
drowned that of the lamentations of the people. He
then went by river in ws hoat with his ministers and
ladies. Next day, at about evening, he reached the
temple of the Sun, and there, in the hope of life, he
caused a gelden imaye to be made. Tis pain was further
aggravated by hiy anxiety to see his eldest son Iarsha,
but still “his servants disobeyed him, and would
not bring Harsha before the dying’king. The king
sighed, and opening the duors of his room heard
the sougs which the singers sang outside, and which
were Composed by Hatsha, When a king’s order at the
time of his death is not attended to, it gives greater
pain than death ituelf. He instructed Utkarsha to
divide (tho kingdom) with his brother Horsha, and his
tongue-lost the power of speech. He only muttered
repeatedly the name of Harsha, and to understand his

intentions the minister, Nonaka, brought a looking glass.
The king smiled and shook his head refusing the mirrury
and bit his lips and muttered something ; and after a
day and a half, he entiroly lost his power of speech. At
the moment of his death he signed to his ministers to
approach him, and caused himself to be taken, by those
who were not overwhelmed with grief, befure the ‘image
of the Sun. At the age of forty-nine on the sixth bright
lunar day in the month of Agrabdyana in the year sixty-
five of the Kashmirian era he died. Mammanikaé and six
others of his queens died iu his funeral, ns also a conen-
bine named Joyamati. Kayyaé, another of his mistresses
whom be had enriched with his favor, was the disgrace of
her sex. She forgot that she was the principal of the
late king's mistresses, and had been burn of low caste,
and the position of her lover, It grieves ng that she
went to Vijayakshetra and took into her faver the
officers of the place. Fie to the woman whu was unce
beloved of the king, but brought herself down to be
au object of enjoyment of the villagers. All the
sninisters were anxious to coronate Utkarsha, only the
grateful minister Vamana performed the funeral rites of
the late king. On one side arose the music and songs
of coronation, and on the other the lamentation for the
dead and funeral music.

A difference now arvse between the new king and Vija-
yamalls, son of the late king by queen Padmaslrf. The
king promised to pay him every day the same amount

and his attaiument of the kingdom was near nt hand,
When his brother sent him a man to attend to his meal,
he sent the man back asking to be released, and. to be

he asked that his dues might be paid. If neither
of these were dono he threatencd he would commit
suicide by refraining from foods The king induced him
to take his food by falsely promising him his due,
Harsha asked for his due every day and every day tho
king deferred payment till the next day. Thus the king
gained time, but his conduct aroused suspicion in the
roind of the imprisoned prince. Harsha one day beat
his servant Praydga to avert all suspicion regardiuy
the step he was going to take, and then privately sent
him to Vijayamalla, infurming him how he had been
imposed upon by the king, Proyégo complained to
Vijayamalla, the younger brother of Harsha, that his
elder pined in confinement while he was in the kingdom.
Vijayamallo’s heart was touched’ with grief, and after
"thinking foralong time he expressed his doubt as to
whether the king would hear him, but added that he
would try his best to have him released. In the mean
time he urged on Harsha to take care to-preserve his

Vijayamalla marched back towards che enpital enrly next ,
morning. Some of the Daimaras heard of his retum
,and knew his purpose and joined him. Vijayamalla
then made Madhuravatta, who was one of the mediators,
the head of his cavalry. Naga, who belonged to the
party of Vijayamalla, but whe had not left that of the
king, hastened to the king with a few horsemen by way
of Padmupura, but was delayed by some accident on
the road, Vijaynmalia, on the other‘hand, hastened to-
wards the capital and, encouraged by a signal of a light
on the tup of a Shala tree, surrounded the eapilal and
burnt the houses, Jayaraja, too, whom the king had
disappointed, after making a promise, espoused the
eutse of Vijayamalla. These two princes vow began ty
eunsider ag to what they should do of the king. Vijaya-
walla sent messnge to the king to intimate that he
would retire when Harshaduva waa released, and at the

‘the prisun was deserted by the guards, Harsha sent the
Thakkuras tu the army of Vijayatalle; and afraid of
having made the king’s enemies his friends, he advised
them to deliver the following massave ; “The witked mau
id wow in trowhle, so release me soon or the king will
ay me.” Whe he hod thas instructed the Thakkuras,

KINGS OF KASUMIIA, 227
aud they were debibernting as to what to do, he
hewd the sound as if some body kicking against the
door from outside. Have they deceived me,” said Harsha.
“Open the door, O! Thakkuyas.” But the Thakkuras
were panie-struck, and so he controlled his fears and
spened the door himself. Sixteen armed men of
Lohara entered the room to murder him. Nonaka had
repeatedly told the king that the tumult would cease in
ao ioment if Hargha wg beheaded; and the king had
acted on his advice aul had sent these murderers. Tmme-
diately after thi king changed his mind aud thought
thatof Harshias tifa was spied now, he might be of
soe servico hereafter. We therefore eancelled his
former order and directed his men fo keep Harsha
safe from the Thakkuras. Te instructed them, however,
that they were to kill Harsha if he sent them a parti-
cular ring, but that on the coutrary they were to release
him if he sent them a certain other ring. Then he
showed them the two rings which were on his fingers,
and told them to nwait his future command. The
tnurderers accordingly entered the room, but did not
kill Harsha on the spot. Harsha called every one of
them Ly name, gave théim betels and made them sit down
before him, hua received, the men took the betel»

tention to murder him. The man who possesses an

dressed them and said, “ Why are you ashamed}
Servants who obey the orders of their master are uot
to blame. Wait here for a little while and you will ,
sea very strange things, and will obseryo how the
condition of man changes every moment, As clouds

gular changes in Nature with the progress of time; in
the same way, do you watch the changes in man. Ieat
increnses just before the rain, and darkness thickeus
just before dawn. Iu the same way, kings doomed to
death may yet gat kingdoms, for, ay in Nuturo, excessive
suffering may lead to good furtune.” Feeling sure of
future grentness, by the good omen of his life being
spared, Harsha narrated instances of good men who
had attained happiness after undergoing sufferings
like him. Tu while awny the tima he related to them
the pure and Jucid story of Harishchoudra. They
fid not know that all the time that Harsha was so
entertaining them, he was envaged in getting tuforma-
* tion as to how matters stood outside. Utkarsha thought
of many plana regarding Horsha, but at last thought
it expedient to kill him, and repentedly sent messengers
to that effect. But he furgot to send the ring, so that
the murderers did not obey the messages, Finding his

Kings oF Kisnuina. 299

orders repeatedly disregarded, the king recollected all
abont the rings and sent Shira, a Rajpoot of noble
qualities, giving him, however, the wrong one through
mistake. Thus king Utkarsha, through oue act of for-
gotfulnes; and one inistake, had to lose his life, The
murderers, too, had been gained over to Harsha’s favor
by his politene.s; and when Shira came they believed
that “he had brought the fatal ring. They wanted to
kill Shira for thi,;—but when the doors were opened

joy as thoy approvehad the prince, taking Shiira

On tha other hand Vijryarmalla thought that Harsha
was dead, and was very angry and vigorously maintain-
i his opposition. He intended to burn the capital, and
was with «ifficnlty deterred from so doing by the king's
men, who aswred him that Harsha was living. And to
make hun believe their statement, they sent to him
Sugald, TWarshws wife, clal agalady should when her
husband is alive. Vityanoalla saw her, and gave up
his intention to burn the city. The king now thought-
that the tumult would ceaso if Harsha was releised.
Nonaka, Prashast«kalasha aud others went and released
Harsha, aul reluctintly relinquished their intention of
destruying him, ‘The citizens showered flowers on

Harsha as he rode on horse with tho ministers to the .
king in the place of battle. When he arriyed there the
king congratulated him, and told him to go and tell hiy
brother to stop hostilitios, and after his return thence he
would settle Harsha’s claims at his leisure. Harsha
consented to do so and went out. The king with his
ministers entered the treasury, leaving the field of hattle,

When Vijayamalla saw Harsha, now safely delivered
from the dangers he was in, he was for a time motionless
with joy. And after salutations and, embraces they
began a long conversation. Thoss who stood by exprossed
their wish that Tavrahe wonld kill Utkarsha and be
king, Vijayamalla did not approve of this proposal, on
which Hursha was surprised. He saved himself by
riding to and fro, his person being the object of conten-
tion between the two brothers, Utkarsha and Vijaya-
malla, As the tree which is saved froin forest fire by
vein fears the thunder-bolt, ax one after esonping the
alligator runs the risk of death by drowning, even so
man is saved from one danger and thrown into another
by Fate, so that the happiness that succeeds may be
alithe more relished. Some of Harsha’s foot-soldiers
discovered that their master was saving himselfon'pre-

‘tence of riding and joined him.

Harsha consulted Vijayamalla for atime, and then
went to the king to say that the hostilities had ceased.
But when he was entering the palace where the king
was ho was forbidden to do so by Vijayasinha, “ After

esenping death,” he cnquirtd, “why aro you again en-
tering there to die,O! You of little sense? Relinquish
your fuur, and go and take your seat on the throne.”
The servants brought the throne from the treasury,
and Ifarsha hastily sat on it. Segala, bis wife, who had
formerly exerted so much against hitn, now took her
sent by his side ; and the ministers came to his covena-
tion. > Heating of this, the wily Vijayasinha drew out
Utkusha from his charaber and placed him in another
room, ‘The Into king was now taken, with but few atten-
dants, to the sew king. Prosperity Insts nob for

Vijayamalla heard that Harsha, his elder brother, had
become king, and went tu him and was well received by
Harsha’s men and taken to his (Vijsyamalle’s) louse.
When the king’s artay came near, he caused Vijayamalia
to be brought to him and styled him his deliverer, say-
ing that,—“ yuu have given me my life and kingdom ;”
aud clasped his hands befure him. Thus favored by tha
gods and by his own jwlisions management, Harsha
became king. He sat on the throne with the very
clothes that he bad when in prison. And when weary
with the toil, he retired to bis bed at night leaving all
cares aside, ‘He could not slecp, though he lay with his

eyes shut, for he fancied he heard the sound of
slaughter. ;

Utkarsha, now a prisoner, asked of his ministers for
advice, Nonaka rebuked him and spoke to him harshly og
follows :—* You did not listen to the advice I gave you
in the morning: now attend te my words, and I shal) tell
you what will befall you for your injudicions acts, You
insulted Harsha when he was imprisoned, tomorrow he
will deliver you to the hands of the executioners. ‘There
ia no respite but in death; but even death is hard to
altain, now that the war is oyer. It'is not proper to
yobuko a person in time of distress. You always thought
of present happiness, aud not of possible adversity, and
therefore in a moment you have lost all. Aso smolt
hole in a worn out cloth becomes larger the more
‘you attempt to sew it up, even so a bad action, when
strengthened and supported by bad means, becomes a
hundred times worse.” When Utkarsha heard this, he
retired from the presence of the ministers into another
janer chamber with one of his mistresses, named Sahoajé.
Ho pretended to be going to repeat the Sandhyé
prayers ; but there he hid himself in the dark, and in the
excess of his grief he cut the arteries of his throat with
ra, cloth-cutting knife, Sahajé heard the sound made
by the knife, and saw with terror the stream of blood
flowing out of the screen. She then saw his head hang-
ing, and thick blood issuing out of the wound. Her
subsequent conduct is edifying to wives who love

their husbands, Nfght goes away leaving the moon
behind her, but when the sun sets, evening follows bim.
The conduct of women, too, in the same way, is some-
times blameable and some times praiseworthy. Though
Kayy& and Sahaj& were both heloved of their husband,
yet every one praised the latter and spoke ill of the former.
Sahojé was a dancing girl in a temple: the late king saw
har once in a dancing hall and made her his mistress.
She purified her loys by porishing in fire. When she was
a prostitute, she was also beloved of Harsha, and though
Harsha now agked her*to live with him, she did not
turn away from death. Utkarsha died when he was
a little younger than twenty-four years of aye, and after
reigning for twenty-two days. His corpso lay for one
night and was burnt on the morning. Some of bis mis-
tresses who were then among the hills of Lahara also
perished by fire, .

Harsha’s party now disarmed the late king's ministers,
but Nonaka resolved to die and did not give up his
arms, Prashastekalnsha, however, induced him to lay
down his arms, telling him that the king must release
them in time, as otherwise there is no one to be his
ministers. Consequently it was not wise to sacrifice hia
life. The king then had Nonaka alias Nona, Sibléra-~
bhatta, Prashastakalasha, &c., bonud, and sent them
to prison. Thus in one day Harsha created a revolution
ag if it bad heen achieved by the yoda,

234 KINGS oF KAstuMina.

The reiens of other kings’ have,,been narrated; but
ib is difficult to narrate the present one. Here I shall
relate king Harshe’s character. He was fall of energy ;
but possessed traits of character inconsistent with
each other. He devised various laws, but also subverted
all rules, His power was felt on all sides, and yet was
frequently disobeyed. Ie was very charitable, but
at the samo time plundered many people. He was very
kind, but caused many murders. He did mony good
as woll as sinful acts. He was both loved and hated,
was both good and bad, and was admired and
spoken ill of Surely he was made cf atoms of fire,
for even ot the time of his birth great men could
not look at him. His prowess was not equalled either
among men or gods, it might among Dénavns, Tis
eatrings were bright as suns, and he wore a crown
aud a turban. IJlis look was like that ofalion, Ie
wore beafd, and his shuulders were like those of o bull,
Tie had long arms, and was of a somewhat dark com-
plezion, His body was of proper proportions. His chest
was broad, and his waist was narrow, and his voice deep
as that of clonds. In form he could shame even super-
human beings. He hung four large bells at the four

- lion-gates that he might know by their sound when any
one wos coming to speak to him. He heard the com-
plaints of the grieved, and relieved their misery. In the
palace there was none meagerly clad, or clad in unweought
cloth, or without gold oxnaments. Nunicrous people


--- Page 244 ---
RINGS OF KAsiufRA. 935

gathered at the lion-gntes,*and it appeared as if the
wealth of various countries was collected there. The
humerous ministers and guards walked in the palace
adorned with gold ornaments. Thus reigned the new
king, and implicitly followed-the advice of Vijaya-
malla.

The court was filled with Vijayamalla’s men, whose
advise the king followed ont of gratitude; and dis.
regarding his own men he gave posts to his father’s minis-
ters. Kandarpa was placed at Dvadra, Madama at
Kampana, aud Wijayasinha, &o., in their respective posts,
When his anger abated, he released Prashastakalasha
and others and gave them their own posts, Bue recol-
lecting the many evil acts duue by Nonaka, aud being
angry with him, Harsha impaled him with his half brother
(son of his nurse.) Sub-equently, however, when he
found himself in difficulties he remembered Nonaka, the
wise and faithfal to his master, and repented of lis decd,
A worthy mau, though he does us injury, is sometimes of
service tu us. Nonaka was impaled by Vishabbatta and
other Rajpoots, but not before he had seen his wife
mutilated, her ears and nose being cut off. The kine
bestowed weulth on pis servants who had shared his
captivity, Sunna, son of Vajra, was made prime minis,
ter, and when the king was out, the people generally
migtook his minister for the king. This Sanna had
a younger brother, named Ydayaraja, who was made chief
of his attendsuts, anc was loved by the king more dearly

than even his lif. Dhammata,* wno for his tenderness
for his two brothers had gone to the banks of the Ganges
now returned with his nephews to Kashmira, The king,
for whom Dhammata had lost his elder brother, now
honored him end his nephews and looked on him ag
his own self.

Thus when the king and Vijayamalla were administer.
ing the kingdom the latter, instigated by wicked
men, changed his mind and wanted to rebel. Why
give the kingdom to another after conquering
it? Thus advised by the vicked, “he wished to
usurp the kingdom, and began to plan the death
of his elder brother. Intending to kill him in a
solitary room, he invited Harsha to a religious feast
which he instituted. The king knew his purpose, and
fearing an attack ordered his army to be collected. In the
meantime, when the army was being ready, Vijayamalis
stole horses from the royal stable and attempted to get
away from the city with the horses forcitig his way
through the king's army. In his flight he fought with
superhuman bravery with the royal army, seated on
his horse with his wife. Untimely rains, which fell
everywhere, bewildered the people about this time.
The contest was hot, and priuce Vijayamalla was
covered with arrows. The sons of Chandaka (Chan-
dalas) pursued him with a determination to kill

*See pages 214--5. This person was implicated in Harsha's
rebellion against his jather,

KINGS OF KASHMTRA. 237

him, and his army, becamo reduced. He came to
the spot where the Vitasté and the Sindhu met, and
the bridge over it being broken by the force of the
waves, ha first enused tha horses to descend into the
water, and then swam over to the other side with his
wife. Thus he came out safely with his wife in the face
of his enemy, and his horse followed him across tho river,
Whoil the enemies were out of sight, he rode on his horse
and went towards Darat by the road leading to Lahara,
Kandarpa, lord of Dvara, had secured all the passes
aginst Vijnyamdlla; bug the latter sculed the mountains
aud reached ths city of Darat encircled by mountains,
There Vidyédhara welcomed him, and some of Vijaya-
malla’s men joined their master. On the other hand,
Harsha learnt that the Damaras were willing to fight for
Vijayamalla and began to devise plans, but which did
not sucoeed. Vijayamalla passed the winter at Darat,
and having secured the Damaras in his cause, marched
out in pride from his retreat in the mouth of Chaitra,
He hat now overcome all difficulties, and was encamping
on the rond, when he died by the fall of snow.
Fate mars the effurts of the great by insignificant means !

Haisha was now rélieved of his fears. He was the
most powerful king of his time and neighbuurhood. He.
introduced many elegant customs in his kingdom, Pre-
vious to his time uo one except the king tied his hair
or wore, a turban or ornaments. No distinction was
allowed in the kingdom, in so much that Madana, lord of


--- Page 247 ---
238 kines oF KAsuMfRa.

Kampana, had incurred the king’s anger for tying his
hair, and Joy4nanda, the chief minister for wearing colored
cloth. But this king introduced fitting dresses in his
kingdom, He ordered some of his female servants to
adorn some of his ministers with good robes, He liked
the customs of the south, and introduced coins like those
current in Karndfta. His couri was fillod with men
adorned with palm leaves and broad marks of sandak and
good long swords, Women clothed themselves like mon,
and wore garlands of gold in imitation of the leaves of
Ketaka, and adorned themaelves with marks of sandal
and liues of collyrium drawn from tho eyes to tho ears,
and with the holy thread made of gold. The ends of
their garments kissed the ground, and their brenst and
arms down to the elbows were covered by boddice. Thoir
smiles were white as camphor.

Those who came to beg from the king could, by the
king’s bounty, feed others who depended on them ; as the
clouds, by their connection with the sea, can nourish
the earth with rain. By the king's liberality these who
came to sing became almost as rich as himself. He
bestowed immense gold on the learned, nud allowed them
to ride on cars drawn by pair and-{o use umbrella. In
the reign of Kelasha, one Rihlana, a learned man, went
out of Késhmira and lived in the court of Karn4ta.
There the king named Parmédi gave him the title of
Vidy4pati; oud he used to ride on elephant before the
army, oud he alone used the umbrella in jresence of

the king. But nuw He heard that the liberal Harsha was
# friend of the learncd, and repentel having gone out of
Kashinfra,

Hursha’s capital became one of the beautiful things of
the earth, adurned with gold and high buildings which
tuuched the clouds. In the pleasure-garden of the
king there were almost all sorts of trees, He ex-
eavated a large tank named Pamp4 adorned with
various birds andcvanimals. He himself was learned
in various depaptments of knowledge. Even to this
duy his songs are Tistencd, even by his enemies,
with teary im their eyes. Me used to sleep two
praharas during the day oud to keep up nights, wher,
be gayo audience to the people amd passed bis time in
enjoyment. Hespeut the night iu conversation with
the lesrned, and in songs and dancingin the court, which
was lighted with thousand Inmps. At tho close of con-
versation was only heard the noise caused by the chew-
iny of Letels or the sound produced by the dried Shefili
in the hair of the women. A cloudlike canopy hung
abyve, and the burning lamps looked like a wall of fire.
The bars of guld were like serpents, the swords looked
like ‘snioke, the feanles beamed like Apsarag, the minis-
ters were ag stars, the learned like an assembly of the ;
gods, and the sinyers like yandharvas. This place appear-
ed to.be the seat uf borh Yama and Kuvers, for Charity

of the court at night, which it is impossible to deseribe,
The king was richer than Indra. a

In his time transactions were onrried on mostly by gold
and silver coins, and very little by copper dinnars, Sunna
was the chief executive officer, and had attained to the ,
highest rank, but behaved meanly owing to his great
avarice, He deprived the mouastaries (mathas) at Ajaya-
vana, one of his estates, and at Mulaka and Vijayeshvara,
of the means of their support. In the reign of this king
the hungry, the helpless, the sick and the poor were re-
lieved of their grievances. Ona Champaka squandered
his long accumulated wealth by spendin it at Nandi-
kshetra for soven days in every year. The king enriched
the Br&hmanas, who wore deer-akina by his liberality. The
king’s wife, Vasantalekha, a daughter of the Sabi family,
built monasteries and villages for the habitation of the
Brahmonas in the capital and at Tripureshvara, She shone
as bright ss a flame, and her character was so elevated
that the like of her was never seen in the country.

The new ministers, as they grew up in power, guided
the king’s mind aguinst the former ministers, on whom
they always looked with jealousy. It is by o whim
of Fortune that great men are deceived and led- by the

“weak. Though the king was learned and well skilled in
business, yet be was misled by his wicked ministers.
In order to repay the enmity of bis father, now dead,
he caused the monasteries, &c., in the capital, called after
his father’s name, to be plundered. And having aquane

dered the boarded ereasures of his avaricious father, he
gave him the name of Payasena,

In the mean time, Buuvanardja planned to got posses-
sion of Lohara, aud seeretly collected fyot-suldiers and
stationed them ut Kota. But hearing that Kandarpa,
the lord of Dysra, was advancing to meet him, be agaia
hid himself,

Atthis time Sangrdinapdla, king of Rajapurf, found
opportunity to rivg against Kastuufra, Lut the king
bocame angry with Kandarpa, tor trying te cellect the
seattored men of Kote, aud sent Deudentyaka to Réja-
pu, He hastily went with bis army by way uf Lohara,
but luilered fora month mud a half neue the waters of
Kota, On the approach of the sturnmer months, be got
frizhtened by the power of the enemy oul felt ua
inclination to proceed in the expeditivu. On the other
hand, Kaudurpa was rebuked for lis inactivity, as he did
nothing, not knowing the king’s inelmatiun. Wheu
rebuked, he determine, although he had no military
equipments, to cunquer Rajupuri, and vowed not to take
food till ho had couquered it, He proceeded alony the
mountains, lived in muuntain caves, aud abstuined from
food, aval fuund hiasel# on the sixth day, o little beyond
one yojana of Rajapuri. He reached the place without’
mecting with opposition, aud entered the enery’s ling and
disarmed them. Of the army uf Dandundyeke, ouly une

the warriors of Réjapuf{ in the way, and they thought,
because that officer had the device of a white umbrella,
that it was Kandarpa himself whom they had killed,
At noon, however, Kandarpa, with twenty or thirty men, ,
entered the capital of Réjapurf. Bofure the gates of
this city, three hundred infantry of Kandarpa opposed
thirty thousand warriors of the enemy. In this battle
the K4shmirians lost two hundred men, and four hundred
of the Khash as perished. When the battle was over,
the place was lighted by numerous fires for performing
the last rites of the doad, and itlooked like the cooking
place of Death, Dy this act of Kandaspa tho fiendish
anger of the king was appoased in the bloody battle field,
Exosperated by tho defeat, the enemy rallied, and
came to fight again with Kandarpa in the last prohara
of the day. Kandurpa discharged iron nérécha besmeared
in a preparation of oil, which set fire on every side where
they fell.” The foolish enemies believing that Kaudarpa
knew the art of discharging firo arms, and in fear, fled
afar, Even in the midst of danger, the bravery, spirit,
presence of mind, tact and coolness never leave great
men. At sunset he entered the capital, but again saw
the streets outside the city covered with soldiers, But
- when he again came out to fight, he found that Dandané-
saka had arrived, aud seeing the carnage caused in the
Tate battle, had remuined there in fear with his army.
Some are emboldened by their own loss,—some ara
frightened at the sight of the loss of other people.

, Who can understand human nature? Kandarpa then
came out and bronght the frightened captain into the
town, as the Hangua in the fable led the crow. ‘Who can,
by his own valor, enter a foreign country like Kandarpa,
when the people there are loyal, and the army large and
united? Within one month Kandarpa returned to his
country, after exacting tribnte from the fallen king of
Rajapurf. Harsha welcomed him, and rose as he came,
so that ha became tho object of envy of Dandandyaka
and others, .

Kanduepa wat invested with a title for the goad
administration Sof Parihdsapura. Bat the king, throngh
the evil advice of his primo minister who had been
largely bribed, removed the seat from Kandarpa aud
ordered him to sit near his feet. The ministers who
wera jealous of Kandarpa, were very glad, particularly na
they thonght that some oue out of them would gain the
lordship of Dvira. By their advice the “king made
Kandarpa lord of Lohara and sent him to that pro-
vinee where a rebellion had broken cut, The mean-
minded ministers thus drove Kandarpa, the wise and
valorous, from the neighbourhood of the king. Kings
who cannot julge for themselves soon perish by
the council of the wily. As sands creep out of the
haud, so the liking of the king towarda Kandarpa gradu-
ally decreased during his, absence. The ministers now
told "the kiug that Kandarpa had token with him two
sons of Utkarsha and intended to reign at Lohara. The

244 KINGS OF KAsmutiRa,

king believed their tale, and sent Patta and Asidhara
with an army to capture and kill him. By some mistakg '
in the sending of letters, Kandarpa learnt of the arrival
of the army and its purpose ; he became astonished and
disgusted ond stunned’for the momont. Jnst at this
time Asidhara arrived. Kandarpa was then playing
at dice. Asidhara attempted to tie his hand, but Kandarpa
withdrew his hand, and he wrung the hand ef his dppo-
nent So that he retired in excess of pain. Kandarpa then
reproached himself that he had ever taken service under
such a king after serving undor king Anantadeva, He
said in sorrow to Patta that if the king would send him
his relatives, he would deliver up the fort in his posses-
Bion and dopart. When his relatives came, be did not
revolt against his king, but quietly gave up his posses-
sions and went to Benaras.

He killed a chief of Gay& and placed another in his
stead, and +hus obliged the withdrawal of the tax which
was levied on the Kishmirians who came here to perform
the Shraddha of their forefathers, THe also destroyed a
robber chief and cleared the way to the East, and made
it safe for the travellers, He destroyed a Serce tiger at
Benaras, and adorned the East with many templer. .

- Since the exile of Kandarpa, the bad ministers envied
ene another, and did much injury to the king. As fat-
tened rams, maddened with pride, strike one another with
their horns, even so the ministers quorrelled with one
another. And as thornless shrub which lie between tho

rama ig sdon torn to piecos, ¢ven so tho helpless king sul-
fered from the disputes of his ministers, Thus passed
sometime. Dhammata, son of Tanvangga, wished to get
the kingdom by rebellion, and attompted to kill the king,
The wily Dhammata induced Jayaréja, son of a prosti-
tute,* to murder the king, and sent him for that purpose,
He thought within himself that after the king’s death he
would inherit the kingdom, a3 Jayaraja was a prostitute's
son. And Jayurdja too would naturally be suspected of
the crime. They ficited tho people of the village of
Vilava to rebellion, and also won over two or throu
inmates of the king’s Rouschold, The plan sueceeded
for a while, aud the king sent Dhamioats with honors
to Lajapuri aa ambassador, But Jayardju eventually
found his plans beginning to fail and came to Dham-
mata, who was waiting in the house of “ thousand good
omens” for an auspicious day to start. When holding
a private consultation, they were overheard by a follower
of Prayaya from near the wall. He divulged everything
to Prayaga, who informed the king about it, and the king
forbade the journey of Dhammata. Afraid of the
destruction of his own kinsmen, the king refrained from
taking severe measuray; he only remained slways on
guard, Jayardja seeing his attempt fruitless, employer
Naya and P4ju, two heroic but low démaras as his spies,

Tho king heard that Jayaraja had set out with his

followers to fight with him and made preparations fur

defence: >

The wily Dhammata, om the other hand, armed him-
self on the morning, and pretending to set out for ¢
battle, led Joyorgja into a chamber to worship. J ayardjn
then, with his nephew Dhammata, entered the room and,
to his terror, found himself before the king in a room
with closed doors. Having set the guards outside the
room, Pray4gn, by the king’s order, whispered to Dham-
mata to murder Jayoraja. The king thought that as
Jayarija confided in Dhammata he would surely disarm
himself, And by ordering Dhammata to murder his
colleague, Dhammata would not think that the king had
knowledge of his guilt. And if Jayaréja resisted and fought
with Dhammata, the death of one or both of them would
bo, to the king’s advantage, and people would uot biame
or suspect the king if both of them died in the soufile,
Thus thinking the wise king determined on that step,
and Dhammata, believing that his own share of the guilt
was unknown to the king, thus spoke with insoleuce to
Jayargja: ‘' The king is displeased with thee, and if
thou art no longer a rebel, then cast aside thy arms with-
ont delay to show thy innocence.” Whether by divine
influence, or by reason of his confidence in Dhammata,
Jayardja, though expert in arms, laid down his weapons
when thus rebuked. When Tulla, son of Ajjaka and
“grandson of Tanvangga, saw the weakness of Jnyardja, he
reverely rebuked him: ‘Surely thou art not born of
Kajja by king Kalasha; your father must surely -have
been aneuter.” Tulla knew not the virtue of patience

under ndcessity, and thes$ words were like cold water
sprinkled ona aloeping man, When Jayar4ja was tortured
to confess tho plans of rebellion, he confessed his own
crimes, but did not say regarding those of Dhammata,
At night ho was tortured to death by a cord put round
his neck by Jayaka, a door-keeper. Ifis head was severed
from his body, and thrown into the waters of Bhatt4-
ranadvala, where it was eaten by fishes, In the Kash-
nifrian era 71, in the month of Bhadra, Jayarija was
murdered, and thén the king secretly planned the des-
truction of Dhagmate,

For this pyrpose (ho king sent for Thakkura named
Kalasharéja, a nian well skilled in arms, aod who wag
living at Lohara. The king received him with kindness,
anf told him that whon Prayéga would send 4 messenger
to him, he would do the work. Praysgo feared that tho
act might be left undone, and angrily told the king to
take coungil aud to do what seemed ft. ‘The king was
sitting with his five principal ministers when Vamana told
him that the deed shuald be done before the mivisterg
left the room. He said these words and there died
within the closed doors, By the kings order Praydga

mata to draw his weapon; and Dhammata ‘took up
his dagger to kill him. Kalasharaja struck him in
the front, and his sons from behind. Dhammata fol
down and died. The eldest son of Kalashardja was
wounded by the weagon of Dhammata, which was
poisoned, and sniffered from repeated sores. Unfortu-
nately for him, his sword had broken and he was ill-
armed. They threw him down from behind, art his
body was, by the king’s order, given to be caten by
dogs, The king took under his protection Rihlana
and Sahlana, grandsons of Tanvangga, as they were
unarmed. / -

Tulla and others were onraged and intended to robol,
but were kept back by the wiles of Udayasinha. “ You are
my sons,” said the virtuous Udeyasinha to them, and rely.
ing on his faith, and influenced by love of life, they laid
down their arms. “Come to the king,” said Udaya-
sinha to them, “and show that you are innocent.”
They all went by the way leading to the palace, The
ambrella-bearer of Dhammata, who was bred up in
Dhammata’s house, smiled and said to Tulla : ‘‘ Have you
forgotten, O! grandson of Tanvangga, what you said
to Jayaréja before. Your case -jssimilar to his, Why

-have you then, 0! fool, assumed patience and weakuess ?
It appears that you were born of my father, and your
heroic father gave me birth.” Thus saying he com-
mitted suicide by his sword. Pretending to lead thom
to the king, the officers shut Tulla and others up in tha

prison, The king was kind hearted and intended to
‘spare them on acconut of their youth. But at night
one wicked Vimhiya tortured them by tying a rope
round their necks in the king’s presence, Vimbiya
murdered four of theta,—Talla, Vijayaraja, Vulla and
Gulla, Tiven to this day, old mon speak of their
beauty, even after death, with tears in their eyes. Long
wag tho place of their death known by their seattercd

The two soni uf Utkarahy had now grown up, aod
the older of thefn namad Dumba was seeretly murdered
by the king, ‘The young and spirited boy Jayamalla,
son of Viynyamalla, when the king regarded as a spark
of fire, was murderet in the similar way. Thus it is
by a divine providence that while kings murder their
relatives to relieve theraselves, their kingdums are
enjoyed by strangers after their deaths. Dees are killed
providentially by the waving of the Asvattha (peepul)
leaves near the hechive in order that some stranger
Tay obtain the honey with ease, The great crime of
tourdering his own relatives spoilt the soundness of the
king’s judyment, so that even children were murdered
by his men. ,

Kshema, son of Vamana, knaw that the king bore an‘
il will against his own father, sud advised him to rob
the umbrella and gold belungig to god Kalashesha set
up by hig futher. But he was preventer from this act
by the council of Prayazo, Haladhare’a grandson,

Loshtadhara, a courtier who entered like devil into the
heart of the ill-advised king, thus privately said to tha ,
king in order to please him: ‘ Confiscate the lands and
gold of Kalashesha, and with the stones of the tem-
ple, I shall build for” you a bridge over the Vitasts.”
The weak king who believes that a picture can be
pninted on the sky, or cloth” made of lily thread,
or thinks it possible to obtain the gold which is seen
only in dreams, or to make a wall of snow, is disappoint-
ed. The accomphshment of this plan was prevented
by Praydga, even asa good docter prevelts the desire of
food of his pationt,

One day in the midst of mirth and jollity, Loshta-
dhara asked the king to relieve an imprisoned god. Tho
king smiled and asked what he meant. He replied that
at Abhundapura there was a god named Bhfma possess-
ing gold and jewels. During the disturbance which
took place’among the king’s officers, in the time of Kala-
sha, the doors of the temple of Bhimnkeshava were long
elosed, And when the disturbance ceased and the doors
were opened, if was seen that thieves had stolen the
god’s golden kavacha. Thera beiug yet much wealth left,
the doors were closed again in feiv of the thieves; and

- since then the doors have remained closed, “Bring you,
therefore, the wealth from that place, aud the god too
relieved of confinement, shall receive flowers, &c.” The
king did as advised, and got much gold and jowels.
*If the god,”—so thought the king,—“ which is uot

KINGS OF KASIIMIR's. 251

worshipped, has so much wealth, what may not those
“possess which are receiving worship.” And when the
king, so thinking, went to rob any god, the people of
the place paid large ransom for it, which was brought on
elephants. Tho king intended*to complete his grand
army by plundering gods, and robbed every idol of
the wealth bestowed on it by former kings. After he
hod” plundered the idols of their wealth, he employed
Udayaréja for the purpose of bringing the images; and
in order to deprive them of their sanctity, he caused
urine and orduréto bo poured into them through the
orifices in thelr noses, hands and legs. Ue tovk away
all those images which were built of gould and silver,
The images were dragged by ropes tied rownd their
ancle-joints, spat upon and made naked, and mutilated,
Neither in the capital, nor in tuwns or villages, was
there a temple left from which the idul was ut taken
uut by Harsha the Turashka. Two influential yods were
beyoud hig- power, Shriranasvaud in the eapital, and
Martanda at Puttana. When the king was giving alms,
- two men asked for and obtained two images of Buddha,
and preserved them. One of these persons was Kanaka,
born at Parihasapurk, and the other was Shra-
mana, a good lovkiug singer, born in sume other town.«

ha robbed the gods, on whom the former kings bestowed
wealth, and still unable to defray his enormous expenses, ”
wished to get more. Fie to such king !

With the king's nominal consent, tho ministers ap-
pointed new men in the principal offices. Tia to the
time-serving servants! The minister Gouraka, though a
good mau, assisted the king in plundering the gods,
and became a principal financial officer (Arthangyaka),
Helaka, a Bréimana who served in the temple of
Samarasvami, nud who was formerly ‘@ confidential ofBcer
of Vijayamalia, and was at first, hated’ by the present
king, now doubled the tribute from the temple, and
became another principal financial officer; he was admitted
to the king’s presence, and gradually became the greatest
officer, What more need be said of a king who exacted
money through his various heads of departinents, and
appointed one over ordure, The money thus got was
spent on ‘avil purposes by the ignorant, hypocrite and
idle people who snrrounded the svvereigu. -The king's
mousey was spent in order to get stag-eyed women and
horses, to roceive the evil council of the courtiers, and
flattery of the minstrels. The king's time was spent
in appeasing his women’s angerar enjoying theér favor,

«it hearing description of hovses, in following the advice
of servants, oud in hunting. Kings walk, sit, drink,
feast, enjoy theraselves or are merry, or perform chayi-
table acts; following, like a shadow, the example of
other people, and without judging whether they ate

good or bad. Believing tho flattery of their mingtrels,
‘they consider themselves superhuman, and imagine that
they have one eye or two hands more than other people ;
nor ever think that they will have to die. Women
who gain ascendency over kings at night become their
ministers by day, and yet the foolish kings think that
they are powerful. What others pronounce to be good
is oattn by them with relish; what others pronounce as
bad is rejected by. them; and when others frighten
them, they are struck with sudden fear. Kings anid
boys are alike,* All thjs, which may be attributed to
kings in genetal, is a3 nothing compared to what king
Tlarsha did. Pleased with tho sound of drums, the king
gavo to Bhimandyaka, the musician, a pair of elephants,
male and female. Champake’s younger brother, Kanaka,
& pupil of Bhimandyaku, begun to learn singing in the
sorrow of hie beart ; and to assunge his sorrows, tha
king gave him one lac of golden dfundras} On one
’ occasion Harsha saw a picture of Chandal§, the beauti-
ful wife of Parmdudi, king of Karnata, and became
- enamoured of her, ‘Vile courtiers excite the foolish as
men excite dogs. Thus excited, Harsha shamelessly
vowgd before the courtsio destroy Parmdndi and to hava
Chandalé. He vowed nut to use prepared camphor till
he obtained her. The bards and minstrels Janghed at
him, concetling their ridicule in songa: ‘You are now
on your way to the south: there is cansphor in your
hand, as we kpow by its smell, and the camphur is pre-

pared; it is it forking Harsha to present it to his love.”
“Until the king of Karnéta is killed, and Chandalg
is won; until Kaly4napura is entered, and Pimmalé ig
visited, and the royal garden is left behind, the powerful
king will not use camplbr.” Madana, lord of Kampana,
rose high in the king’s favor for his getting the picture
to the king, and for which he rectived dress, ornaments,
anda daily pay. The king's foolishness and restldisness
became known by Madane’s shameless and flattering
words.

Some of the courtiers brought an ¢ld woman from
Kampana and told the king that she was ‘nis (the king’s)
mother, and so got some gold out of him. Others
bronght female servants and introduced them to the
king as goddesses ; and the king, forgetting his dignity,
bowed to them, while the others laughed. The female
servants, taught lewedness by the courtiers, madea fool
of the kidg; and the king’s good fortune and greatness
left him on account of his being addicted to them. The
king wished to have long life, and was so foolish as to ask
these servants (considering them as goddesses) for the
boon, and they granted him one hundred yenrs of life.
He was anxious to have funeral takes given to him after

» death, and one Domva gave him a certain liquid, chemi-
cally prepared, pretending that it ensured the cake after
death, and induced the king to drink it. What more can
be said of his foulishness? When asked by the courtiers,
he pretended to bestow on them long life as if it were

wealth in bis hand. +What good man can narrate those
shameful things which this sovereign did in order to
become handsome and strong? Thus, for a long time,
this bad and foolish monarch was thrown into troubles
by his own ministers, As ign orant people are now scep-
tical about the uncommonly good acts of king Megha-
véhana and others, so people will hereafter hesitate to
believe such uncommonly wicked things about king
Harsha, Though the kingdom was mismauaged, yet his
enemies could not take advantage of it so long as he
lived. One night, when the room was lightod by lamps,
and he was teaching dancing girls to dance, an enemy
from a distance shot an arrow at him. That he did not
perish, or was even struck by it, was either because the
time of his death had not yet come, or on account of
the sins of his subjects. Somehow the females of the
king's zenana became corrupt; the young women and
their youthful poramours planned his destrubtion. The
king, however, discovered their plot, and in anger
punished some of the women, and some eloped
with their lovers. The servants were afraid of their
own guilt, and wished to save themselves at their
masters cost, The kixg’s evil name spread on every side,
as was but right aud proper, he being the son of king,
Kalasha, He constantly took to his embraces matrons
of the rank of his mother (his aunts) who had taken him
on their Iaps when he was a child, and also Iadies of
the rank of his sister (bis cousins) and oppressed

Naga, the daughter of his father’s ‘sister, and foreed her .
to his bed. He had in his pay one hundred Turashka
princes, and to the day of his death he used to ent the
flesh of tame hog.*

On one occasion he’ got angry with the people of
Rajapmi on account of some defect in their offering
submission, and marched against that country. Other
kings saw his uncommonly large army on the way and
cousidered him powerfui enough to atlack the three
worlds, Harsha sat down with the army before R&ja-
purf. After a siege of ono month, the ood within the
fort became scarco, and Sangrémapila, the King of the
pluce, in order to relieve his men, went out to make
peace, promising such tribute and homage as king Harsha
might order. Harsha, fixed on his purpose of conquest,
refused the terms; but the king of Réjapuri won over
the avaricious Dandangyaka by bribe. When the king
of Kishmfra retired from the army to his camp, Danda-
ndyaka secretly induced the soldiers to démand extra
pey for having left their country behind. The rude and
proud soldiers demanded the extra pay, but they were
disappvinted, as the king’s treasury was at a distance.
Now, when the king was appeasitig the soldiers, Danda-

“niyoka frightened him by saying that the Turashkas
would attack him. Tho king had very little patience;

* We should make allowance for the facts and opinion of
historian who lived in the reign of one whuse net very remote
Ancestor had usurped the throne of Harsha,

he withdrew his afmy from the place, and fled in fear,

‘*Jeaving his treasure and baggage in the way. Servants
who are favored without being tested, bring on troubles
in times of danger like a sword which is taken to battle
without being examined. The king himself was unwor-
thy, and disregarded worthy persons. From this time
the fame of his power abated. Now he admitted the
mighty prowess of Kandarpa, who had done what he and
his army could not, The king wished to bring back
Kandarpa, but was prevented by the wiles of Danda-
néyaka. The ting arrssted Dandangyska, knowing his
disaffection, but did not persecute hita on account of
entreaty of his courtiers. Dandangyaka, when in coufine-
mont, did uot take milk, nox the things sent to him by
his friends, but stored them. The foolish king after-
wards reinstated him in his former post, although he
had deserved capital punishment. The courtiers again
excited the king with flattery, as Karna, &e, did
Duryyadhdna after his defeat at Ghoshajitra. He who
is beaten in arguments abuses his opponent, the unchaste
woman scolds and taxes her husband, and the Kéyastha
who has robbed much wealth throws the king in trouble;
thus tley cover theirown defects and prosper.

Now the selfish Hela, who had appropriated the money
entrusted to him for distribution to others, became
afrajd, and tried to induce the king to some evil action,
He advised him, in conjauetion with the people of
Lohara, to capture the fort of Dhé&te in order to subju

gate the province of Darad. This: fort was formerly _
held by Lakvanachandra the Damara, but he was killed
by Janake the lord of Dvaéra by the orders of king
Ananta, and his wife died of starvation at Dvara, But
the fort was gubsequently again taken by the king of
Darad through the negligence of king Kalasha. The
people of Darad had also taken Anantagréma, The
king was ready to lead the army, In that country there
was no lake, and the people used to collect snow for the
purposes of water. In tha present year there was no
rain, and they had consumed their sno¥, Hela, other-
wise called Mabattama, saw their weakness’ and excited
the king against them, and the king prepared hiroself
for the march, At this time the lord of Dv4ra was
proceeding to Vataganda by the king’s order. Champaka
tried to betray him, but the king prevented him from
proceeding and made him lord of Mandala, and he ruled
over DySra’ with other lords of Dvdra. The king then
took the lord of Dvara with him and, crossing the river
Madhumati, invested the fort with his army. Hoe sent
the officors of his army on all sides, and remained alone
himself within his entrenchment at a distance from the
army. The battle raged between: the two armies, and
-mthe soldiers of Darad from within their fort hurled
atones on their enemies. Malla, son of Gangga, with his
sons, did many acts of valor at Dhita, and he also built
a religious house. An astrologer had foretold that his
son would gat « kingdom, and so his heroic sons, Uch-

obala and Sussala, tried to increase their fame, The elder

ad

ef them, aspiring to the throne, set out for the war on
the side of the king, and won great reputation. The
enemy could hardly keep the fort ou account of want of
rain and of the powers of the fee. But at this moment
a heavy shower of rain, unfriendly to Harsha, overflowed
the,country ; and the tops of the fort was covered with
ice ag if clad in mail. Fate raises the falling and throws
down the aspiring, as if playing with a Kundake (ball),
Troubled with rain, and remembering the comforts of
home, the wicltd minijsters collected themselves within
the king’s-enctmpment, The king returned from the seat
of war, disappointed of his hope of suecess, and the
soldiers began to desert and run away, leaving behind
their arms, baggage and treasure. They were pursned
by the enemy, and many of them perished in the large
river. On the waves of the Madhumatf floated tho
clothes, arms, horses, &o., of the retiring army. The
"number of men that perished in the river and the
number killed or captured by the victorious army of
* Darad cannot be counted. Uchcehala, with his younger
brother, tried to save the soldiers of Kashmira thus left
without leaders. Thess two brothers, like two rocks on the
beach, checked the rushing and sea-like army of Darads..
They won great reputation by protecting the army, and
henceforward people considered these two proud men,
and nat the impotent king, worthy of the kingdom. The
veneration of the people for them rose atill higher,
because after auch acts they did mot coudescend to pre-

sent themselves before the king: Harsha was now |
relieved of the fear of the enemy and entered his capital,
The people compared the brothers with Rama and
Lakshmana and the king with Ravana, (thereby fore-
shadowing a coming event, viz, the dethronement of
Harsha by the brothers),

The shameless and idle king, not in any way deprassed
by his late reverses, began to oppress his subjects as
usnal, Mean minded people punish those who are near
for small offences, not those who commit serious crimes
ata distance. The dog bites the.stone, but not the man
who throws it at him. The king once heard that
Madana, whom he had created lord of Kampana, spoke of
the king’s late defeat; he was angry with him and
wished for his death. Ho also found fault with hin,
because he did not perform certain act as the queen
commanded. Mnadann was caught at Madava and was
brought béfore the king, but in fear he took refuge in
the house of the rich minister named Jhakka. Though
hie minister begged the king to spare Madana’s life, yet
the king caused Madaua and his sons to be killed by his
soldiers. The king’s anger could never be appeased.
Such is the doom of those who defend on their @quain-
tance with the great and serve them without fear. On
the day of Madano’s death on the banka of Karnejapa,
the curse of queen Stiryyamat{ was fully realized.

Afraid of the power of Kalasharéja, the king confined
him fu the house of Lakshmfdhara, and in order to kill
him, sent to him his enemy, Udaya, on the pretence of


--- Page 270 ---
f Eres oF KASHMERA. 261

learning ‘something ‘from him. The proud Kalashardaja
“saw the other blazing in prosperity, became very angry,
and snatched a sword and killed him. But the angry
servants of the murdered man killed Kalashardje, Thus
the servants of the foolish king began to perish one
after another.

Ag salt brings additional pain to sores, so the country,
oppressed by tha king, suffered additional calamities,
The Vishas stole gold plates from the king’s palace, but
they died before the sun arose. A great pestilence broke
out, and gradudily incrensed, and the wnilings of people
and Funeral music ceased not by day or by night, In
the year 735 of the Kashurfrian era, a famine broke out
in tho village of Udfyakradita, and all the stores became
empty. One khari of grain sold at five hundred dinniras,
two pala of vine-juice sold for a dinnfra, and one pala of
wool sold at six dfundras ; while salt, black pepper, and
assafcotids could not be had at all. Rivers were filled up
with dead* bodies, which were swollen with water.
The king, on the other hand, perfectly indifferent to these
calamities, observel that his capital could not be seen
from o distance owing to the trees which surrounded it,
and: orfered them té be cut down. The trees, with
flowers and fruits, were accordingly cut down, and the=
black bees moaned everywhere over them, as persons
lament over the dead bodies of their relatives. Advised
by the Kéyasthas, the king severely oppressed the sur-
viving people everywhere m cities aud iu villages. The

Damaras became viotous, and her ordered the lord of
Mandala to massacre them, The DAmaras inhabiting °
Madava and Lohara were first attacked and murdered
like birds in the nests. Even the Bréhmanas who dwelt
at Madava were not spared by the destroyer of the
Lavanyns (Démaras). Poles were fixed on the place where
the Dimaras were executed. One wife of a Lavanya was
impaled, the rest were terrified, and fled on all ‘sides.
Some fied to the country of the Mlechchhas and lived on
beef, others took to working wheels at wells. The lord
of Mandala sent to the fierce king marly garlands made
of the heads of the Lavanyas. The gates‘of the palace
was seen filled with Dimara heads. Gold, cloth, and
other valuable things were kept at the palace-gate, and
whoever brought » Daémaia head obtained one of them
from the door as his reward. And the birds lingered at
the king's gate to feed on human heads. Wherever the
king stopped, the gates were adorned with garlands of
Démara heads. The bad smell which arose, and the cry :
of jackals, made the place appear like the spot assigned
for the burning of the dead. From the tank at Valeraks
to Lokapunya, the lord of Mandala erected a row of the
impaled Démaros. After having quite depepulated

ow Madava of the Damaras, the lord of Mandala intended to
do the same with Kramargjya, aud marched towards it,
In despair the Démaras of this place collected an army
at Louldhe, They fought a fierce battle, and the lord of
Mandala was for a time beffled, But the king, likes

Réleshosa! waa bent on destroying this beautiful kingdom,
“ome wise mon of the time have said that the king was
fond of revelry in the night, and sleep in the day ; that
he was fond of cruelty aud tumult, disregarded duty and
liked bad works, ‘These are the peculiar vices of Rak-
shasas.

In the meantime the younger and youthful son of
Malla’ became the delight of the wife of Lakshm{dhara,
The lady was enamoured of the prince Sussala, who lived
in her neighbourhood, and disliked hor husband, whose
form was like that ofa moukey. Now Lakshmilhara,
urged by‘angef and jealousy, asked the king why, after
murdering innumerable kinsmen, he had spared the two
brothers, Ushchals and Sussala, who might be kings
hereafter. The king had nover felt any regret for the
massacre of his kinamen. But in the present instance,
when Lakshmfdhara repeatedly urged the same thing
to the king, and caused it to be repeated by othets, the
king remembered the high spirit of the brothers, and
was afaid to kill them. And forgetting the love which
- kinsmeu bear to one another, he consulted his ministers,

and came to the determination to murder them. Thak-

kan&, % prostitute who had heard the consultation,
informed the youths of the king’s evil design. The fact -
was confirmed by their friend Darshanapdla, and they
fled that very night with two or three attendants,

Démaras. One of the Lavanyas, named Prasuastargjo,
intending to vise against the king, sent his youngeg ‘
brother Silleréja, and invited the youths to his territory,
But the elder Uchchala went to Rajapurf in the king-
dom of Kahle, and the’ younger went to the king of
Kalingjara. None ever thought at that time that these
exiles would one day be kings.“ Only the king, who
understood business and saw the state of things,
became alarmed. Through Lakshmfdhara, the king pro-
mised wealth to Sanggrémapdla if “he would murder
Uchchala. But when the son of Malla (Uchchala) went
to Sangerémapila, the latter became afraid of, him, and
welcomed him and praised him. ven the enemy and the
envious wore lod by fate to honor him who was destined
to rise to fortune. The people of R&japuri were the
natural enemies of the people of K4shmira, and were pre-
pared to do anything against the latter when instigated
and helpedby influential enemies of Kashmfra. Uchchala
had frequent interviews with some of the Démaras who
went to him. The oppressed D&marns were thus greatly
encouraged, and sent messengers with many presents to
bring Uchchala back into Kashmfra. Janaka, son of
Suryavarnachandra, sent him a “diplomatic mersenger
wand thereby encouraged him, Seeing so many messen-
gera of the Démaras, Sanggrémapéla was relieved of -his
fear of the king, and now openly honored Uchchala.
When Sanggrémapéla was on the point of placing cam-
phor on the head of Uchchala as a pledge of not harming

him, thee came ond Kalashardja, a principal Thalkkura

‘ef Réjapurf, who was bribed by king Iarsha; and he
said the following words to Sanggr4mapdéla in private :—
“You have not done what would please king Marsha,
and have come to serve Uchehala. Consider duly the
power of the king of Késhmira, and that of this beggar.
Seryg the king and so save yourself, Confine this man
within the onstle of Rajagir{, and then the king will give
you what you desira; and out of fear (for having Uchchala
in your hold) he willever bethy friend.” The king of the
Khashas, when fhus adlrossed, became frightened and
consented ‘to the proposal, and replied,—“I cannot cap-
ture this spirited man, but I shall send him to you on
some pretence, and then you can bind him.” Thug
saying he sent Kalashardja to his house, and told
Uchchala to go to Kalasharéja on the morning. “He
is the principal minister here,” said Sanggrémapéla to

_, Uchchala, “and when you become his friend, we shall
march with you snd your followers to destroy your ene-
roies.” On the next day, when Uchehala was going to

"the minister’s house, he saw il} omens, and was then told
by his men about the purpose of the minister; and ha
fled fron? Rajapurf.

On the other hand, when the king of the Khashag |
heard that, owing to the discovery of the plan, his victim
had fled, he set out with hisarmy, On hearing of his
approack, the great warrior Uchchala, with his followers,
intended to mect him in battle. But when the bate

was about to commence, the king of the Khashas pre-
vented the engagement, and brought Uchohala together,
with Kalashargja into his court. Disregarding the
advice of his followers and burning with anger, Uchchala
entered the court of this king. There was none who
could now look the spirited and angry warrior in
tho face. 7
Uchchala thus addressed to the king and his mixtéters
with harsh and angry words: “Formerly at Dérvvabhi-
sara there lived a king named Nara of the Gotra of
Bhéradvaéja, who had a son named Noravabana, and
Narayghana had a son named Phulla, Phulla had a son
named Sérthav4hana, his son was Chandana, and Chan-
daua had two sons, Gopala and Sinhargja, Sinhardja
had several children, his daughter Didd& was married
to Kshemagupta. Diddé made Sanggrémardja (son
of her brother Udayaréja) king. She had another
brother, Kéntiréja, and be had a son named Jassargja,
Sanggramargja had a son named Ananta, while of Jasse- *
r4ja were born Tanvangga and Gungga. -Ananta’s son was
Kalasharaja, aud of Gungga was born Malla. Kalasha’s
son is king Harshadeva, and we are Malla’s sons !* Why
then do the wicked enquire who we are? But eq.long as
~the earth is for the enjoyment of the powerful, wherein
is the necessity for genealogy? And who is the friend
of the powerful, but his own arms. Fortunately the

the favor of their subordinates, and you will now see
my valor.” When he had said this, he went ont for
battle followed by oue hundred foot soldiers. One man
brought a dead hare before him, which he considered a
good omen.

Now Vittadeva and other Démeras left theic work at,
wheels and joined him, Uchchala loft Saugrémapéla and
his army and arrived at Rajapurf, where the queens
assisted him. He took his meals there, and when in the
evening he was going to his residence, the army of Kala-
shargja attacked him outside the palace. The gates of
the palace too were closed by the “queens after he had
gone out. In this affray, Uchohala lost Loshtdvates and '
others, And when the principal men of the place inter-
vened and stopped the combat, Uchchala’s small army
became smaller. . t

He was reduced to much difficulty on “he day of full: '
moon in the month of Chaitra, but on the fifth day of
the dark moon he fearlossly set out for battle, He
allowed Vattadeva and others to take their own courso
that they might create confusion in the kingdom. He
intended to enter Késhmira by the way which led
through Eramardjya. Kapila, grandson of Kehema,
whom the king had placed at Lohara after, Udayasiha, *
fled as Uchchaola entered the place. Ushchala moved
before his army with sword and shield, and arrived at
Parnotsa, and there compelled the royal army to fly.
He onptured Sujjaka, Lord of Gvara, who was xeposing
at ease and apprehended no danger, and soon entered
Kashmira. Some of the Démaras and the people of
Ehasha, who inhabited the mountains and who were ene
mies of the king, now joined Uchchala. ‘

King Marsha trembled to hear that the onemy was so
pear him, all unexpected, and as if he had fallen from the
sky or risen from the ground. He was at a loss to think
as to how to prevent Uchchala from entering Kramarajya
and killing the Lord of Mandala. Dandan4yaka, who
had collected an army, being delayed, the king sent
Patta with a large force, But whether it was the
will “ef the gods, or bocause he was seized with n
“desir to rise in rebellion, Patta avoided the enemy and
loitered in the way. Tilakargja and others, whom the king
had sont, joined Patta, but did not advance on the
enemy. Dandindyaka and others were also puzzled, so
that Uchchala gained firm footing.

When Uohchala was entering Vardéhamiils, a good-
omened mare came to him from the enemy's side, and the
garland fell from the neck of the Great Varéha (an in-
carnation of Vishnu) on his head, as if crowning him
king of the world. Kaka and other warriors, born of
“Vaidya caste, opposed Uokchala, so that he left Hushka-
pura and turned towards Kramarajya. Hearing of his

. approach, the DAémaras became excited and rebelled
against the Lord of Mandala. They killed Yashardja
and other good warriors, and defeated the Lord of
Mandala and crippled his power. The Lord of Mandala
slowly retreated to Tiramdilaka, and the Damaras, led by
Uchchala, followed him there. The Lord of Mandala was
at thé head of his army and could not for a long time be
captured. A’great battle was fought between the two

armies. On the other hand A’naida, maternél uncle of
Uchchala, assisted by a great number of Démaras, effectoy”
arising at Madava. At the time of rebellion the Dimaras
came from all sides by thousands, like the black bacg
from the caves of the Himalayas when the winter is
over, The unfortunate king had under him Sahela the
great at Kampana, who was useless to him, like the Lord
of Dvérn, He was attacked by Ananda, and after fight
ing many battles fled from Mnadava. .On the other hand,
Uchchala surrounded the Lord of Mandala and captured
him with his army. Who can describe fhe foeling of tho
soldiers whon they knew that, armed and protected by
mail as they wero, they had been made oaptives.
Though captured, the Lord of Mandala still remained
Joyal, wishing well of his king; for honorable per-
sons, even when in extreme danger, do not forget their
fidility to their masters. He advised the conqueror
immediately to enter the town, (capital?) inducing
him to believe that he would not htve snother
similar opportunity. He thought that Uchchala’s army
would be busy in plundering the villages and city when
Uchchala would be euteriug the capital, and so there
would be a diversion. Uchchala was accordingly induced
immediately to enter Parihfsapare, whence exit was
difficult on account of the water on all sides. The Lord
of Mandala then urged his own men to set fire at night
tothe house in which he aud Uchchala lodged, but his
mon refused to do so and thus saved his life. If his body

RINGS OF RASHMIRA, 271

had beef as strong as his mind was vigorous, what would
not he have effected who did not care for his own life,
Fie to Fate, who is partial to the low, and makes heroea
weak in body, while neuters receive full development.
The hide of the tortoise which lives in water is impene-
trable, while the skin of the lion, who braves battles, ig
left, without the hard ‘cover. The Lord of Mandala sent
a méssage to the king that he had induced the fox
(Uchohala) into that place, and had thrown him bofore
the lion (the king), and asked him to come out and kill
the fox. The*king nyarched with his soldiors, a]l deter-
mined either to conquer or to die. The royal army
reached the bridge of Bharata, aud by some contrivance
killed the euemy’s soldiers and crossed the bridgo.
The Lord of Mandala, who was at the enemy's post, now
joined the king’s army, and attacked the enemy and
killed many of them. When Uchchala’y army was
broken, some of the Jéngdhik4s fled, and Some of the
Damaras ‘took shelter within the Réjavihgra. Que
Démara named Trillasena entered the Vihéra, the royal-
ists mistook him for Uchchala, and burnt the building,
Uchchala and Somapéla fuught fora loug time in the

even as gamblers become with a little success, the king
praised himself and returned to his capital. Te did not-
pursue his enemies, a circumstance which encouraged
the D&maras, notwithstanding their defeat. In the
mouth of Jaishtha the prudent Uchchala determined to
re-assemble his men who had fled. This undaunted man,
although defeated, had full reliancé on his own strength,
ond made extraordinary preparations in the midet Of a
famine.* When Uchchala had got possession of Pari-
h&sakeshaya he had preserved the image, but the king,
on obtaining possession of the town, uprooted it, and
from that time to the timo of the king’s decapitation,
the sky remained pervaded with an ash color. This
part of the country had formerly been dark, oven in day
time lighted only by Rupikd (a kind of plant), but had
become lighted, as the people say, since the image of
the god had been set up. Now it became dark again.
The king, now that the enemies were a little checked,
became inflated. Sussala now appeared towards Shfira-
pura, He was the younger brother of Uchchala, and had
lived at Avangha, where he was roused from his lethargy
by his father’s rebuke and order to join his elder
brother. The king of Kalpa assisted him with a few
horsemen, and it was long before he could part from his
benefactor, and hence his delay. The brothers, who had
hitherto manifested a bitter hostility to the enemy,
now employed milder means in order to deceive'the

enemy. “Sussala gained a victory over the king’s com-
~monder Ménikya, and won not only reputation, but
wentth also from the battle-field of Shirapura. Thus
the opening of his career was brilliant. The king dis-
regarded Uchchala and sont thé Lord of Mandala, Patta
and others, to fight with Sussala, who was rapidly advan-
cing. Sussala broke the army at Shtirapura, and many
of thd king’s soldiers were drowned and perished in the
water of the Vaitaranf. In this battle the rebellious and
powerful Darshanapéla was defeated. The survivors of
the king’s broken army fled on the next day to Sahela,
who lived at Bokapunya. Sahela fearing an attack from
Sussala, took shelter with the remnant of that broken
army within the city. Thus the king was brought to
straits by Sussala, His brother Uchchala, who was at

Téramula, gained ascendance.
Uschohola was led by the Démaras, who were mostly
foot soldiers, and who terrified the cavalry; and once
“more passed through the difficult mountain path which
led to Lohara, The king too again made Udayardja
. Lord of Dvara, and sent the Lord of Mandala to Lohara to
snbdue Uchchala. The maternal uncle of Uchchala and
Susgala.now arrived ‘at Padmapura, and none of the
king’s ministers ventured to accept from tha king the
governorship of Kampana, And the king asked, with a
sigh, “who is there for me?’ On which Chandrardja took
from" the king’s hand the garland of investment to the
lordship of “Kampana, This man acted ea befitted the

line of Jindurdja, &c., who slept with death. * Thus he
was made the Commander-in-Chief in the last hour 7
danger, just as the son of Drona was made by Duryo-
dhana. He marched out, and drove the enemy from
Padmapura. In the month of Bhades, on the ninth
bright lunar day, the usurper of Kampana (the maternal
uncle of the rebel brothers) was killed at Avantipyra by
Chandrargja, who was slowly going on in his march of
conquest. His death happened in this wise. Leaving
his army to fight near Gobarddhanadhara, he was hear-
ing songs, attended only by few persdns, when he was
Surprised and killed by his enemy's “cavalry which
went by the way along the Vitast&. Where do the
careless prosper? The king saw his head which Chon.
drarfja had sent to him, and thought that fortune wags
yet in his favor, and hoped for victory. Fortune, when
she deserts, sometimes turns back, even as a lion turns
back when retreating. Chandraréja, thus strengthened,

slowly entered Vijayakshetra, dividing his army into
eight or ten divisions.

Like the weighman, Fortune would not keep the tio
scales unadjusted. On the third day, the Lord of Man-
dala’s army were put to great trofible at Lohara by un-
timely rain. The soldiers, oppressed by the cold wind,
and drowned in the mud of the paddy-fields, soon left
their horses, swords, mails, &c. Though the kind-hearted
Uchchala protected the Lord of Mandala, he was found out
and killed by Ganakochandra ond others, Horsho’a

officers wére mostly rebellious, but this man won fama
‘sy sacrificing himself. Like Devasharmmo’s, this man’s
high virtues axe adorable ; for had they been otherwise,
some one or other at least would have spoken ill of
him. °
About this time Uchchala, who had beon to Hiranya-
pura, was coronated by Bréhmanas there. Harsha heard
this Bad became disheartened, and was advised by many
ministers who were with him to go to the hills of Lohara
with them,—"There the subjects were submissive to
you before, and are displpased with their new king, and
they will soon cme totake you there, or you may yourself
proceed to tho spot.” But the king replied that he could
not depart all of a sudden leaving his wives, his treasures,
his throne and other valuable things behind. His advi-
sers urged that faithful men could rido with the females
aud treasures of the king, and as for the throne, it
would be no disgrace if others sate on it, seeing that
“kings, who loved women of the low caste eating dog's
flesh, had once filled it, “ Let that go,” said the king;
“say if,you have other advice to give.” The ministers
angrily replied that kings who ruled in accordance to tha
maxims ,of Kshetriyasy and considered death in a battle
a blessing, gave no rest to theirarmy in this world.
Want of endeavour, vanity, fear, and difference among
ministers and not enemies, were the foca that increased
the danger of the kings. The idle who did not super.
intend his ‘work, but relied on his servants, met

276 KINGS OF KASHMERA,

danger at every step, like a blind man who ¢rusted to
his staff, The fool, blinded with vanity, who did not arn”
himeelf even against a small enemy, wilfully suffered the
enemy to gainstrength, Even Indra in time might degene-
rate into a reptile, and even o reptile might attain the
greatness of Indra. So to think that one is strong and
another is weak was improper vanity. He whose pre-
parations are incomplete can strike panic in & con-
queror, can destroy him though he,be complete in his

preparations. Even the rich and well-to-do people were

sometimes attacked by the poer, and thoso dependent
on others ; and why were the former overcome and were

afraid of the latter? Or why could they not show

their powers? Nothing could be accomplished when

there was difference among the ministers, as in har-

rowing nothing was done if the two frames were drawn

by turns instead of being drawn together. Though

the king ‘Were possessed of all the resources af the

country, but depended on hope, his enemy, though

weak, could take his life and his kingdom. He who

followed the enemy and marched only to* places
attacked by the foe, never conquered. Fortune might

be adverse, yet if the king fall in battle, surroutded by

warriors, he wonfame. Only the fortunate fell in the

furious battlefield, their pride satisfied, their perdons

deserving of respect, and all blessings realized in them.

Considering death in battle a noble action, the . Kshe

triyes became fearless as gamblers,

“The miinisters wh gave this advice were, however,
“osked by Harsha to give other counsel ; on which they
sighed and seid to the king, whose time of death was
drawing near,— “Can you die in the hour of danger as
Utkarsha did, for otherwise some unworthy fate will
befal you.” Hoe replied to them that he conld not kill
himgelf, and asked them to kill him when in extrema
danger. When they heard tho uomanly words of their
master, they wept gud suid that they could not help him,
as they were not bestowed with the powor to do so. Surely
the king had employed Yeasts in human shape. Though
you may live for o yuga, still you shall have to die in
the ond ; therefore it isshame for servants to display
cowardice when success can he achieved by the sacrifice of
ones body. Even women enter fire thinking of thoir love
for their lords. ‘Who then en be baser than be who for-
gets his love for his master? Those who, liko actors,

perity live on the lips of kings is verified in me alone
in Kali yoga, Why should a mortal grieve at the
approach of death, when Rudra, Upendra, Mahendra
shall pass away. One thought alone grieves me, viz,
that, through my fault, the world which was like a wife,
will be like an old fomale servant in the possession of
any ono who is powerful enough to win her, From this
time, now that the kingdom is weak, any one will aspire
to it, knowing that it is attainable by cozispiracy. Those
that are rising, though of small strength, will laugh in —
pride to see the fruitlessnoss of mighty attempts. Even
impartial peoplo do not blame the endeavour if it ends in
brilliant success, The parade of wealth that I made
for the benefit of the people will now be reckoned as
stupidity. Uchchala, who is rising by his own exertion,
will laugh at my good works. I am calm through
shame, and not through fear, for I wish for this sort of °
death. For I wish it to be said of me that if my own
people had not snatched the kingdom from me, ‘no one -
else could have taken it. In old times,” continued Har-
sha, “there was a king named Muktépida, who waa ashin-
ing light among kings, “But his enemies took advantage
of his weakness, and he died miserably. Muktapfda nad
left his army at various places at Dttardpatha, and, when
attended by a few men, had his passage opposed by
his enemies over a difficult way. There king Shalya,

with eight lacs of ‘horse, determined 10 capture him,
*without any arms as he was. Mukt4p{do’s judgment
was bewildered at the failure of all his plans, and he
asked his chief minister, BhavasvAm{, as to what was to
be done. The minister, after cool deliberation as to the
means of escape, and knowing destruction to be inevita-
ble, said that those who aspire after fame, follow the
path “of duty and keep their judgment sedate. Those
who understand iheir duty, try to maintain their fame,
and the attainment of kingdom follows of itself. When
the body porishes, and is reduced to ashes, man is
remembered Hy his fame, even as camphor is known by
smell, When life is extinct, the name of the renowned
still dwells in the tongues of those who praise him. To
be famous is to live till the end of time (kalpa), for
fame exists without diminution. ‘Tho sedate do not
think of money when the enemy attempts to rob wealth
_ and power. Brahmé often disyraces those in high posi-
tiou; through the agency of the elephant he destroys
the lily from which he himsel#was borv, and he insulta
the modn through the Chandéla (eclipse). They who can
maintain their fame from such vicissitudes which destroy

thy fame. Pretend to be suddenly ‘attacked with Don,
dakélasaka disease, which kills speedily, and I shall telle
you to-morrow what more you will havo to do to avert
the danger.’ Thus saying the prime minister withdrew,
and reached his own house, The king pretended to
have that disease, and rolled on the ground restlessly and
wept, and kept his eyes steadfast. “Perspiration, spasms,
vorniting and pains in the body, indicated to the foople
that the king was dying. The minister pretended to
believe that the king would die, and in order to show his
gratitude, perished by enteringnto firé. The minister
did not say to the king what was to be doe next (as ho
had promised to do.) But the king was in heart pleased
with him at his self-sacrifice, ond aaid that he was
young and was able to bear pain, and so he too entered
into fire. Thus by his selfsacrifice he attained fame
which he had not obtained by his deeds. So, if ang
disgrace comes to the great, they cnn rid themselyes of
it either by their own or by their minister's judgment.”
When king Harsha had said this, the ministers advised
him to send his son Bhoja within the fort that ‘his line
might not be extinet. After the prince had set out with
due ceremunies, the king, through the advice ofDanda-
n&yoka, caused him to return, Judgment, courage, and
presence of mind, all were at once lost in the impending
danger. Wealth, fame, heroism, and power, are all aub-
servient to good fortune, even as lightening, herons,
thunder, and rainbow, sll depend upon clouds. In

his dayd of prospefity, the people wondered why the
\king, who was superior to all in wisdom and valor, did
not attack Indra ; and in the days of his misfortune, they
wondered why the king, who was so foolish, infirm, inert
and blind, was born on earth. ,
The king allowed travelling allowance to the Tantré
soldiers who were within the town, and whom he sent
in ‘omer to oppose the enemy. The king’s servants,
with their friends, took shelter with the opposite party ;
and those who did not go were induced to remain by
money, Only “two oz, three remained faithful aud did
not think of’ going over to the enemy, but why should
they be praised who died like women. There was one
dancing girl named Kénashravat{ born in the family of
dancing girls, She adopted one Jayamat{ of unknown
parentage as her child. Now, when this latter attained
her youth, she did not marry, but loved Uchehala,
Avarigious of wealth, she first entered the zenana of the
’ Lord of Mandala ; and on his death she shamelessly went
over to Uclichala, and through her good fortune became
the principal queen. The king’s servants shamelessly
went over to Uchchals, placing their gure at their head,
and accepted his pay aiid thus lost the respect of the army,

advised the king to kill him without fear. The king
attacked his house in person, and femained stationed at
the door, Malla came out to satisfy the kingrdf his
innocence, and though entyeated by his sons, the saint-
like mau did not leave the king. In order to gain the
king’s confidence, Mall, sont out from his house the
step-brothers of Uchchala, uamed Sablana, &c. The king,
whose death was nigh, was angry with Malla, who lived
asa hermit and worshipped fire. While he was wor-
shipping his gods, he was summoued by his enemies, and
he issued ont in that very dress to fight. He issued out
in his attire of devotion with ashes, &c., on his forehead.
The black” and the white hair on his head looked like
the meeting of the rivers at Prayaga. His cap was his '
helmet his umbrella, his shield, and his stick his sword.
Some of his servants whom he had treated kindly fell in
the scuffie before he came out. Two Brgéhmanas, named
Rathavatts. and Vijaya, as well a% Pouragava, Koshtaka
and Sajjuka algo perished in the affray. Udayardja was
wounded, but not killed. When Malla saw the dsors
completely beset with the enemy’s soldiers, he, leaving
his work aside, leapt on their heads, White through age,
he moved over the awords and shields, like a hangsa, over

the mczs and lotus, and within a short time was seen
_ lying down pierced with a hundved sharp arrows. The
king was riding over the place and cut off, in bis pride,
the head of Udayardja, who was already dead. What
action of the king was not miserable ?

Queen Kusumalekha, beloved of Malla, perished by
throwing horself in the fire that was kept up in the house.
The foung wives of Sahlans and Rahla, named Aptasntt
aud Sahajé, daughters-in-law of Malla, also perished in
the fire. “Six fomales of tho family, delicately brought
up, thus perished in tho flames, These conilayrations
took place onthe lefé banks of the Vitaslé; and the
fires and hot tears warmed the waters of tho river.
Nandé (wife of Matla,) mother of the future kings, aud
descended of noble family, was living in the zenans on the
other side of the river, when she saw the smoke of the
fire and became anxious. She saw from the terrace of
her house the armies of her sons on the north'and south,

* aud cursed the king that, within few days, her sons would
yevengs the death of their father, even as Parashwrdma
did. She then perished in the fire which was kept up in
the house ; 28 also Chéudré, 8 nurse who was unable ta

ashes of one girl whom she had nursed with her milk,

moore, Malla was killed on the ninth dark lunar day ins
the month of Bhadra; and when his sons heard of it,
their grief was only replaced by anger.

On the next day Sussala went in fury from the villages
of Vahnipuraka, &c., to Vijayakshetra. Chandrardja set
out to meet Sussala, but was deserted by Patta and
Darshanapéla with their armies ; but though desert&d, he
fought gallantly for a long time with his small army in
apite of preat odds, In this battle, two of the king's
favorites, Akshotamalla and Chaécharimalta, fell. Chon-
drar4jo, and after him Indur 4ja, were also Killed, On the
fall of Chandrar dja, all hopes of success left king Harsha,

When Sussala entered the country, Patta and others
were alarmed and wore the garb of king’s fatterers,
entered the palace, and shut and bolted the doors after
them. The courtier Padma was wounded in the scuffle
outside, and Lakshmidhara, who wished to dig, was
brought by the Damaras bound. Sussala went up the
treasury at Vijayeshvara, and saw below the royalists
panicestruck like beasts. The wily Sussala smibed and
gave assurance of safety, and so caused Patia and Darsha-
napala to be brought before him, As there avas no
staircase, the followers of Sussala pulled them up like
dead men with ropes tied round their hands. But
Sussala relieved them of all troubles by consenting to
their proposal of going out to foreign countries and bide
their shame. But after listening to the kind words of

Suasala,? and making a comfortable repnst over fried
imeat, their ardour to leave the country cooled on
that very day. Sussnla obtained possession of the place
by the most wonderful means. For J4sata, son of the
maternal uncle of Marsha, and Umédhara, é&o., three other
Réjas, as well as Rajpoot cavalry and Tantri chieftains,
and a larga army, still remained on the side of the king.
While these collected in the courtyard of gol Vijaye-
shvara, Sussala went up, breaking through the gate, alone
and sword in hand, and abused them in anger. Thoy sub-
mitted, and hohssured,them of safety and made tha god
witness of histassurauce. Aud when he had re-navended
his house, his people brought to hig palace, adorned with
gold and silver hilted swords, those rvyalists who had
laid down their arms, their hands tied with repes. fe
placed them under the custody of the Damaras, aul they
were herded like beasts.
Suggala remained there for three days, after which he
’ get out, and when he had reached the villuge of Suvar-
nasdnura, the liberated Patta and Darshanap4la, who
consertied to go into foreign countries. Patta then went
to Sivapura, where he joined his wife, but the weak mag
forgot sis promise to‘Zo into exile. And whatever inten-
tion Darshanopéla may have had to leave his country,
was now relinquished for his friendship for Patta.
Now Sussala obtained possession of tha capital, and
intended to usurp the kingdom fur himself before lua
brother could arrive. And with this object ho thunght

other, and were of the same age, and both were powerful, 4
fo that there was equality between them. In two or
three days Sussala attacked several places, but remained
in the neighbourhood of the capital,

Bhojadeva, otherwise called Vupya, son of king Harsha,
get out for battle in order to burn Kalasha built by
Sussale. Harsha, who feared that his sons migh? turn
against him as he had rebelled agninat his father,
brought thera up as weak and spiritless men. But now,
in this time of helplessness, when +here waS noue to check
the prince, he led armies in some battles. ‘If this prince
had been brought up as his great-grandfather had, could
he not have cleared the country of tho rebellious king-
men? All mon know politics, but mistake in its applica-
tions ; many there are who are learned in the Shastras,
but few are practical men. The son should not he

(sesamum orientale) is covered with rind, yet who discards
the perfumed oil which comes out of it. The prince
showed great ability in fighting against his p&werful
enemy. .

The wicked Pittha, son of DeveShvara, who hnd been
honored and promoted by the king, joined the enemy's
side. Pittha’s son, Malla, requested the king to allow
him to go to battle against Sussala, and was at last
allowed by Harsha to go to battle. “You will knew my
heart to-day, O! king,” said the proud Malla as he went

i disaffection) in battle in which he fell. The king wag
not more grieved at the entire ruin which came upon
him, than he was because he knew not before the loyalty
of this grateful man. Kings, puffed up with wealth and
ignorance, know not the hearts of men until it is too late
to do anything for them than to lament their loss.

Tha army of Sussala was defeated by prince Bhoja,
and he fied from the battle to Lavanotsa. On the other
hand, Bhoja returned from his victory, and snifering
from the hot ‘rays ofsthe sun, sat for a short time with
his father: in' a garden, Ho heard o voice frum the
north side of the palace saying “ the elder son of Malla
has arrived; prepare a bridge,” Dandandyaka had
informed Uchchala that if he did not march that very
day, Sussala would usurp the kingdom. Uchchala came
in hastily, and in the very beginning of the fight killed

_ Devarviyaka, who was stationed befure Charadeva. Naga,
the superintendent of the city, with the royal cavalry
and a large body of infantry went out for battle. He
bad rélied on this superior army in the battle against
Sussola, and he did not now fear to meet Uchchala,
Uehchaia feared Néga, and had a smaller army, bat
Néga, when he approached him, took off his turban and
bowed to him. But Uchchela did not trust him after his
experience of the conduct of the Lord of Mandala, and
told him to retire to his house at Dumba, which Naga
did, Tho fruit of N figa's disaffection was visible in this

country. ‘
On arriving to the river side, the king saw the Démaras
black and disfigured on tho other side of the bridga;
and among them Janakachandra shone in his white
mail, The great bridge of boats which the king had
built for his own purpose, now served the purpose of ,his
foes, The king was disgusted with the people, and éalmly
saw the battle with his relatives on the other side of the
bridge. On the other hand, the daughter of Shéhi aud
other queens intendod to perish 4n the flames, and took
some fire with them, and ascended a house which had
® hundred doors. As the King’s party was unable to
overcome the opponents, the ladies were preparing to
light the fire, when the king forbade them to commit
suicide by fire, and went to the other side of the bridge
to join the battle. Janakachandra and his men drove
by their arrows the royal olephant which was au the |
front of the bridge. The benst, struck by arrows in
a mortal part, retreated, vomiting and bredthing herd
and treading on the king’s soldiers. This unfoftunate
accident caused numerous deaths among the cavalry and
infantry of the royalists. Repulsed by the enemy, the
king recrossed the bridge and entered the palace with a
hundred doors. The king, who had never been deen
even in privacy without garments, who even at the time
of taking his meals did not cast away the signs of
reyalty, was now seen perspiring from feax ond from

+ his shoulders, and as oftou replaced, Through his rest-
lessness, the whip struck tho horse and made tho animal
run, the reins fell from his hand, aud were taken up and
pulled again. His hair fell to his shonlders, and he drew
them round his ears, which looked like caverns surround-
ed by black serpents}; and the sword dropped from his
hond,* There were no ornaments in his cars, his red lips
were pale and dried for want of betel, and he was fre-
quently licking it with his tongue. Thera was dust in
his eyos, whiod disfigured his face and made it pale,
He was looking on his queens behind him, and moving
about in the courtyard, and with his hand forbidding
his queens to light the pile which they were ready to do,
Thora was a house of Mallargja near the oapital,
Janakachandra set fire to this after crossing the river.
On seeing the flame approaching towards the capital,
Bhoje, thought the kingdom was lost, and fled. He rode
out of the courtyard through the gate, pierced with the
great lances of the enemies. , With five or six horsemen
he weht towards Lohara, and crossing the bridge, arriv-
ed before the Matha of Sinharaja. The king gazed with
tearful: eyes on the’ direation in which his son had dis-
appeared, and with horsemen went round and round the
, bofise, In order to save some of the queens who in the
meantime were intending to commit suicide, the king's
men attempted to break in into the rectangular building.
The daughters of Shéhi, believing that the enemies had

and set it on fire, .
At this time the Daémaras who dwelt there, armed
themselves and hurt one another, and plundered the
palace with a hundred doors which was now on fire. In
doing so, some died, some endangered their lives, and
some got things they had never seen before, and became
the objects of ridicule, Some took @ mouthful of cam.
phor, considering it to be white sugary, and burnt his
mouth, and threw the potinto the river. Some took
gold-colored pictures, and tho buynt clothes and ashes
of varingated hues, belioving them to be geld. Somo
Démora women thinking the pearls in which no holes
had been made to be rice, pounded them in mills,
Fortune now left the kingdom, The beautiful and well-
dressed females of the king were seen at every step to be
captured by the cruel Daémoras. Vasontalekh4 and
other sixteen queens, together with the wives of their
sons, perished in the flames. The bursting ‘sounds of
the burning houses wero heard like the roaridgs of the
summer clouds on the sea. The king saw these things
from the side of Shriprdmashif, o place for the distribu-
tion of water, and often and often repented the line com-
posed by the Rishis, “The fire that rises for oppressing
the subjects is not quonched till it has burnt the kiig’s

‘battle, a wish worthy of his family, but was swayed
every moment by the wavering opinions of the infantry.
The king was going to battle through the advice of
Anantap4la and other Rajpocts, but was remonstrated
by Dandanéyaka at every step. Champaka advised
the King either to go fo battle or to Lohara, and the latter
atep was deemed better by Prayéga. But the king, not
having heard anything of his son, became anxious, and
ordered Champaka to follow the footsteps of prince
Bhojadeva. Obhmpake,aighed and said, “ You will soon
bo loft alone with Prayéga, 80 do not send me away.”
And the king replied to him with tears in his eyes, that,
“they gay you never rebelled, thon wherefore do you
disobey my orders now, Though the sun shines, I cannot
see anything without my son, so you cannot be angry
when he shall embrace me. Even in these days there is
_differegce without cause between the prince and the
minister."- Thus rebuked by his master, Champaka,
abashed ani with downcast face, set out after the prince.
Of hig horsemen and followers aud hig brothers, fifty in
all, who set out with him, only five were left, including
himself-when he ordssed tha river. Not getting any
news of the prince, he arrived in the evening af tha
junttion of the Vitast4 and the Sindhu. The king sent
other faithful men in search of his sop, while mure uf
his people, on the pretence of searching for the prince,
deserted him.

Dandangyake was now the king’s advisor—the snme
moon who had taken bribe in the wars with Rajapurf, &.,
who had employed unworthy servants, who was the
cause of the royal army being destroyed by fire, who
had opposed the prince when ho was going to Lohara,
and who, when the king was busy in some other battle,
had admitted the enemy into the city. Harsha, weak;
and listening to various advices, could not determine
what to do. As the pipe will not sound if one breathes
through all the holes, evon so the king could not come
to any determination from tke several advices he
received. When even low people insolently offer advice,
though unasked, according to their judgment it is a
certain sign of the loss of fortune’s favor. The chariot-
eer, named Troilokya, who was speaking to Dandanfyaka,
pulled the reins of his horse and said to the king: “On
former days your grandfather conquered with the help
of the Ekinngas, fighting side by side with the ccvalry. .
So let us go near Akshapatala to collect a similar army ;
then falling on them we shall destroy the enemy whose
army is mostly composed of infantry.” But when he
consented to move towards that,place, his army scat-
tered itself on all directions, as the ‘crowd which Gomes to
a theatre does when overtaken by rain. The king
gave the jewelled ornaments of his neck to the Rajpoots,
whom he found on the other side of the Vitasté, to defray
the expenses of his son on the road. When these ensigns
of royalty were given to his followers, the king looked

KINGS OF KAsHMRA, 298

shorn 9f his glories. The number of his soldiers
> diminished at every step; and when he arrived at Aksha-
patala, there was none to attend him. Tho king felt
suspicious, and in the evening went round the houses of
the ministers ; he waited at thdir doors, but none allowed
him entrance. The false friends of the king did not
‘help him in this ast extremity. After passing by the
hottses of all for help, he entered the house of the minis-
ter Kapila, At that time Kapila was at Lohara, but his
wife was willing fo give him shelter, and afterwards to
seud him by *boat to the fort of Lobara, But the king
was bewildertd, and did not accopé the offer.

The king’s sons who had rebelled against him as ho
did against his father, hid themselves from him as bank-
rupis hide from those who lead. The king now camo
to know that he had done many things wrong by hearing
himeelf ill spoken of. Previous to this the ministers
used,to hide many things from him. Having lost hope
in every thing, and mistrusting those around him, he
passed with a small retinug to Pradyumos. When the
darkwess deepened and it deepened at every step, the
horses stopped. At this time the proud Rajpoots,
Anantspdla and otifers, who counted their dynasties
thirty-six generations back, deserted him. When tho
king arrived before the temple of Johila, he descended
from his horse, and Dandanéyaka and the king’s younger
brother now deserted him. His younger brother left
him on the pretence that there was his father-in-law's
house in the neighbourhood, and that he would return

after paying 2 visit. Prayéga asked the king’s younger
brother something for the king’s food, and he gave him |
an ornament, but not saktu (powdered oats).

The king, whose life was nearly at its end, was shorn
of his glories, and had oly one piece of cloth to wear,
and had Pray4ga for his only follower. One Mukta, cook
of Jelaka, who was a servant of Champaka, now came te
the king, and was received into his confidence. gWhen
they were wandering about, a woman from a cavern
jn arock told them that the land before them wea not
passable, owing to the canals being cut,for the supply
of water. And when they had geated by, the Vitasta,
Prayéga onllod for the boatmen, in order to go to
Jayapura fort, Prayaga made an agreement with the
armed mon who were in the neighbourhood to take them
to the house of Bhimaideva, where the king wished to
go. Bhimddeya was a partisan of Uchchala, but had
said that -he would follow the king if the king would
come to his house, When the boat was brought in Sy the -
boatmen, the timid king who was hurrying to destruction
would not get into it, At the time of destructign, the
light of man’s intellect fails and leads him to death,
In this time of rebellion the proud-Vimba, of Nilashvfya
who, like ladies of the zenana, would not even "look on
others, with his friendly followers instead of joining the
Démaros went to the king who was looking out for help.

The rainy sensou now set in as if to wash the world
guilty of rebellion; what did not the king suffer then?
The earth seemed without men, the rains darkened all

aides, and he was without help and in fear of the enemy.
For the interests of history, I must name those who
"should have been forgotten on account of their wicked
acts. Within the foxests of Pitrivana there ere some
revered gods who were named Someshvara; they
belonged to Somgnanda, the Siddha. ‘There in the
garden shaded by tho trees was a cot of Shiuna, an insig-
nifeayt hermit, He, with prostitute named Dhish-
ohé, generally known as Virahabhujangef, led the life
of a procarer. The king was then near tho temple of
Pratépagaurishg, and was brought here by Mukts who
considered it 40 be a place for holy mon to live. Mukta
led the way, the king followed him, and Praygya went
last ; and thus they wont by the fitful light of the light-
ning. The king reached the cottage led by Mukta ond
Prayéga, without turban, woaring a sewed piece of cloth,
and sinking down with fatigue. Ile was grieved as he
remembered the hero Kandarps who was driven out by
- his evil ministers, and who could have extricated him
from his present danger ; he grieved even as Utpala had
grieved when he thought of the Daityo. Mukta entered
the cottage by scaling the wall, and then opened the
door and the king entsred the yard, but the hermit was
not there. When the king was coming iv, hia right
foot, was cut by a stone and bled, and he knew by that
bad omen that his death was nigh. The cottage roam
was: barred, so that the king. passed the dreadful aud,
cloudy night in the yard, He passed the night sitting on

a muddy place which was prepafed for saoréfice, and
besmeared with mud, and covered with a servant's,
blanket. His cares made him sleepless, though much
of his grief was allayed while he was nodding in sleep,
‘Who am I? Who hds conquered me? Whore am I
to-day? Who is my follower? What should now be done?”
Thus he thought and trembled avery moment. “My
kingdom is snatched away, my wives are burnt, tf son
separated from me, myself alone and without friends,
‘without provisions for the road, and rolling in the yard of
a beggar?’ Thus thinking of his misf¢rtunes, he could
not find an instance, even in history, of sperson whose
end was as miserable as his own,

On the other hand, prince Bhoja reached Hastikarna
with two or three horsemen, While thus travelling, he
fancied that the kingdom would be theirs again in five
or six days, even if Indra were their enemy. What
does not a man, when excited by his valor, propose to do?
But fortune mars all, He waited at Ranggavdta for his*
servant Nageshvara, to whom his mother gare provision
for the journey. Hearing of his servant’s approach, he
issned from the empty temple where he was living,
suspecting nothing; but he wasvattacked by the repels.
‘When the treason was discovered, the prince, true to his
Kshetriyn caste, displayed wonderful feats of bravery.
After killing his enemies in battle, like a lion, he died
the death of a hero, besmeared with blood. Padmé, son
of his maternal uncle, and possessed of great valor, fell
overwhelmed with numbers,

At night Uohchala entered the monastery of queen
*Surjjamati, His brother, too, tirod of war, came from
Lavanotsa, Hearing that prince Bhoja was dead, and
Harsha alone was living, they felt as if a pale had beon
withdrawn from their mind, and only the point of a sword
yas left there.

Qn the morning Mukta sought out the hermit, who
entered the cottage and bowed to the king and unbarred
the door of his rqom. The king and Mukta entered the
room which was full of gnais, and there was spread o
grass mat, and the floor was sprinkled with water. He,
whose words” bestowed honor on kings before, now fiat-
tered a beggar through fear. The king was pained ab
the shameful words and behaviour of the beggar when
requested for some beggarly food. Prayéva gave the
hermit his wearing sheet to sell, and sent him to o shop
to buy food with its proceeds. This man, with his rude

, Sud indecent words, was o cause of uneasiness to the king,
and the king feared he would be betrayed. At midday
the begga? returned with a. female hermit, on whose
shouldér he had placed pots containing food. The king,
finding himself seen by the woman, despnired of his life,
Oppress#d by grief, hé, at the request of Praysga, merely
touched the food presented to him by Prayaéga, bat did
not eat it. Prayéga asked for news of the famale hermit,
who lived in village, whereupon she told him of the
death of Bhoja. Praydga said that it was s lie, but tha
king believed the painful news, He had fallon in

battle, behaving as heroes covet to do at the timeof their
death, but the king through the excess of his grief la-
mented as if he had died on his lap. Tle saw in his own
person the necklaces which should havo adorned his
youthful son, and became afflicted. Ie was ashamed to
think that his boy, whom he should have protected,
had died in that way, while he was saving his life by. un-
worthy means.

Thus oppressed with unspeakable grief for, his son,
he spent the second night in the house of tho hermit.
PraySga asked the king to go to Bhagd¥anmatha, but
that night he was unable through grief to think of it
The night having the moon for its face seemed to moan;
and it seemed to cry in the cries of Chakravdka, and to
weap in heavy dews. On the morning Prayaga saw his
master hungry snd thirsty, and asked the hermit for
breakfast. The hermit went out and brought two plates
full of rice and curry, He said that he had stolen those
two plates from a religious feast of a houscholder, on
which Praydga sighed and,said :—“ See, O kitg ! see the
yejoicings of the people on your dethronement.” The
king siniling replied :—‘* Why do you talk like a fool?
Ho who is gone is gone; his loss dogs not orente sloss. to
other people. All seak for their own pleasure; no one
grieves for others, When the sun, which is like the duly
eye of the earth, sets, the people sleep at aase. Who
ever deprives himself of rest on account of his separation
from the sun, Having heard of tho death ‘of My BOY,

who wat’ the life of my life, I sit here apparently at ease.
“Why then blame others?’ When the king had said so,
Prayiga rejected the two plates already brought and
again privately sent the hermit to prepare food, Tho
hermit said that what remained of the proceeds of the
sale of the sheet, after defraying the expenses of the
previous day, would hardly suffice to pay him, still he
would by. Thus saying he went out as if grieved.
Men of, poor worth cannot keep a secret; they can
digest Amrita as little as mercury. Manoratha, the
friend and adviser of the hermit, came to know of these
things. He tempted the hermit and seid that they
would get riches if they discovored the king to his
enemies. Manoratha was born of some low caste ser-
vent, for good or bad works of a man indicate lis birth,
Iitér4ja heard from them of Harshe’s whereabouts
and informed Uchchala of it, and Uchebalo | seut hic

of the Kayastha caste, was the cause of the hermit ond
his friend ‘poing to Tltér4jo.- If it be true, as many
have heard, that this servant (Bbiribhisheha) soted
treacherously, then the various insults that he was
subsequently subjected to (making him ride on the
shoulder of a Chand4la who eats the flesh of dog, and
his death in prison) wore all well deserved.
On the other hand, Harsha, being excessively hungry,
and being repeatedly asked by Preyiga, thought of tak
ing some food in spite of his grief for his son. Bxpecting

quently looked out like young birds from the neat. They
noon saw the cottage surrounded by armed men, and heard
the noise made on the bars of the door at the courtyard,

They found out their danger, and saw the vile hermit
calling ont from the yard to their onemies to approach
Mukta who was armed. Leaving Mukta, the King opened
the door, and fearlessly took up a light knife which was
nigh, One cruel warrior encased ip mail, and sword
in hand, came to the king puffed up with pride and
conrage. Though the room was small, yet by his skill
the king threw him on the ground, and “through mercy
spared his life. He proudly said even then, that no end
would be gained by destroying that poor fallen man,
Another person, lifting up one end of the roof of tho

-. music, or the sound of the warlike instruments. The

armed Da&maras were entered intdé the room 1oiselessly
as cats to kill ayatin an earthen pot. Another person

entered the room through the roof, killed Praydga,* and

wounded the king in the head and arm; and having

eluded the blow aimed by the king, hastily struck him

out the name of god Mahoshvara, and fell dead on the
ground like a trea severed at its stem. He was a king, but
was killed in the hut like a thief who had fled intoa
room, Never did he look 80 | noble as now, nor were his
faults ever so completely id from view as at this
moment. Possibly, ib was his aversion to war which
alone spoilt the nobility of his soul. Possibly his fault
lay" in being led by the counsel of others, It was the
fault of his ministers which brought on misfortunes.
He died in| the K4shmirian era seventy-seven, on the
fifth day of ‘The bright moon, in the month of Bh&dra,
aged for ty-two years and cight months. Jt was by magic
that this king wishing, like Diryyodhana to destroy his
velatives, caused the extirpation of his own line and
kindred. He was born when the Sun was in the Cancer.
The low ( un-Bréhmanicel ) people severed the head of
their master as of a thief, and sent it to his enemy.
When his head was severed the whole world shook, and
although there were no clouds in the sky, it mined
heavily: They who fixed -the head ona stick and did
other improper acts suffered greatly for those actions.
Tho beheading of kings, even like the destruction of im-
‘ages*of gods, had only recently bean introduced in this
country. Uebchala, through a sense of propriety, re-
Frained from looking on the head when it was sent to
him ; he remained thoughtful for some time, and had it

a thief, should not have received the benefit of funeral

rites without the orders of Uchchala. Deserted by his
servants, his own race extirpated, himself naked, Harsha’s
remains like those of a helpless man were burnt by one
Gouraka, a wood-seller.

This long history of Harsha is as wonderful as Ramé-
yana or MahGvarate. Fortune is restless like the light-
ning in the clouds; and sudden rising brings evil conga
quences in the end. Still the pride of wealth of those
men, whose aspiration is clouded by Agnorancs, is not
assuaged. Though the lato king had many women in
the zenana, none wept for him ;*though he had many
servants, none followed him or retired to the shrines,
It is shameful that men’s minds do not become indiffer-
ent to worldly affairs, and that they themselves do not
retire to forests, after seeing this heartlessness of persona
whose minds sre engrossed in their own pleasures. It
cannot be gqscertained what there was before life began,
nor what will come after death. Between the “two
stages, living beings are suddenly subjected to miseries,
‘and then retire no one knows where, even like'an actor
without head or legs, who acts for a while, and’ then
retires behind the screen.

As the sun leaving the godless peak of the Himélaya
dwells on Sumaru, so the splendour of royalty left
the fallen race of Udayardja and rested on that of Béta-

Gonanda, lived in 653 of the Kali Yuga, hence Kahlana lived in
the year 4,219th of Kali, Again the author says, that he wrote
his book in the Year 1070 of Saka cra ; and we have just seen
that Gonanda lived 3,596 years before Kahlana, hence we
find that Gonands reigned 2,526 years before the Saka era (ag
stated in linc 56), There p-ovailed a peouliar era in Késhmirg
called the Laukika, or the current era, according to which, ag
each century was completed, it was left out of caloulation,
We have the author's statement tha. he was writing on ibs
94th of this era. Deducting 24 from 3,596 we gat 3,572 | from
the time of Gonanda), and this year was therefore the Close of q
century of the Laukika era. Dividing it by 100 wo have 35°72,
i.e, Gonanda was reigning on the 72nd year of the 26th centu
before the current Laukika century in which the histonan
wrote. c
Trom the above, it is easy t¢ fix dates according to the

Tre story of the Brihmana and his Néga wife is thus
yelated: There was a tank in a garden which had clear and
sweet water, and in it livel a Néga, némed Sushravé. Nowa
certain young Bréilmana named Visikha, being weary of long
travelling, once rested in the shade of a tree beside the tank in
the garden. Aud when he was relieved of weariness by the
pleasant air he fetched some water from the tank and was going
to eat oat-flour when he heard the music of smail bells, and saw
two beautiful girls with sweet white eyes dressed in blue were

issuing ov of the grove before him, Their eyes were lined with
4ne lines of collyrium, and the gentle wind was moving like
banners the ends of their garments over their shoulders.
The girls were eating some pulae, The Préhmana stopped taking
his meal out of shame, and was grievad to see creatures 80
beautiful taking such coarse food. xHe therefore invited them
to what be had for meal, and brought them water from the
tank, and expressed his lovo for them at the same time. And
when they had washed their faces and were sented, tha Brhhmana
begeu to fon them with the fan made of leaves, and suid that
it muiat* be in consequence of aome virtuous actions done by
him in times past that he had met them. With the curiosity of
a Brihmana he alsa asked them as to what race they graced by
their birth, aud how caine they to be so hungry that they were
eating such coarng food. One of them replied that they were the

. daughters of Naga Sushravé ond that they saw no reason why
they should nofont coarse food when better food was wanting.
“My name,” continued she, “is Irdvati, and my father intends
to marry me to Vidyddharendra ; and this is my youngest sister
named Chandralekhé.” The Brilmana again asked them the
reagou of their poverty, to which they replied that he might
put that question to their father, for he only knew the cause,
“He will come,” said they, “on the month of Jaishta on the
twelvth dark lunar day, during the festival of Takshakaydtra.
You will be able to know him by his crystal crown, and we
will also bo near him” Thus saying they went awiy.

- Now, when the festival approacher, and the dancers and
singers and spectators gathered, the Brihmana too wandered
about there,drawn by his curiosity, and recoguized the father
of the damsels by the signa they told him. The futher too
had been informed by bis daughters about their meeting
with the Bréhmana, and now came forward to welcome him.
In the course of conversation, the Dréhmanea asked the Nga
the reasofi of his poverty. “The proud and wise man who
has the sense to distinguish right from wrong,” replied the
Néga with a sigh, “awvill rather prvfer to hide his sorrow which
cannot be remedied, than loudly coaplain of if A good man
when he hears of the misery uf others will he sorry if he can-
not remove it. Aun ordinary in places much value on every-
thing Yhat he does, and liments lnndly ut every misfortune

when he has to bear any misfortune, and suggests 1 himself
unfair means to get rid of it, He thinks that his miseries,
will Jas for ever, and grieves from the very bottom of his
heart, and talks loudly of his griof and suffers eternally, Who
can know, however, the sorrow of those who are reserved, if
their children and servants do not grve them out ; but since
mine has been betrayed to you by my girls, I will not hide it
any longer. See if you can do anything to alleviate it, Yon-
dey you seas hermit under the tree, who watches the fields
rich with harvest. It isthrough fear of him that we have
fled. We cannot eat anything of the new harvost be-
cause he eats nothing, so we are wellnigh starved, If
you can do anything to destroy his austerity, and to make
him eat of the new harvest, we know how to reward the
service of him who does us a benefit.” Be it so, said the
Bribmana as he went away, and began to think day and night
as to how he could accomplish the task, 7, ‘

Once when the herinit was sitting while his food was
being cooked, tho Bréhmana stole into the place and dropped
some new rice into the vooking pot. And when ths food was
ready the hermit ate it. Thus relieved of the religious pro-
hibition, the Naga greedily ate of the new fruits which he
brought down from the trees by pelting at them, and his
misery was removal, Hethen invited the Brdéhmana to his
house, and ,told his daughters to entertain the host and bene-
factor. After a few days had passe, the Brihmana expressed
his wish to return home asking at the same time his ‘youngesh
daughter, Chandralekh4, in marriage as the fuvor-he was pro-
mised. Though the parties yere not marringeable (he being
a Bréhmana and she a Ndga girl), the fathor consented, and also
loaded him with riches. He returned to Narapura ‘where he
was passing his days in happiness and mutual affection whan
the event narrated in the text happensd.

though he was master of his passions, was much afflicted to
fearn of his death, and went to that place to perform the last
ceremonies due to the remains of his pupil. Here he found
the body fixed to ihe pale (pike), and reduced to skeleton, the
wolves having devoured the flesh; and the wind was passing
through the hole in his head. Ishina began to weep as he
disengaged the stick from the body; and driving back the
hawlng wolves, he dragged away the corpse from the place ;
the hair of his late pupil covered with dust touched his feet.
But When he was going to perform tho last ceremony, the
following lines marked on bis forehead by Vidh4t& caught his
eye: “ Poverty so lopg as he lives, ten years’ imprisonment,
death on a pale, and then kingdom again.” Seeing that the
firat three lines had agreed with the fact, he became much
anxious to know ‘how the fourth would come to pass. He
“thought that Fade was irresistible, and in spite of every oppo-
sition what was writ by Fate must coma to happen, He re-
collected the history of king Péitha of Maunipura, who, when
killed, was brought back to life by the daughter of a Naga;
and Parikshita when burnt in bis mothers womb by the arrow
of Ashvattham&, was revived by Kiishna, Who but Fate
brought to life again Kacha who was burnt by Daitya, and
the N&gas who were devoured by Gartula? Saying all these to
himself, he watched the skeleton in hope to see it revive again,
Now, at midnight, while he was watching, his thoughts hav-
ing drivch sleep away, he felt the smell of burning incense,
and then he heard the loud sound of drums. Soon after he
saw Yoginisacoming that way with a burning light. ihey

Tur stories that are related of king Meghavahana, aro as
follow :—One day when he was walking, he heard a ory near
him of “thief thief,” and he also beard the voice of weaping.
“ Who is there, kill the thief,’ said the king in anger; after
which the crying ceased, but he saw not the thief, Two or
three days after when he went ont to ride, some two or threa
beautiful women came to him for help. The kind-hearted king
stopped his horse, aud heard what they had tosay. They
made their obeisance and said : “O merciful king! Since thor
hest begun to reigu, who shall fear the oppression of other
men? Once, when the sky was covered with clouds, and the
peasants were afraid of a hail storm and anxious to protect
their fields of ripened corn, they got angry with the Nagas who
wera our husbands and raised the ery of ‘thief.’ You hesed
it and ordered that thy should be killed, and they were bound
with ropes. Now have mercy on vs andon them.™ The king
smiled and ordered them to be released. The Nagas, thus
freed, boweyl to the king and went away wikh their wives. ,

It is related that in an expedition which this king led
against others, he meditated when his soldiers were sleeping
at esse under the Palm trees, how he could conquer the
island before him. While thus thinking, he heard’ a ory
from the seaside forest exclaiming’ Even ‘in the rejga

this the Ting went to tho spot taking with him an um-
Wrella; and there he saw a hunter chief killing a man
before the temple of Chandi. “Tie to your wicked act,” said
the king to the hunter, “ you do not know what may betide
you,” ha hunter became afraid, and replied that his child
was lying on the point of death,’ anda heavenly voice had

_friendalso would die, for the child was the life of all. “You
protect the helpless, and why do you not protect the child
qhose death many will lament.” When the king heard the
words of the? huuter*and looked on the suppliant look of the
man who was boing sacrificed, he thus said “ Hear O! hunter,
Lshall protect botlyyou aud your child and its many friends, as
also this friendleas man. Here I offer myself a sncrifice be-
fore the goddeas, kill me without fear, and let them both live,
Astonished at this great sclf-sacrifice of the king, the hunter
replied “ your mercy, O! king, has got the better of your reason ;
why should you disregard your valnablo life which should be
awed at the cost of the three worlds? Kings should not care
for pride or fame or virtue or wealth or friends or wives or sons
when their own life is in danger, Therefore have no mercy
on this man. If you live, your subjects as well as my son
will live” To this the king who was willing to ofer himself
a secrifieg thus replied: “ What do you know of justice, you
who dwell jn forests; the inhabitants of the deserts know
not the pleasure of bathing in the Ganges. Do you, 0! fool,
oppose my atfémpt to buy immortal glory with this mortal
body? Speak uo more, if you feel hesitation to strike mo, can-

then delivered the umbrella to Varuna, and also offered
prayers to him, and said that “even the kalpa tree was
not equal to good beings. For the tree gave blessings when
asked, while the good gave benelits unasked. If you had not
asked the umbrella for the fenefit of your subjects, but bad
taken it for your own use, your act would not have been
righteous. Charitable men do not favor their dependants by

The visit of Shiva to the king is thus narrated:

At Shri hill the prince met a follower of Shiva named
Ashvapfila, who gave him some roots, &c,, to eat and said that
in a former birth be (Ashvapida) ‘tad attained perfection and
had asked the prince what he wanted, and the prince
had asked to have akingdom. “And when I was thinking as
t» how your desire could be attained, Mahddeva said to me
that,you were his favored follower, and that he would fulfil your
desire, “Thus saying, Mahadeva disappeared.” These words re-
minded the prince of his former life, aud with a desire of
getting the, kingdom, he worshipped Shive for one year, aftor
which period Shiva appeared to him in the form of a hermit,
and promised him to give whatever he wanted. The prince
wanted to be king of the world, “ Wherofore do you ask,”

" questioned the fod in the form of a hormit, “temporary enjoy-
ment instead of salvation.” Tha prince answored, “TI asked you
for the kingdotw believing you to be a false hermit, for surely
you are uot Shiva, the great guru of the world. For the great
give moro than what is asked of them, they will give milk if a
thirsty men aske for water. You cannot know the pain which
I fecl for not getting salvation.” Shiva became glad, and
showed his real person to him and said that “in due courye,
when you will be reigning, Ashvapaida by my ordegs will warn
you of your salvation.” When Shiva disappenred, the prince
tools leave of Ashvapdla and catae to Kdshmira,

The death of king Pravarasena is thus told :

By the erders of Shiva, Ashvapida addressed one Jayanta,
a Késhmirian BiAbmana, saying “I hope you are not weary of
travelling, show this letter to the king.” But the BiAhmana
ee‘d that he was weary of travelling, and could not set aut
that day. Whereupont-Ashvapidta replied that he was a
heimit ofthe clasa that scarried hunwn skulls, and as he had
touched him, he should bathe So sayiny he pushed the Biihmana
intoapond. Risingfrom the water, when Jayonta opevet hia
eyes, he saw himself in his native country, and the servants of
the king busy in fetching water froma the river for tle king to
worship. Jayanta found opportutity to put the billet hastily

royal presents, The contents of the letter were as follow —,
“You have done what should have been done, you have given
large gifts, and enjoyed what should have been enjoyed, your
year's are on the decline, what moro shall you do? Come to the
house of Shiva.” The king ascended the heaven piercing
through the stony house and the people saw him going towards
Kaildsa across the clear sky, like another sun. ‘The king
reached the court of Shive in his human body. Even to the
day may be seen ihe passage throngh which the king made, hia

The selection of the spot for the construction of the new
city is thus narrated :—

One night the king set out in order to ascertain the best
place and time to build his city. The stars were reflected on
the jewels of his crown, and looked like mustard kept for
charming away evil spirits. Ho then saw on the banks of a
river the trees lighted up by the light of the burning dead ;
and on the other side of the river he saw a gigantic Rakshasa
with hands uplifted and making a hedious yell. The fiery
glance of the Rakshasa fell on hin which made him turn pale ;”
while the being filled the air with yells, and laughing aloud,
said “If you and Vikramddéitya and Shidrala “ve excepted,
patience exists not in this earth. I will O king ! falfil your
vesire, so cross the bridge and come over to my side.” So
saying he stretched his leg and made a bridge of it over tiv
river. Seeing the bridge made of his timb, the king,drew out
his knife, and having cut out sont flesh he made something
like steps. The place where he orossed is still called Kshu-
yikAvéla. When the king had gone over tothe other side, the
Rékshasa advised him to build the city where in the morning
the king would see a thread spread by him, and then dis-
- appeared. In the villngs of Shfuitaka the seat of Yakshp’ Atta

and the goddess Sh&riké, the king found the thread left by the
R&kshasa.

Here is an account of the lives of this king and queen on
their provious birthy :—

The king in his former life was a dice-player; ho lost
everything in the play, and become indifferent to worldly life.
He then wished to commit suicide. Thus dice-players are
never satisfied till they have lost everything, But then he

lt a desire to see the goddess Bhramaravdsint who was in
the Vindhyé hills, though the attempt might cost him his life,
ands got her blessing. For five yoyanas round the place
where the goddess resided, the black hees used to sting those
who approached, and ao mate the place inaccessible, But the
dice-playor "thought" light of the danger, for life he thought
way trausient, He first covered himself with mail, then
with buffalo hidd, and ‘hen with clay and dung. She sun
* dried up the clay, which gave him poin, and ha looked like a
moving brick. Despniring of lifu ho left the direct way and
went through deep dark caverns, The noise of the black bees
which deafened the ear, rose like the sound of death. The
fluat that rose from the frst layer of clay blinded their
eyes, and though they stung, yout they could not oppose
him. They rotirad for o time, but after the pilgrim had
proceeded three yoyanas, tho firat layer of clay wasall rub-
bed away. Then the bees fell on the buffalo hide, aud
made a loud “chata-chaté” sound, Whon he had proceaded half
a yoyans more, he knew by the “rana-rand? sound that the
bees had fallen on his iron mail. He then began to run fast,
but the iron paver was cut by the bees and fell off from his
bady, but still he did not losa patience. When the house
of the gétldess was yet two krosbas distant, he began to run
giving the black bees with his hands. Whon he reached
er house, only bones and small blood-vessels were left, his
flesh being torn off; aid, his eyes were protected with his
hauds. Then the bees ceased to sting, he looked round, and
fell almost dead at, the fect of the goddess, The goddess
touched him with her hand and revived him, and renewed
his body and made it good. Me soon revived by the touch
of the heavenly hand and looked round, but saw not the awful
figure*of the goddess seated on the lion that he had seen
" when he had entered the room. But he saw a young womau

by the side of a tank in the midat ef a garden. Hor neck-
lace was flowing over her swelling bosom, her smali feet were
dyed red, and her lips were of the wune color. Her hair was”
black, and moon-like was her face, and small was her waist,
Finding her so lovely and aloue, he felt a passion for hor, and
thought her to be an Apsaré, The girl then addressed him
with kindness “ you have suffered weariness in your way, O!
beautiful, rest yourself and ask for blessing.” “ My weariness
is gone,” replied he, “at your sight, and how can I ask you for
blessing, you ara not the goddess.” “ How you are mistaken”
exclaimed she, “be [ geildess or not I can bestow favor on.fou.”
When she promised that she would give him whatever he
might ask for, he disrespectfully asked permission ito be fami-
liar with her. “How evil-minded you are)*she excl&imed, “ask
for any thing else, for I am the goddess Bhramaravasin{,”
Even when he know her to be the goddess, hiscuind would not
bo calm, for who can oppose desires even to the next life, ,
He said that if she wished to redeem her promise, sho must
graut what he had asked fur, for he wished for nothing else.
“Not the least part of that,” continued he, “ which is fixed by
Sate is left undone, Be you goddess or be you the wife of
Shiva, be you hedious or lovely, I see in you the same being
that I saw before.” Seeing him fixed in his determination,
she said that his desire would be fulfilled in his next birth,
“Heavenly beings do not wish to cohabit with mortals, so
begone,” she said aud disappeared. He then went to Praydga,
and fall from the Vata tree ; his soul left his body, wishing in
the last moment that the words of the gaidess might be ful-”
filled, He then became Randdityn, and tho goddess became
Ravarambb4 in their next births, and they did rot forget the
history of their past births, °

APPENDIX H.

The following story is related of the two images mentioned
in ihe text —

On the day following, when the ceremony of invoking the
divine spirit into the images was about to be commenged, an
astrologer from a foreign country found fault with the ‘mages
as they were filled with frogs and stones inside. And when

the king was moditating as to what to do, his goddess queen
said to fim that when the daughter of Himdleya was being
~married to Shiva, Brahm4 who served as priest worshipped
Vishnu. But since it was as useless to worship Vishnu alone as
to worship Sakti without Linga, he mado a Linga also. These
images of Vishnu and Linga were then taken from Brahmd
by Révana and were worshipped av Lank&, and were kept there
for along time, But after Kavana’s death, the monkeys took
possession of thom, and not knowing their value, threw them
izto the lake Manasa, * From that lake, I have caused them
to te, taken out, and you shall seo them to-morrow morning.”
She ther? went into her apartment, and through her invisible
agents, oaused them to be got out of the lake, and the king
to his greab surpriss saw them in the morning. Suddenly an-
other image of Shiva, named Ranasv4mi, aroso from the carth
ponetrating the ground, and then ascended to the heaven un-
perceived. Some say, however, that it was seen by all men,
In honor of this god, the quoen made the holy Siddha versed
in Vedas perform many religious ceremonies. Before god
Pradyumna, the king aud the queen raised two images of
Shiva, named Ranérambhasvéum{, and built 2 house for Shaivas.

APPENDIX I.

Once upon a time a Bréhmana woman appeared in the
court, an®, when asked by a Justice as to the reason of her com-
ing, replied to the king that her husband had been murdered,
while the pugisher of the wicked still reigned. It was a shame
toa holy king that an untimely death should overtake his
subjoct. * If you attribute it to Kali yuga,” she continued,
et you should uot be indifferent to such a heinous crime.
Tdo not remember that my husband had quarrels with any
one. He was neither envioys, nor arrogant, nor avaricious, but
of sweet words, and spoke with every one, nor did he bear
malice to any.” Shethen said, that she suspected one Bréh-
mana Who lived near Mik hikesvimi, who way of the same age
with her husband, and was his fellow-student, though inferior
to himjn learning, and who knew magic. © The iguorant and
the low,’ she suid, “oppose out of envy the doings of the
“great, in order t> dim their reputation. THe who frequents not

the house of prostitutes is vot a bad character, he who injures
not others, does uot remain in constant fear, he who%alks not
much, sperketh no lie, he who is nob a Ké4yastha, is not uu-.
grateful, he who is not born in tho house of a bountiful man,
is not avaricious, he who is not envious is not over unhappy,
he who is not henpecked is not laughed at, he who is not ald,
speaks not politely, he whoria not illegitimale, docs not blame
his father, he who 1s not in love is not bashful, he who is not
half-educated is not vicious. This is the tue saying.” When
she had said thus, the king ordered the suspected Brdbmazg
to be brought and to be exninined by ordeal, Whereupoy the
Bribmana woman again said “O king! he kuows magit, and
oan remain undor water, so that examination by ordeal will
be useless for Inm.” “How can we act,” replied the king,
“against law, when the clime iy not proved, pumshment ean-
not be awarded to avy one, far less toa Bréhmana, who, even
when guilty, cannot be killed.” But the Bréhmana woman
said thut she hal taken food for four night, and had not *
followed her husband to the other world, only to have that
etiminal punished; and if he was not punished, she would
starve herself to death.

When the Brétmana woman remained without food, the
king also remained in the same state, trusting on the god
Tribhuvanasviii. Wheu three nights were thus passed, at
about dawn, tho king learnt the truth from Tribhuvanasvémi in
a drew. “You should not,” said the god, “thus seek for
ilivine revefation in Kali yuga, for who can biing the sun
in the middle of the night? But only ou account™ of yous
virtues, you will be favored with the revelation’ for once.
Scatter in the yard of my tousple the powdered dust of shili
grain, and let evary one go round over it, aud then you will
be able tp know the murderer by his foot-marks wWaich will
be like those of the Brihmana-slayer, and he should dg
punished. Do this dpring uight, for i, the day time the sun
eliminates sins.” ‘The king, accordingly, found out the orimi-
nal and punished him, though he did not kill him fur he was
a Brébmana. When the man was punished, the woman blessed
the king, and said that of all kings he and Kértaviryya alone
had punished offenders for sins dove in secret. *¢ While you

reign, O king! who can live without feeling for you Igye or
friendship,” f

. The king was greater than Indra, his orders were not
slighted even by gods. Once, for instance, when he was en-
camping with his army on ihe shores of tho Eastern Sea
(Bay of Bengal), he ordered for a Kapittha fruit, and his men
knew not wheuce to bring it. Buta being from heaven brought
the thing to him. The king accopted ithe present and made
& sign to his sentinel 1o ask who ha was. The person replied
‘hat he way the gardeper of Indra, and had been scnt by his
magter, and that ho had some message to deliver in private.
The Sentinel, accordingly, removed other men from the
king’s presence, Ue then said that Indra had sent him a
message which, though harsh, was intended for his good, and
which he would havé the goodness to forgive. “ Hear, O king 1”
continued the messenger of Indra, “why even in Kali yuga,
your words has heen qbeyed by gods. In your previous life,
you were employed by a rich villager to till his grounds.
Que suiomor day, you were driving your bullocks in a wood
where there was 10 water, and in the evening, when you were
tired with the day’s work, somo one brought to you cake and
water from your master's house, But when, after washing your
handy and feet, you were going to eat, you saw a Brahmans
dying of hunger. He forbade you to eat, since he was dying
of starvation ; and, though the man who brought to you your
food advised you not to give it to the Urahmane, yet you
gladly gave him half of the cake and water, sweetening your
» offer wth kind words. And for that timely gift the gods uno-
dertook to obay one hundred of your onters, It is for this
that rivers of pure water have flowed at your bidding in the
sandy desert. Thongh the gift De small, yet, when given in
good sffirit and with kind words, and to a deyerving person, is
gevore benelicial than Kalpa tree. But with indixeretion you have
wellnigh spent the stack of one hundred orders, and there
are. onlyza few remaiding. Being a wise man, why have you
lost your discretion like an ordinary king? How can the fruit
that grows in Késhmfra in the rainy season be had in winter
in the shores of the Eastern Sea? That the gods obey you
wherever you may be, is owing to the gift you made in
your former life. Now, in the East, Indra obeys you with
relucsance, you having come nearly to the end of your stock 7

of orders, Do not give such ordevs unless in emaorgency, for
there are only a few remaining which will be obey di.” The
king bacame astonished to learn the valuo of gifts, and to ob-.
tuin such bonefits again, he caused = permanent asylum for
the poor to be built at, Parihasapura; and to this asylum he
preseuted one lac and one plates with food, And for the same
reason, he also caused a cityeto be constructed in a barren
place, that thirsty men might find water there,

APPENDIX K

The following is the story told of the niystariou§ jewels;
Changkuna used to augment gold in the king’s treasury by
magic, In Pangehanada at the confluence” of the rivers
the king was once detained with his army rbeing unable
to crogs over, and consulted with his minister as to the means
of crossing. At this time Changkuna threw a jewel into
the deep river, which divided the waters into two parts, and
when the king and his army had crossed tho river to the other
side, the magician drew out his talisman by another jewel,
aud the waters flowed as before. Astonished at this, the king
praised him and asked for those two jewels. Changkuna
smiled and anid that they were fit for himself but were un-
worthy of the king, A good thing is admired when among
common things aud not when it is with other good ethings. ,
The moon-stone which perspires in the mooulight is At to be
seen at the sou-shore and not when it is underthe sea (its

" moisture being then lost in the sea water). The fing smiled
and asked what better jewels he possessed. “Give me those,”
he continued, “ in exchange of what you think to be more pr
cious, or of whatever I have in my treagury.” “ This is » grea
boon,” said Changkuna;’“ oblige me by grving what I desire, the
statue of Buddha which you brough$ on elephant from Maga-
dhe. Take the jewels that will carry thee safe through the
waters, and give me that which will carry me safe through this
world.” The king made the exchange,

The discovery of the copper ore is thus related :—

One day tho king saw in a vision a heavenly person who
told him “1 am Mohapadma, king of the Négas. I am happy
in your friendship and live in yanr kingdom, and now I come
to ask you for protection. A charmer from Drfvira wants to
capture me and sell me to the people of a desert where they
ave hankering after watgr. If you can protect me from him,
T shall show you a hill where gold can be found.” The king
heardthese words in dream, and caused the charmer to be
brought and asked him his purpose, assuring him at the same
time of his safety. The charmer confessed to him all that the
king had Reard in*his dream, whereupon the king wondered,
and again asked him as to how he could take out the serpent
from the lake ®hich exfended over several yojanas. “O

” king!” repliedetha charmer, “the powers of magic ara beyond
thought, and if you want to see it, come quickly.” Tho king
thon followed him to tho lake which the magician dried up by
his arrow discharged with spells. The king then saw in the
mul, surrounded by numerous other serpents, a snake having
the face of man, and aspan in length. “I have shortened him
by my spells,” said the charmer, “and I capture him now.”
But the king forbade him to capture the king of the snakes,
The magician obeyed the king,and made the luke full of
water as it was before, The king dismissed the Drévarian
with gifts of money, and wondered the serpent did not
show hin. the promised hill where gold was to be found.
When he thought thus, the serpent appeared to him ina
dream, and asked him, “For what benefit shall I show you
the gold& mount? It is through the chance of birth that

e country is our native land, and another foreign, there is
no real difference between them. For fear of humiliation
I asked y=ur protection; but you subjected me to that humi-
liation. What is more humiliating than to be insulted before
those whom I protect? How shall 1 see the faces of my
females who found me unable to save them from the power
of another? You and myself are born of the same source,
but for your pastime we were insulted. Those who are
blind with their prosperity and heedless in their action, -

' think that they have done great favors in whatever they


--- Page 330 ---
xvi

do. Kings deem it but play to igsulé others, but those
who are insulted, think themselves as dead as lon as they
breathe. Kings slight the honor of other people when it comes:
in contact with their interest, but great men try to preserve
their honor even at the sacrifico of fe, How can they under-
stand what honor is, who insult the prond. Still however your
expectations from me will uet be ultagether disappointed, for
I shall show you the lull where there is copper ore.” Then
he gave such directions in dream a3 euabled the king, when he
rose in the morning, to discover the bill vith copper ore.
