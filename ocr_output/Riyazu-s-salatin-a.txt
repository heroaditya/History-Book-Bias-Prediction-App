And now sgall India’s paroquets on sugar revel all,
In this aweet Persian sugarcandy that-is borne to far Bengal ”
Hafiz to Sultan @hiaso-d-din, King of Bengal.

‘he History of Bengal cannot fail to be of special interest
not only to Hindus and Muss]mans in Bengal, but also to
Englishmen, in that Bengal formed the foundation-stone of
the glorious fabric of Empiré in Asia that England was des-
tined in subsequent years to rear on the wreck of the mighty
Empire of the -Great Mogul.’ Yet Histories of Bengal are
very faw. From the Muhaanmadan side, though there are plenty
of Genetd! Histories of India, hontaining incidental references
to Bengal, or dealing with particular periods of it, there is no:
general or comprehensive History of Bengal, save and except
the Kiydzus Salitin. From tha European side, the only
standard History of Bengalis Stewart’s History, but this last,
too whilst mainly based on the Riyaz, incorporates also the
less reliable accounts from Ferishta. To appreciate the his-
torical value. and position of the.Riyaz I need only quote the
opinions of two eminent Orientalists. “The Riyagu-s-Salatin,”
says the late Professor Blochmann who laboured so largely
fot the Asiatic Society of B Bengal, “ig much prized as being
the fullest account in Persian of the Muhammadan History of
Bengal, which the author brings down to his own time (1786-
88)"; whilst Dr. Hoernle observes in a letter tome: “The
Riyaz is a Standard History of Bengal, is continaally quoted
by Mr. Blochmann in his ‘Contributions to the History and
Geography of Bengal’ in the Journals of the Asiatic Society
Mr. Blochmann strongly recommended that it should be
translated, and, therefore, the hook is one which deserves
being translated and published by the Asiatic Society.”

Whilst fully sensible of the honour conferred upon me by

the Asiatic Society in entrusting to me the duty of transla-
ting wrth notes this Standard History of Bongal, I can.
not help confessing to a sense of diffidence in presenting
this volume to the public under their auspices. Circumstan-
ees over which I have had little contro}, snch as domestic
troubles, difficulties of access to libraries or books of refer-
ence 'n out of-the-way mofussil stations, and sognty snatches
of leisure after by no means light daily official duties—have
combined not only to retard the publication of this annotated
trarslation, bot to interfere with my presenting it in the
shape that Lhad fondly aimedat. Asit is, I venture to think,
whilst fully conscious of its defects and flaws, that I have
spared no pains to render the translation a faithful and
literal representation of the original, consistently with lucid-
ity and clearness in statement. To constantly ehcidate the
text, I have given ample foot-notes. These foot-notes have
been prepared hy me by reference to original and generally
contemporary Persian sources, and in some cases also embody
results of the labours of European scholars and antiqua-
rians, as well as my own personal observations. The prepara-
tion of these foot-notes has involved considerable research
and entailed much labour.

For my labours, such as they have been, I shall, however,
feel amply rewarded if these pages in any measure contri-
bute to awaken amongst my co-religionists in Bengal an en-
lightened. consciousnes# of their historic past, coupled with ar
earnest longing in the present to avail themselves of the op-
portunity afforded by a progressive and beneficent Govern-
nent for their “uture social and intellectual regeneration ; and
also if they widen the mutual sympathies of the two great
nationahties in Bengal by infusing sentiments of closer and
more cordial comradeship, in that they have been fellow-
travellers over the same tract for many long centuries; and
last, though not least, if they evoke the sympathetic interest
of Englishmen in the fate of a great and historic Community
that preceded them for six centuries in the Government
ot this country

P.8.—I had hoped to add to this work an Appendix deal-
ing with the social, economic and political condition of the
people in Bengal under each period of Moslem Rule; but for
this (though I have collected some materials) at present I com-
mand neither the requisite leisure nor the full critical
apparatus. The foot-notes will, however, 1t 1s hoped, give
the reader some idea of the culture and civilisation that pre-
vailed in Bengal under the Moslems, of their system and
methods of administration, of their policy in addmg to the
physical comforts of the people, and m improving their m-

telleciual, social and ethical ideals.

OF THE

RIYAZU-8-SALATIN OF GHULAM HUSAIN SALIM.

In THE NAME OF WOD, THE KIND AND THE Mercirut!

Worlds of praise are due unto the palace of that World-
Creator, who adorning this world by means of His hand of
perfect power with the ornament of existence, has unfurled the
Standard of Creatorship, and worlds of panegyric befit the shrine
of that Supreme Author who has drawn by means of his brush
of perfect art the portrait of Infe in particoloured lines on the
pages of Oreation. “He (God) is that Wise Sage, who has entrusted
the affairs of the management of the world and the people of
the world and the good and the right guidance of all classes to
the persons of Sovereigns, and who has entrusted into the hands
of authority of Sovereigns of this world, the reins of the opening
and stoppage of the business of divers classes of mankind. He
(God) is that Supreme Ruler of the Universe who, weighing the
opening and stoppage of the affairs of mankind and the good and
bad of Centre-Sitters in the circle of earth, in the: scale of
expediency of the world, has left in every clime and every
country a rolex.

From the Cloud of His bounty, the garden of the world
is green.

From the zephyr of His generosity, the orchard of the
soil is green.

From the Colouring of the painter of His Creation,

Emerald becomes green in the centre of mine.

Praise unto Lord, High is His rank and His praise.

Universal is His bounty and generosity,

All praise is due unto His Beneficence !

And blessings full of white effulgence and sacred benedictions
are due unto all the messengers of the Palace of His bounty, that

special mercy and peace be on him and his descendants, and the
people of his sacred house, and on his successors and all his
companions !

After God’s and the Prophet’s praise,’ this humble servant who
is hopeful of the intercession of the Prophet, namely, Ghulim
Husain, whose title is Salim Zaidpiii,‘ so says that since some
period, according to chances of time, he has been in the service of
Mr. George Udny, who 1s a gentleman of high position and high
rank, of graceful character, of kind heart, mild disposition, praise-
worthy deportment and great generosity, who is the Hatim ® of

Muhammad was the first thing created by God, and that all elae followed,
though the Prophet in bodily form was ushered into existence after all other
prophets.

% This has reference to the tragic martyrdom of Husain and other mem-
bers of the Fataynte family, who were all xmnocent, and whose ancestor the
Prophet was

called hamd in Arabic, and is followed by Na‘t, or praise of the Arabian
Prophet.

his history “ Khorghid Jah3n Numi” of which Mr, Beveridge has published
lately an Analysis in the Journals of the Asatic Society, has some notice of
Gbulim Husain. He states that Ghulim Hussein was of Zaidpir m Ondh,
migrated to Mildah in Bengal, and held the office of Dak Munshi or Post
Master there, under Mr George Udny. Noticing the Charitable Dispensary at
Maldah, abi Bakhsh observes that here used to be the house of Ghulim
Husain, and that in the quarter known as Oak Qurbin Ali is the tomb of
Ghulam Hasan who died in 1288 4 H. or 1817 A.C. The chronogram com-
posed in honour of his memory by his pupil, Abdul Karim, is as, red lo 5 thie

the world of bounty, the Naushirwan ! of the world of Justice, the
Generous man of the age, and who is callous about popularity and
praise—

May God always preserve his good fortune, and advance his
rank, and elevate his position, and double his hfe and dignity !—
and that he has been in the class of his servants, and has ever
been and is still the recipient of ns favours. In short, the
excellencies-abounding and bounties-springing person of that
mine of discernment, is unique and matchless in this age.

He is a paragon of all excellencies,

He is superior to all praise that can be conceived.

He is enlightened, sees through things aright, like old
sages,

But he has the fortune, the age and the rank of manhood.

He weighs his words which are pregnant with meaning,

His two lips, like two palms, at the tame of conversation.

Inasmuch as lis high mind is always pursuant of the study
of histories and travels, and is seeker of all sorts of knowledge
and accomplishments, in the year 1200 AH. corresponding to
1786 A.C., his bent of noble mind turned towards seeking a
knowledge of the lives and careers of past sovereigns and rulers
who tnfurling the standard of sovereignty over Bengal, the
Paradise of Provinces,’ have now passed into the secret 1:egions of
Eternity. Accordingly, the order was given to this man of poor
ability, that whatever he might gather fiom historical works, &e ,
he should compile in smmple language, so that it might be intel-
ligible to all, and might deserve the approval of the elite. This

ignorant man, of limited capacity, deeming the execution of the
order of his master incumbent on himself, being the slave of order,
has placed the finger of consent on the eye, ahd girded up the loin
of effort and venture, collected sentence after sentence from every
source, and for a period of two years has devoted himself to the
compilation and preparation of this history. And after completing
it, he has named 1+ Riyazu-s-Salatin,! according to the date of its
completion. It is hoped that this work may merit the approval of
ali persons of light. It is desired of people conversant with paat
times, that if they detect any mistake or oversight, they will over-
look it, inasmuch as this humble man is not free fiom shortcom-
ings, according to the saying “‘ Man is made up of sins of commis-
sion and omission,” and further, that, according to their capacity,
they will correct the mistakes and defects, and if they cannot do
so, they will be good enough to overlook them

The plan of this work consists of an Introduction and Four
Chapters.

Its arrangement is as follows :—

(a) The Introduction consists of Four Sections.

Section I relates to a description of the state of populousness
of the country of Bengal, and of its boundaries and environs.

Section II relates to a description of certain characteristics of
that country.

p 849). However that may be, Bengal well deserved to be styled “ Jimnat-ul-
bil@d,” or ‘ Paradise of Provinces,’ owing to the fertility of its sol, the richneas
of its produce, and the vastness of its natural resources. During Musalmin
rule, the Province of Bengal yielded the largest revenue to the Delhi Emperors,
and in consequence its Viceroyalty was always coveted by Princes Royal of
Delhi, from so remote a period as the times of Emperors Shamenddin Altamsh
and Ghiasuddin Balban—whose sons in succession ruled over Bengal, not to
speak of later Maghal Princes Royal of Delhi, Under British rale also, Bengal
Proper, moluding Assam, Behar and Oriasa and Chutia Nagpur, forms the
largest Administrative Division of India, contains one-third of the total
population uf British India, and yields a gross revenne of 17 or 18 millions
sterhng, or uae-third of the actual revenues of the Indian Empire. It is
worthy of note that the above expression 18 algo used im Mughal Imperial

of his history, but there is internal evidence to indicate that, besides consult-
ing standard historical works, such as Tabaqat-Nasiri by Minhaj-u-Siraj,
Tarikh-1-Firnz Shahi by Ziauddin Barni and by Sirf) Afif (which contain
references to the history of Bengal only for the period between 1198 to
1388 A.C.) and Tabaqat-i-Akbari by Nizamuddin Ahmad (which contains an
account of Bengal for the period 1888 to 1588), the Badaoni and Akbarnimah
by Abul Faz](forthe period ander Akbar) and other similar standard historical
works on India such as the Tuzuk, the Iqbélnamah, the Padshéhnémah, the
Alamgirnémah, and the Maasv-1-Alamgir?. Salim had recourse also to other less
known historical treatises relating to Bengal which are not perhaps now extant,
and perhaps lay only in MSS. Our author now and then says ‘I have seen in.
a little book,’ and he algo cites a historical compilation by one Haji Maham-
mad of Qandahar, of which no copy seems now to exist. Our author appears
also to have taken considerable pains in deciphering old inscriptions on monu-
ments, mosques, and shrines in Ganr and Panduah—old Musalmin capitals
of Bengal. This feature considerably enhances the value of huis history,
and gives it a superiority over other similar works, and places our author in
the forefront of Bengal antiquarians and researchers. Indesd, Ghulam
Husain is pre-eminently the Historian of Mahammadan Bengal, becanse
other Mohammadan historians before or after him dealt only with certain
periods of Bengal history, whilst our author’s narrative comprises the history
of Bengal from the earliest mythological period to the dawn of British rale,
with a more detailed account of Muhammadan Rulers of Bengal. Stewart’s
History of Bengal 1s to.a great extent based on the ‘ Riyaz’ though Stewart
very often has preferred the less accurate account of the Dakbin historian,
Firishta, who flourished in the seventeenth century. The great Oriental scholar
and antiquarian, Professor Blochmann, in his ‘Contmbutions to the History
and Geography of Bengal’ says: ‘The Riyaz 18 mach prized as being the
fallest account m Persian of the Muhammadan History of Bengal” Profes-
sor Blochmann farther observes “for the early poitions, Ghulim Husain
Salim hag used books which are unknown at present , yet he gives valuable
dates which are often confirmed by collatera] evidence, Salim has also made
a fair use of the antiquities of the Gaur District?

Chapter IiI relates to a description of the careers of the
Nazims! who were appointed to the Nizimat of this country by
the Caghta’i* or Mughal Emperors

Chapter IV consists of two parts -—

Part I being descriptive of the arrival of the Christians, con-
sisting of the Portuguese and the French, &ec., in the Dakhin and

in Bengal.
Part II being descriptive of the domination of the Enghsh

Christians over Bengal and the Dakhin.

other special days and occasions. The recital of the Khutbah after one’s
name and the minting of coins, was regarded by Musalmin sovereigns as
emblems of sovereignty.

1 Navims—

The Nizims were functionanes crested by the Mughal Government
or by Sher Shah (Badaoni, Vol. I, p 368). To each Province or Siibah, the
Mughal Emperors appointed two Principal Heads of administration, one being
the Nizim and the other being the Diwin. The Nazm was the Governor
or Viceroy of the Province, he was the Executive and Military Head of the
Province, and admimtered Criminal Justice; whilst the Diwan, though
independent of the former and directly subordinate ‘to the Delhi Emperor,
held portfolio of the Finance, and was responsible for the revenue admimstra-
tion of the Province, and algo occasionally admmietered Civil Justice. Thus
there were two dependent wheels in the machinery of Provincial adminis-
tration. Under the Nazims, there was a chain of subordinate officials, called
Naib Nazims, Serlashkars, Fanjdars, Kotwils and Thanadars on the executive
side, and under Diwans on the judicial side, were Qazi-ul-Qazzat (Chief
Justice), Qazis, Muftis, Mir Adis, Sadrs premded over by Sadr-i-Sadir, and on
the revenne side were Naib or local Diwans, Amils, Shiqdars, Karkuns,
Qanungos, and Patwaiis. The Judiciary, both Civil and Criminal, were often,
however, independent of both Nizims and Diwins, and sabordmate only to the
Impenal Sadr-1-Sadir or Sadr-i-Knl or Sadr-i-Jahan (or Mimster of Justice)
at Delhi, who was responsible for good conduct to the Mughal Emperor
himself. (See Asn, Vol. II, p. p. 37-49, and do Vol. I, p. 268.)

% Caghtai Khin was a son of Cangiz Khan. Emperor Babar, the founder
of the Mughal dynasty in India, was descended on the mother's side from
a nobler stock, that is, from Caghtai Khiin; hence the Mughal Emperors of
India commonly styled themselves as Caghti: Emperors in preference to
‘Mughal’ Emperors, the term ‘Mughal’ not being so honourable, in accord-
ance with an accepted usage and principle amongst’ Moslema to refe~ back
their lineage to the nobler side, whether paternal or maternal,

INTRODUCTION : CONSISTING OF 4 SECTIONS.

Secrion I. A Desoription or Taz Bounparies anp Environs
or THE Country or Brenear.

Be it known to the way-farers of the climes of travels and
histories that the Sibah! of Bengal is in the second climate.?
From Islamabad, § otherwise known as Chittagong, to Teliagadhi,*
that is, from east to west, the length is 400 Karoh,' and its breadth
from north to south, that is, from the mountains m the north to

1 The name of Sibah originated from the time of Emperor Akbar, who
designated the fiscal areas as follows from the time of the ten-years’ setile-
ment —A Siibah was an aggregate of Sarkars, a Sarkar or Division was
an aggregate of Dastiirs, a Dastiir (which Sir Henry Elliot in bie Glossary
explains ag an abbreviation of Dastiru-l-Aml, corresponding to a district
under a Sarkar) was an aggregate of Parganas or Mahals (used as equivalent
expressions), and a Pargana or Mahal meant a fiscal division, the fiscal unit,
comciding with the dominions of a native chief under the Mughal dynasty.
The words used before Akbar’s time to denote fiscal divisions or tracts of
country larger than the Pargana, were Shaq, Khattah, ‘Arsih, Dayar, Vilayet,
Iqta, Bilad and Mamlakat. Thus in the oarher Musalmin histories before the
end of the fourteenth century, we come across Shaq-1-Sama, Khattah-1-Oudh,
* Arsah-1-Gorakpir, Diyar-: or Valayet-i-Lakbnauti, Vilayet-1-Mean Doab,
Iqta’-i-Kara, Bilad Bang, Mamlakat Lakhnanti. See Hlhot’s Glossary, and Arn,
Vol II, p 115, and Tabaqat-i-Nagin, pp. 148 and 262,

2 The Musalman astronomers and geographers divided the world into seven
parts, to each of which they gave the name of Iqlim or climate —See Ain-1-
Akbari Jarrett’s Trans , Vol III, p. 48.

8 Islamabid or Ohittagong. The district was first conquered by the
Independent Musalmin Kings of Bengal. In 1850 AC., abont whch year
Ibn Batutah was in Chittagong, it belonged to King Fakhruddin of Sunar-
gaon. It was re-conquered in 1665 by the Mughals under Umid Khin who
changed the name of the place to Islimabid durng the rule of Nawab
Shaista Khin, Viceroy of Bengal.—See Blochmann’s contributions to History
and Geography of Bengal and the Alamgin-Namah, p. 940, and the Aim,
Vol. II, p, 125.

% Telhagadhi on Teliagarhi is a pass lying between Rajmahal on the
south, and the Ganges on the north; formerly of strategic 1mportance, as
commanding the approaches to Bengal Proper. The rums of a large stone
fort still exist, through which the E.I Railway passes. See Hunt. Imp.
Gazetteer, Vol. XIII, p. 286 and Atm, Vol 11, p. 116.

5 Karoh or Kos—Ain 16 says.—The Kos was fixed at 100 tanabs, each
consisting of 50 Ilahi gaz or 400 poles (bans), each pole of 124 gaz. Sher
Shah fixed the Kos at 60 jartbs, each of 60 Sikandii gaz: A far sakh is equal to
three Kos.—See Ain-1-Akbart, Vol. Il, p. 414,

Sarkir Madiran,' which is the southern limit of this Siibah, is
200 Karoh. And since in the period of Jalal-uddin Muhammad
Akbar Padshah Ghazi, the Sibah of Orissa was conquered by
Kalapahar*® and annexed to the Empire of the Sovereigns of
Delhi, and made a part of the Sitbah of Bengal, the extent of the
latter Sitbah became extended by 43 karoh in length and by 20
karoh in breadth. In the southern limits of this Sibah is the sea,
and towards its north and east, are high mountains, and on the
west, it adjoms the Sibah of Behar. During the rule of
Emperor Akbar, ‘Isi Khan’ Afghan conquering the eastern
provinces struck coin and recited Khutba in the name of Akbar,
and annexed it to the Siibah of Bengal. There* are twenty-eight

1 Sarkir Madaran extended “in a semi-circle from Nagor in western
Birbhiim over Raniganj along the Damidar to above Bardwan, and from there
over Khandghosh, Jahanabad, Chandrakona (western Hughli district) to
Mandalghat, at the mouth of the Rupnarayan river, and consisted of 16
mahals with s revenue of Rs. 235,085.”"—See Blochmann’s Contributions to
the History and Geography of Bengal and the ds-1-Akbari, Vol II, p. 141.

8 Kilapahir is the fa nous general of the Afghin King of Bengal, Sulai-
man Kararim, and the renowned conqueror of the temple of Jagannath in
Poriin south Orissa Kialapahir was killed by a gun-shot in one of the
fights between Masiim and Qutla of Orissa and ‘Aziz Kokah, which in 990
A.H, took place between Colgong and Gadhi. A detailed description of
Kalipahar’s conquest of Orissa 1s given in the Makhzan-7-Ajghania—Seo Arn,
Vol. I, p 370 and Vol lI, p 128.

8 ‘Isa Khin Afghin flourished mm ‘ Bhati’ in the reign of Daiid, the last
Afghan King of Bengal, and continued as ‘ over-lord’ or ‘ Marzbin-i-Bhati,’
as Abul Fazlin the Ain styles bim, with twelve great Zemindars or prince-
lings (known in those days as Bar’ Bhuiyas) under him, after annexation of
Bengal by Emperor Akbar to the Mughal Empire ‘ Isa’s gad: was known as
Masnad-i-All, the existing Diwan families of Haibatnagar and Jangalbari in
Mymensingh district claim descent from ‘Isa. ‘“ Bhats’ according to Abul
Fazgl extended 400 Kos from east to west, and 300 Kos from north to the
ocean to the south , it thus included the Sundarban and the tracts along the
Megna. Grant defines “Bhati” as mncluding the Sundarban and all the
neighbouring lowlands (even Hiyely) overflooded by the tides. The Musalmin
historians never use the term Sundarban, but give the sea-board from Hijely
to the Megna one name of ‘ Bhat,’ which signifies lowlands overflocded
by tides.—See Arm-1-Akbari, Vol I, p. 842, and J.A.S. No. 3, 1874, and No, 2,
1876 and Atm, Vol, II, p. 117,

*# In the Ain, the Sibah of Bengal is stated to have consisted of 24 Sar-
kars including 787 mahals, and the revenue is stated to have been 69 Krors
84 lakhs 59 thousand and 19 déma, equivalent to Re. 14,961,482-15-7 Its,
standing army, according to the Ain, consisted of 28,880 cavalry, 801,150

Sarkirs with eighty-seven mahals in this Sabah!. In past times,
the fixed revenue of this Sabah was fifty-nine kror eighty-four lak,
fifty-nine thousand and three hundied and nineteen dams, which is
equal to about one kror forty-nine Jak, sixty-one thousand four
hundred and eighty-two rupees and fifteen annas in sicca Rupees
Twenty-three thousand three hundred and thirty cavalry, eight lak

infantry, 1,170 elephants, 4,260 gane, 4,400 boats. Remembering that the
army was not generally paid in coin, but by bestowal of fiefs or military jagirs,
sven at this distance of time, it 18 not difficult to imagine how Bengal was
overrun by colonies of Musalméan feudal barons —See Ain-1-Akbaui, Vol. II,
Pp 129 and Vol, I, p. 370.

1On tne Prontiexgs or MoHAMMADAN Brnean.

The text as well as the Akbarnamah and the Iqbalnamah-1-Jahangiri state
that Bengul was bounded on the south by the sea, on the noith by hills (that
as, those south of Nepaul, Sikkim, and Bhutan), on the east by hills (that is,
those of Chittagong and Arakan), on the west by the Sibah of Behar, Dur-
ing the reigns, however, of the Independent Musalmiin Kings (sach as Ilyas
Shiah, and Alauddin Husam Shah in 1502 and his son and successor Nasrat
Shih), the Musalmin Kingdom of Bengal was more extensive than its geogra-
phical hmits, and mcluded noithern portions of Orissa or Jiynagar, Kuch
Behar, Kamrip or Western Assam with portions of Eastern Assam, and the
whole of Upper Behar (a Governor to represent the Bengal Mnsalman King
being posted at Hajipir opposite to Patna), and the eastern portions of South
Behar including Sarkars Monghyr and Behar—(See J.A 8. No 3, 1873,
pp. 221-222). The whole of Orissa was conqueied aud annexed to the Bengal
Musalmin Kingdom in the reign of Salarman Karazani, the last but one inde-
pendent Masalman Afghin King in Bengal

When Bakhtayaér Khilji conqnered Bengal, he ruled (ostensibly as Viceroy
of the Musalmaia Emperor of Delhi, Kutbuddin Athxk) over portions of
Dinajepir, Maldah, Rangpir, Nadiah, Bu bhim, and Bardwau comprising what
was then called Diyar-1-Lakhnauti, and also he held Behar (Tabaqat-1-Nasin,
p. 156). This state of things continued during the rule of his two immetiate
successors, when we fiad Husamuddin Iwaz {a contemporary of Sultan
Shamsnddin Altamsh) extendmg the frontier eastward ta the Brahmapitra
and southward to the sea-bourd, and reigumg asan independent king under
the title of Sultan Ghiasuddin (Tabagqat-1-Nasui, p 163). The Tarikh Firuz
Shahi, p 87 mentions that Emperor Balban in his pursmt of Mughisuddin
Tughral, had to go so far eastward as Suna:gaon, which wonld appeat to have
been within the limits also of Tughral’s Bengal Kingdom = Aguin, in 1850 A.C.
when Ibn-i-Batiitah was in Chittagong, we find this impo:taut seaport was in
the hands of King Fakhruddin ot Sinargaon As Mz Thomas in his learued
discussions on old coins of Bengal Musalman Kings has suggesred, 1t would
seem that so early as the twelfth century there was flee commercul inter-

course between the south-eastern sea-boaid of Bengal and the Arab seaports

and one thousand and one hundred and fifty-eight mfantry, one
hundred and eighty elephants, and four thousand two hundred
and six guns, four thousand and four hundred fleet of boats, con-
stituted the standing army. Adjoining to the northern limits of
Chittagong, 1s the tract of country ruled by the Rajah of Tipperah.
It is an extensive country. The rulers of that country enjoy the
title of Manik, for instance Ny& Manik. The nobles have the title
of Narain.! The Rajah of that place had one thousand elephants
and two laks of infantry in his service. Riding horses are not
available. Between the north and the west of Bengal, pointing
more towards the north, is the province of Kiich Behar. Its length
from east to west, from the beginning of Parganah Bhitarband,?
which is included in the conquered provinces, to Patagaon,? which
is the hmuit of the tract of the Mirang, is 55 kos, and its breadth
from south to north, that 1s, from Parganah Najhat, which is
included in the conquered country, to Pishakarpir,? which adjoms
Khontaghat,* 1s fifty kos. This tract of country, 1m point of the
sweetness of its water, and mildness and salubrity of its air, and

of Baghdad and Basorah; and it would seem it was this commercial Musalman
activity combined with superior martial and moral qualities that paved the
way for Musalmin domination thioughont Bengal

Subsequently m the reign of Ghiasuddin Tughlak Shih, we find the Ben-
gel Musalmin Kingdom has grown so extensive and unwieldy, that we find
him separating Behar from Bengal, and placing 1f under an independent
Governor, whilst Bengal ttself for purposes of convenient admiuistration
was divided into three different sections, v1z (1) Diyir-i-Sanargaon,
comprising Eastern Bengal, (2) Diyar-1-Sitgaon, comprising Western Bengal,
and (3) Dayar-i-Lakhnanti, comprising Northern and Central Bengal A
Governor was appointed to each of the above three admmuatrative Sections
or Divisions, the Governor of Lakhnauti bemg the Supreme Governor or
Viceroy, whilst the two other Governors were placed generally in subor-
dination to him (Terikh-1-Pirog Shahi, p 451). But ths state of things did
not last long; for in the reign of Muhammad Shih Tughlak (Tamkh-i-Firuz
Shahi, p. 480) Bengal again rose as an Independent Musalmin Kingdom, and
as hag been mentioned above, the whole of. Upper Behar with eastern
portions of Southern Behar was again annexed to the Bengal Kingdom, whilst
Orisa aleo was subsequently added to it. This state of things continued
until Akbar came to the throne, when Bengal, with Behar and Orissa, was
annexed to the Mughal Empire of Delhi. See Tebaqat-+-Nagu1, Tamkh-i-Firn-
Shabi, Akbarnamah, 1bn-i- Batutah’a Travels and Mr. Thomas’s “Initial Coinage

the comfort of its iuhabitants, is superior to all the eastern
tvacts of Hindustan. Large oranges thrive here, and other fruits
also grow in abundance. The tree of pepper grows there, its root
is thin, and its branches creep over ponds. Its ear, like the ear
of grape, hangs down from the branches. Its inhabitants belong
to two tribes, namely, Makh and Kij,tits Rajah is of the first
tribe. They mint gold coins, and the coins are called Naraini.
Notable Rajahs have ruled there. One lak and one thousand
infantry are always in the service of the Rajah.

And the country of Kamrip which is also called Kamri? or
Kamtah 1s subject to those Rajahs. The inhabitants of Kamrip
are good-looking, and in magic raise the standard of mastery ; and
many incredible stories are related regarding them. In respect of
the flora of that place, it 1s said that the scent of the flowers continues—~
as fresh as before, some months after their being plucked, and that
with these necklaces are made, and that by cutting trees a sweet
liquid is obtained, and that the mango-tree trails like a climbing
vine over ponds, and produces mango-fruit; and other similar
stories are related

And the mountain of Bhiitin, which is the abode of the Bhitiahs,

horses and the musk-deer are found in this mountain. In the

reign of Huseamuddin Iwaz alias Sultan Ghiasuddin, an immediate successor
of Bakhtiyar Khilji, in the early part of the thirteenth century. (Tabaqat-s-
Nagirr, p 163), At the close of the fifteenth century, its Rijah Nelambhar was
overthrown by Husain Shah, King of Bengal. In ancient days, Kamrip was
noted for its sorcery and the beauty of its women. Rangpir 1 stated to
have been founded by Bakhtiyar Khilji, during his expedition into Tibet —

centre of this tract, a river runs between two rocks, its breadth
18 small, but it is very deep, and 1ts current is strong. An iron-
chain is put across the top of the river, and its ends are affixed
to pieces of rocks on the two sides of the mver, and a second
chain 18 put over the first chain at a distance, equal to the height
of a man. Pedestrians cross the river by placing their feet on
the lower chain, and seizing with their band the upper cham.
And what 1s stranger 1s that horses and all other loads and bag-
gages are ferried across this river along this very chain. The
people of this tract are rnddy-complexioned and fat, their hairs
fall hanging down their heads and necks, Their dress consists of
only one rag, just sufficient to cover the private parts Men and
women of this place dress in the same manner. The pronuncia-
tions in their language resemble those of the people of Kiich
Behar. It 1s said that mines of turquoise-stone also exist in this
mountain.

Between the north and the east of the country of Bengal,
bordering on the tract of Kamrip, is the vildyat or province of
Asham (Assam). In its middle, the river Brahmapitra flows
from east to west. Its lenuth from west to eaat—that is, from
Gowahnti to Sadiah—is about two hundied karoh or kor, and its
breadth from north, that is from the rocky fastnesses of the tribes
of Mari, Majmi, Daphla and Valandah,! to the hills of the Nanga
tribe, is approximately seven or eight days’ journey Its southern
mountains adjomn lengthwise the mountains of Khasia, Kaclor
and Kashmir? and breadthwise they adjoin Autan or Atwin, the
sbode of the Nauga tribe. Its northern mountain skirts length-
wise the lofty ridges of Kamrip, and breadthwise it faces the

the river Brahmapitra; frém Gowahati to the abodes of Mari

Dakhinkél is from the country of Naktirani! to village Sadiah:
The climate of thé lands bordering on the Brahmapitra is for
foreigners poisongus or eight months the rainy season prevails,
and the four yhonths of winter are not free from rain. And the
flowers and fruits of Hindiistin and Bengal are available here ;
aud besides’ these, others are found which are not to be had in
Hindistaw. Wheat, barley, and pulse are not grown, but the soil
is fit for cultivation of all kinds. Salt is scarce and dear, and
what is procurable from the defiles of some of the rocks is bitter
and brackish. The fighting cocks of that country do not turn
back face from enemies ; though the adversary may be strong and
big, they fight so much that the brain of the head becomes dis-
turbed and they die. Large well-formed elephants abound in the
wilds and the mountains And plenty of deer, wild-goats, and
wild-cows, and the horned fighting 1ams are also to be fonnd. In
the sands of the river Brahmapiitra. gold 1s found ; twelve thou-
sand Assamese are employed on this work Every year one ¢ola
of gold per head is paid inte the Rajah’s trensury. But the gold
18 not quite pure, so that one ¢ola of gold sells for eight or nine
rupees, and silver and gold coms are minted in the name of the
Rajah, and shells are current, but copper pice is notin use Musk-
deer is found in the mountains of Ashadm. The bladder of musk
is large, and full of large meces of musk, and is beantiful-looking.
The aloes-wood, which grows in the mountains of Kéamrip and
Sadiah and Lakhigirah, is heavy and full of scent. No tax
is levied fiom its subjects. From every house, out of every thyée
persons, one person has to serve its Rajah, and in serving him,
shows no laxity, and if laxity is visible, he is killed. The Rajah
of that place dwells in a lofty building, and does not put his foot
on the ground, and if he places his foot on the ground, he 1s de-
prived of his 747, And the people of this country have # false
notion that their progenitors were in heaven, and that at one time

the Rajahs of that country are powerful and notable It 1s said
that when the Rajah of that place dies, his servants, male and
female, with some convemences and necessaries, and carpets
and clothes and victuals together with a chiragh full of oil, ave
placed with him in a sepulchral monument, securely covered over
with strong logs of wood !

And adjoining to Assam (Asha@m) is Tibet, and adjoining Tibet,
me Khaté and Machin® The capital of Khata is Khan Baligh,’
which is at a distance of four days from the sea. It is said from
Khin Bahgh to the seashore, a canal has been dug, and both
sides of 11 have been solidly embanked And in the mountains
to the east of Ashim towards Utarakil, at a distance of fifteen
days’ journey, the tribes of Mari and Majmi dwell. In that
mountain black deer and elephants are bred. Silver, copper and
tm are procured from those mountains. The habits of those
tubes (of Mari and Majmi) resemble those of the Assamese, and
iu beauty and refinement their females are superior to the women
of Assam. They have a great horror for the gun, in regard to
which they say. ‘It isa wicked thing, itshouts out, but does
not move from its place, and an infant comes out of its belly, and
kills human beings.”

And between the south and east of Bengal, is situate a large
tract called Arkhang (Arracan);* Chittagong adjoinsit. The male
elephant abounds there, horses are scarce, and camels and asses
can be had at high prices. And cows and buffaloes are not to be
found there, but there 18 an ammal resembling cows and buffaloes,
and of brown colour, which yields milk. Their religion is distinct
from Islim and Hinduism. Barring thew mothers, they can take
all other women for thew wives; for instance, a brother may

And adjoining to the country of Arkhang, 18 situate the country
of Pegii,! between the south and east of Bengal. And the miliary
torce of that country consists of an elephant-corps and infantry.
White elephants ave fonnd in its jungles, and on its boundaries
are mines of minerals and precious stones; owing to this, enmity
exists betweer the Piguans and the Arkhangians.

And bordering on this tract is the country of Mug? The in-
habitants are so many animals diessed up in haman forms. ‘They
eat every animal of the carth and the sea that is procurable.
They spare no animals. Their religion and law are all unsound
And they marry their sisters, born of different mothers. And
the pronunciations ot their language are similar to those of the

And in the southern limits of Bengal, is situate the vilayet
of Odisah (Orissa). From Landahdalil to Malwah and the
passage of the Chilkah lake, are its hmits In the period of the
sovereignty of Sultan Jalalu-d-din Muhammad Akbar Padshah
Ghazi, this country being conquered by Kalapahar was entered
im the Diwan-i-Akbari and annexed to the Nizimat of Bengal.
And its short account is this, that Kalapahar,3 who was one of the
nobles of Babar and who was bold and could work miracles,
under order of Muhammad Akbar Pidshih, engaged m conquer-
ing that country with 12,000 select cavalry. Rajah Makand Deo,

2 The Maghs and Arracanese were one race, ther conntry being Arracan
or Arkhang. They made constant raids in fleets of armed boats up the
nivers of South-Eastern Bengal. During the Viceroyalty of the Mughul Viceroy
of Bengal at Dacca, Nawab Shaista Khan, these raids were considerably
checked, and several of the Magh fleets were captured at the mouth of the
Megna Raver, and the fort of Chittagong was also re-stormed. The Maghe
weis also expelled from the island of Sandip. A large number of Magh
settlers are to be found still in Chittagong, Bakarganj, Noakhal: and Tipperah.
Though onginally Buddhists, they have now intermixed with the people,
and have become Liunduwed or sem1-Hinduised.—See Alumgtrnumah, p. 940.

audience, and attended to the management of the aftairs of his
country, and tor six months he gave his body rest, and went to
sleep. And if anyone awoke him duting his period of slumber,
he was sure to be killed. When the news of the arnval im that
country of Kalapahar with the Imperial forces, came to the ear
of the Rajah, he built the fort of Barahbati,! which 1s a strong

Ismail Ghazi invaded also Jajnagar or Orissa, sacked the vapital Cuttack and
snocessfally stormed the holy city, Purn (see LAS 1674, p 215 and do. 1872,

Sulaiman Kararan, King of Bengal, with a large army under his famous
General Kalipahér advanced into Orisan and defeated the last independent

to his subjection the entire domimon of Odisah (Orissa), so
much so that he carried off the Ram together with all household

L This was Rajah Mukund Deva, Haricandara, who reigned from 1560 to
1568. Mukund Deva was a Telugu by birth. In 1664-65 A.C. a treaty was
concladed between Emperor Akbar and the Rajah, preceded by mutual des-
patch of ambassadors on both sides (see Badaoni p. 76, wherein 1 18 stated
that Hagan Khan Khazanchi and Mahaputér where sent by Akbar as ambassa-
dors to the Rajah of Omssa). As mutual jealousies prevailed between Mughula
and Afghans,this political measure was adopted by Akbar, in order to serve
as a counterpoise to the ambition of the Musalman Afghan King of Bengal,
Sulaiman Karrarim, who had planned to extend his Bengal Kingdom by
annexing Orissa and algo to prevent the latter from helping Akbar’s rebellious
Governor of Taunpur, named Khan Zaman Finding shortly after Akbar
engaged in wars in the west, Sulaiman Kararani, the King of Bengal, attacked

Musalman Sovereigns exercised no authority over this country.!
Of the miracles of Kilipahir, one was this, that wherever in
that country, the sound of Ins dium reached, the hands and the
feet, the ears and the noses of the idols, worshipped by the
Hindus, fell uff their stone-figures, so that even now stone-idols,
with hands and feet broken, and noses and ears cut off, are
lying at several places in that country. And the Hindus pursuing
the false, from blindness of their hearts, with full sense and
knowledge, devote themselves to their worship !

It is known what grows out of stone:

From its worship what 1s gained, except shame ?

Tt is said at the time of return, Kalipahar left a dram in
the jungle of Kéonjhar, which 1s lymg in an upset state. No
one there from fear of hfe dares to set 16 up, so it is related

And Jaggannith, which is a ng temple of the Hindus, is in
this Sabah. It is saul when the Hindus reach Parsiitam, where
Jaggannath is, im order to worship Jaggannath, first they shave
their heads like Musalmans, and at the first door of the house
of Shaikh Kabir, who was a great saint of his time and whose
parents were weavers, they cat and drink his food and water,

1 This ig not strictly correct. See note 7, p, 8 ante.

2 Professor Blochmann has surmised that Kalipahar was originally a Hmdu
who embraced Islam, from the cirenmatance that his proper name was Raju.
Mr. Beveridge in his Analysis ot Khurshid Jahan Numa has followed in
Professor Blochmann’s wake. I see no warrant for this surmise. The
Makhzan-i-Afghani and the Akbarnamah, contemporary records, would not
have failed to notice this fact, it it were so; for 1t would have been a matter
of additional exultation to the Musalman historians. The text describes him
as one of the “Omrah of Babar”; and Babar never dreamt of the policy
of his grandson, Akbar, to employ Hindus in high military capacities o to
make them his ‘Omra.” Furthermore, the name Raji is current amongst
Musalmans (See Blochmann’s Ain, Vol. I, which mentions one Syed Raji of
Barha and Badaoni, p. 823, Vol 2, and din, Vol. 2, p. 871): Badimi, too, inthe
Muntakinbu-l-Towarrkh (p. 42, Vol. 1), mentions Kalapahar as a brother of
Sikandar Shih (alcas Ahmad Khin Sir of Sher Shih’s family) who occupied
Bihar as tuyul under Akbar, (The Makhzan-i-Afghani gives afull description
of Kalapshar's conquest. He was hilled in 1582 A.O. ina fight with Aziz
Kokah hetween Colgeng and Raymahal.

the rule of Independent Musalman Kings in Bengal. He was the leader of a

SECTION II —DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FEATURES
OF THE COUNTRY OF BENGAL.

Be it known to the appraisers of the pearls of past chronicles that
most of the Instorians have narrated that when Ham, son of Noh
(Noah) the prophet (may he be m peace !), with the permission of
his holy father, set himself to colonize the south, he girded up his
loin for accomplishing this, and deputed his sons—the first of
whom was Hind, the second Sind, the third Habash, the fourth
Zanaj, the fifth Barbar, and the sixth Nubah—in all directions
on colomzing expeditions. And the tract that cach of them colo-
nized was called after him. The eldest son, Hind, having come to
the country of Hindistin, it was so named after him. And Sind
in the company of his elder brother, having set himself to colovize
the tract of Sind established himself there, and that was named
after him. But Hind had four sons, the first was Pirab, the
second. was Bang, the third was Dakin, and the fourth was Nahar-
wal. And every tract that was colonized by each, is still called
after him. And Dakin, son of Hind, had three sons, and the coun-
try of Dakin was parcelled between them. Their names were
Mathat, Kanar, and Talang; and Dakhinans are all descended
from him, and up to this time all the three tribes dominate there.

And Naharwal had three sons, namely, Babruj, Kanoj and
Malraéj. After them cities were also named.

of Musalmans is the Parmeshur of the Hindus, that they ought to be
tolerant of each others creeds, and to regard each others as fellow-brethren
The labours of Kabir may be placed between 1880 and 1420 A.C, and reflect
not only credit on him, but illustrate what ethical and spiritual progress took
place amongst the people of India under the impact of Islam It may be
added that on Kabir’s death, both Hindus and Musalmans claimed his
body; so catholic and liberal was he in his views, This great theistic move-
ment set on foot by Kabir, received expansion in the following century by
the labours of Chaitanya, the Nuddea leader of Vishnuism, in Bengal who
flourished in the reign of Saltan Alau-d-din Husain Shih, King of Bengal,

And Pirab, who was the eldest son of Hind, had forty-two sons,
and, within a short time, the descendants multiplied and colo-
nized different countrics, and when they became numerous, they
raised one of themselves to be the chief and to look after the
management of the realm

And Bang, the son of Hind, getting childien born to him, colo-
nized the country of Bengal. ‘The name of Bengal was omgmally
Bang, And the reason why the word @ was added to 1t, is this:
@ in the Bengali language means au ‘embankment’ or raised ground,
which 1s placed round « garden or cultivation, so that floods may
not enter it As m ancient times, the chieftams of Bengal
on lowlands which were sitnaute at the foot of hills, used to raise
mounds about ten cubits Ingh and twenty cubits broad, and
to make homes, cultivationy, and buildings within thom, people
used to call this country Bangalah! The chmate of Bengal
1s temperate, and owing to proximity to the sea and owing
to heavy rains, 1s very damp. The ramy season begins from

for six months the rams contmue, this 1s unlike other parts
of Hindistan, where tams set in from the middle of the month
of Khirdad, which the Hindis call Asar and Inst till Shahriwar
which Hindis call Asin, for four months. In the rainy season,
the lowlands of Bengal get flooded, and the climate becomes
had, especially towards the end of the rainy season. Human
beings as well as animals become sick and die. The soil
contains much damp, so that in many places they build two-
storeyed buildings, made of lime and brick Notwithstanding
that they make the floor of lime and brick, the lower roome are
not fit for habitation, and if any one lives there he soon falls sick.
And owing to excessive humidity, the sol of Bengal has much
power of sprouting, for instance, some sorts of paddy, in propor-
tion to the rise of water, solong as they are not inundated, shoot

expression “Bang” 1s invariably used. In the Tarikh-1-Fuuz Shahi, the
expression “ Bangalah” or “ Bengal” is used.

of both the upper and lower classes, consists of one strip of
cloth just sufficient to cover the private parts. The males wear one
white strip of cloth, called generally a dhot:, which is tied from
below the navel down to the leg, and a small turban about two or
three cubits long 1s tied on the side of the head, so that the whole
skull of the head and the hair are visible. And the females wear
one strip of cloth called a sari, half of it is wrapped round from
below the navel to the leg, and the other half being drawn across
aside 1s thrown down the neck. ‘They are bareheaded, and do
not wear any other cloth; nor do they wear shoes and stockings
Both males and females daily rub mustard oil over their bodies,
and bathe im tanks and rivers. The Bengali females do not observe
pardah, and go out of their houses for the porformance of
evacuations und other household duties. And the wildness and
habitation of this country are similar, in that the people erect
huts of thatch, made up of bamboos and straw. ‘lhew utensils
aro generally earthen, and few are of copper. Whenever quitting
one place they migrate to another, straghtway they erect a
thatched hut, similar to their former one, and collect earthen
utensils. Most of their habitations are in jungles and forests, so
that their huts are encircled with trees. And incase ove of the
huts catches fire, all the huts are burnt down, and after the con-
flagration they get no trace of their habitations, except through
trees which surrounded their huts. Most of them travel by water,
especially in the rainy season, in which season they keep boats,
small and large, for journeys and for going to and fro For
travelling by land, they have conveyances, such as simghasan !
and palk: aud jowalah. Elephants are captured in some parts
of the country; good horses are not procurable, and, if had, they
cost much. A curious sort of boat is made in this country for
capturing forts. Aud it is in this wise: the boat is large, and

district. Here we get a glimpse of the old fiscal system in regard to its
acconnt-branch. In the collection-branch of the Musalman fiscal s}stem,
Shiqdars (corrupted into Hindu family names S:kdars) presided over Mahals,
Majmuahdars (corrupted into Hindu family names of Mozumdars) presided
overa group or circle of Mahals or a Turf, and over an aggregate of Mahals
or Turfs, corresponding to a modern District, an Ami! premded, and over an
aggregate of Districts or a Division, the Districts, there was a local Diwan,
The last two functionaries were generally Musalmans, whilst the first two
subordinate functionaries were wmost invariably Hindus.

the prow of it, which is called in the dialect of the country
galhi, is made so high that when it is placed alongside the wall
of a fort, people from the boat can get on to the wall from it, and
enter the fort. Auda kind of carpet is manufactured from the
linseed plant, which is very pretty and much liked. And precious
‘stones, pearls, jasper, and ruby do not exist in this country. From
other countries these are imported into the ports of this Sabah.
And the best fruit of this country is mango, which in some parts is
large, sweet, and without strigns, and tasty, and has a small stone.
And the tree of three years’ growth—of the height of a man- -
bears fruit. And large oranges, which are called kaunia, and small
oranges, which are called na@rang?, grow well in this country. And
varieties of citrons are available. And lemons, pineapples, cocoa-
nuts, betelnuts, palm-fruits, jack-frnuits and plantains have no end.
And grapes and melons, &c., do not grow here; though the seeds
of melons and grafts of vines have been often planted in this
country, they have never thrived. Sugarcanes, good, delicate and
sweet, red, white and black in colour, grow heretin abundance ;
ginger and pepper in some parts grow abundantly, and betel
leaves also grow in abundance, and silk is also produced well and
in abundance here. Good silk-stuffs are mannfactured in this
eountry, and cotton-fabrics of good quality are turned out here.
Rivers, small and large, are plenty in this country, and the prac-
tice of digging tanks is very common. People in this country
seldom drink the water of wells, because everywhere the water of
tanks and rivers 1s found in abundance. And generally the water
of wells is salt, but with a little digging of the soil water
comes out.

And the best of rivers is the Ganges (Gang), which rises
from the northern mountains of Hindistin at the point called
Goumukhah, flows through the provinces of Hinditstan, Farrakha-
bad, Alahabad, and Behar into Bengal, and in Bengal at a place
called Qazihita,! within the Sarkir of Birbakabad, it is named
Paddé. From this place, a branch of the Ganges separates, flows
down Murshidibéd, and at Nadiah joins the Jalangi river, and then
flows into the sea. This branch is called Bhagriati, and it goes
towards Chittagong, flowing through the sea. The Ganges at
Alahabad joins the rivers Joun (or Jamna) and-Sirsati, and near

Hajipir it unites also with the Gandak, the Sari and the Son,
and becomes very broad. And the place where the three rivers
unite is called Tirbini by Hindus, and its sanctity im the eye
of the Hindusis immeasurable And the Ganges, Siirsati, and
Joun or (Jamna), n flowmg towards Chittagong and the sea,
branch off in a thousand rivalets And Hindus have written
volumes on the sanctity of these rivers. Considering the water
of these rivers sacred, they fancy that bathing there washes
off the sins of a lifetime; especially bathing at certam ghdts
of the Ganges, snch as Bendras, Alahahid, and Hardwar, is
regarded as very sacred. The rich amongst the Hindis, getting
their supplies of the Ganges water from long distances, take
particnlar care of 1t, and on certain auspicions days, worship
the same. The truth of the matter is, that the water of the
Ganges, in sweetness, lightness, and tasteness has no equal, and
the water of this river, however long kept, does not stink. There
is no river bigger than it in Bengal.

And another of the big rivers of Bengal is the Brahmaputra,
which flows from the regions of Khaté towards Koch, and thence
by the way of Baziihd flows down into the sea. In the environs
of Chittagong, 1t is called the Megna. The smaller rivers are
countless. On both banks of most of the rivers, naddy 1s eculfti-
vated Another feature of this country, unlike that of other coun-
tries of Hindiistén, is that they ent grafts of mango and lemon-trees,
and plant them, and these, in the very first year, bear fruit.

SECTION JIL—RELATING TO A DESCRIPTION OF CHER-
TAIN TOWNS AND FOUNDATION OF CERTAIN
CITIES IN THE COUNTRY OF BENGAL.

The city of Lakhnauti, which in past times was the Capital of
Bengal, was founded by Sangaldib, It .ssaid that at the time
when Firiz Rai, the Rajah of Hindistan, being defeated by Rus-
tam Pastan,! fled to Tirhiit, and from there fleeing to the moun-
tuys -of Jharkhand * and Gondwarah,’ died, Rustam Dastan, who

Rustam Zal.

was known mn Muh.mmadan times, whilst “ Bharkandah ” denoted “ Sonthal

was displeased with his insolence, not bestowing the kingdom of
Hindistin on the Rajah’s children, awarded the sovereignty of
Hindistin to a Hindi, named Siraj. Siraj became a powerful
Rajah, subjugated the kingdom of the Dakhin and also the king-
dom of Bengal. When Siraj died and the sovereignty passed to his
son, Bahraj, disturbances occurring in all parts of the kingdom,
ambition showed itself in every head, and at length a Brahmin,
named Kadar, coming out from the mountains of Sawalik, and be-
coming victorious after fightings possessed himself of the reins of
sovereignty. Towards the end of his reign, a person named Sangal-
dib,* emerging from the environs of Kuch, which adjoins the limits
of Bengal, brought to his subjection, first, the countries of Bengal
and Behar, and then fighting against*Kedar became victorious, and
building the city of Lakhnanti,’ made it his capital. And for

1 It is worthy of note that there 1s a town called Siraj-garh (or fort of
Siiray) im Monghyr district, on the southern banks of the Ganges, and close
to Maulanagar, where there is also an old Mahammadan Khangah founded by
Mahabat Jang.

% In Firishta, ‘Shangal.’ in the list of Hindu kings given in the Ain-i-
Akbari, I do not find this name,

8 The authentic history of the city begins with its conquest in 1198 A.C.
(594 A.H.) by the Mahammadans, who made it !their first capital am Bengal.
(See Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, p. 151, Pers. Text). This was the period when were
erected numerous mosques and other Muhammadan bmildings. (See Hunt.
Imp. Gazetteer, Vol. III, p. 388, also Ravenshaw’s and Oreighton’s ‘“ Ruins
of Gaur”). When the Mnsulman kings of Bengal estabhshed their inde-
pendence, they transferred the seat of government to Sunargaon and Pan-
doah. Panduah was soon after deserted, and the royal residence re-transferred
to Gaur, whilst Sunargaon continued as capital of East Bengal. Minhajus
Siraj visited the city in 641 H. or 1245.4.C., and gives an account of at in
his Tabaqit-1-Nasiri. (p. 162, Pers, Text) Abil Fazl m the Ain notices it
(see p. 128, Vol. 2, din, Jar. Tr.), and states that the city was known in his
time both as Lakhnanti and Gaur, and that the latter epithet was changed
to “Jinnatabad” by Emperor Humayun. Badaimi (p. 58, Vol. 1, Pers. Text)
states that Bakhtiyar Ghori founded a city and named it after himself ‘Gour’
The capital was shifted in Sulaiman Kararani’s time further westward to
Tandih, Durmg the conquest of Bengal by the Mughuls under the Em-
peror Akbar, Gaur again became the headquarters of the Mughal Govern-
ment, and the Mughul Impenalists under Munaim Khau, Khan-i-Khanan,
the first Mughul Viceroy of Bengal, oceupied it. A pestilence, however, broke
out, in conrse of which Munaim died—and also thousands of troops and
people daily (see pp. 318 and 376, din, Vol. 1, Bloch’s Tr. and Badaoni, Vol 2,

two thousand years it remained the Capital of Bengal. In the
time of the Mughul Emperors it became ruined, and instead of 16
Tandah became the Viceregal Capital. Afterwards Tandah was
also ruined, and Jahangirnagar, and lastly Murshidabad, became
the Viceregal Capital. The reason for the name of Gaur is un-
known, but it 1s guessed that in the period of the rule of the sons
of Nojgoriah, perhaps this name was given. And Emperor
Humayun, considering Gaur an inauspicious name, changed 16 to
Jinnatébad. This city at present is in complete ruin, and has
become the haunt of lions and tigers. Excepting traces of gates
of the fort, and dilapidated buildings, and the mosque, and founda-
tions of the building of Qadam-Rasil, nothing else exists.

The place where monarchs dwelt in gardens with friends,
Has become the abode of crows and vultures and the haunt
of lions and jackals!

Gaur contained a large fort, traces whereof are still visi-
ble. On the eastern side of the city are the lakes of Jhatiah and
Bhatiah and other lakes, and the embankment! continues from that
to this time, though it was stronger and kept out the ficod of water
in the rainy season, when the city was in a flourishing condition.
At present, in the rainy season, boats pass across it, and every-
thing is inundated. Towards the north of the Fort, to the dis-

p. 217), and the Mughul metropolis of Bengal was removed to Tandih, and
thence shortly after to Raymahal or Akbarnagar, which remained the capital
of Bengal, until it was removed to Dacca or Jahangirnagar, and lastly to
Maurshidabad, Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton places the inhabited area of Gaur at
20 square miles, contammg over 600,000 souls. The author of Khurshed
Jahapnuma notes the following prmcipal buildings as still existing ~

1. The Qadam-Rasnul, a sqnare, one-domed building mn the enclosure of the
Fort, erected by Sulfan Nasrat Shih, son of Sultan Allandin Husain Shah in
987 A.H. (1530 A 0.).

2. The Minar, north-east of the Qadam-Rasul, bmlt by Sultin Firoz Shah
The height of the Minar is about 50 cubits, and its circumference about 5.
cubits, Firaz reigned in 893 A H, (1487 A.C.).

When I vimted Gaur from Maldah in 1887 I found also portions of the
rampart, the gateway, and the Qadam-Rasul building yet extant,

} The embanked road a bridge is described m Tabaqat-1-Nasri (p. 162).
It connected Lakhnauti with Lakhnur m Rar on the western side, and

“hnauti with Deocote in Barind on the eastern side, and was constructed
by Hussamuddin Iwuz alas Sultan Ghiasuddin.

tance of one kos,a large building of ancient times existed, and
also a tank called Peishari—the water where of was noxious, who-
ever drank it became attacked with bowl-diseases and died. It
is said that in past times, criminals were imprisoned in that tank,
and by drinking the water of it they immediately died. And Em-
peror Akbar, taking pity, put a stop to this form of punishment.

—— Qe
CITY OF MURSHIDABAD.

The city of Murgshidabad! is a large town situate on the banks
of the river Bhagirati. Both banks of the river are populated.

1 Murshidabid waa the latest Muhammedan Capital of Bengal, ita immedi-
ate predecessor for over 100 years being Dacca or Jahangirnager, in Hastern
Bengal. In 1704 A.C., Murshid Quli Khan also known as Jafar Khan (then
the Mughul Diwan) falling ont with Prince Azim-us-shan, the Mughul Vice-
rey or Nawab at Dacca, transferred the seat of government from Dacca to
the little town of Makhsiisibad, and named the place after himself “ Murshda-

ad.” After the battle of Plassey in 1757 AC, Clive on entering Murshidé-
bad describes it thus* “This orty 18 as extensive, populous, and rich as the
city of London... The mhabitants, uf inchned to destroy the Europeans,
might have done so with stacks and stones.” Hven after the battle of Plassey,
Murshidabid remained for some years the seat of administration, The result
of tho battle of Plassey was at the time appreciated both by Clive and the
people, for the reason that it ended the misrule of Sirajudaula, who had ren-
dered himself obnoxious both to the people and the English by his youthfal
pranks and vagaries; it was not regarded atthe time as interfering with
Musulman sovereignty. it merely affected the substitution of a new Nawab
(Mir Jafar) for Sirajudaula. In 1765, the East India Company received
the grant of Diwani or financial admimetration of Bengal, Behar, and Orissa
from the Mughul Emperor of Delhi, Shih Alim, and in the following year
Lord Clive, as the Emperor’s Diwan, presided in person at the Puniya, or
annual collection and settlement of revenues. On this occasion, the young
Nawab Nazim (as administrative and military representative of the Mughul
Emperor of Delhi) sat on the masnad, with the Diwan (Lord Clive) on his
right band. The work of administration still remained in the hands of
Muhammadan officials. In 1772, Warren Hastmgs removed the Supreme,
Civil, and Orininal Courts from Murshidaébid to Calcutta, but after three
years the Oriminal court (Nizimat Adalat) was re-transferred to Murshi-
aabad, and it was only in 1790, under Lord Cornwallis, that the entire
revenue, civil, and criminal staff were posted in Calcutta. The Murshidabad
Mint, the recognized emblem of metropolitan supremacy, was abolished in
1799. Thenceforth, Murghidabid has been left only as the residence of the
Nawab, a descendant of Mir Jifa: +11 now it has ceased to be of importance.

In the beginning, a merchant named Makhsiis Khan built a
serai or guest-honse there, and called the place Makhsisabad.
The houses of a few shop-keepers were placed there. In the
reign of Emperor Anrangzib Alamgir, Nawab Jafar Khan
Nasuri, who held the office of Diwan of Orissa, received the title of
Kartalab Khan and obtained the office of Diwan of Bengal.
After his arrival at Jahangirnagar, otherwise called Dhakah
(Dacca), which at that time was the Viceregal Capital and where
from before Prince Azim-u-shin, who had been appointed Vice-
roy by Bmperor]Aurangzib (as will be setforth here after) lived,
finding that he (Jafar Khan) could not pull on with the Prince,
put forward the pretext that the mahals of Bengal were at a long
distance from that place (Dacca), separated himself from association
with the Prince, and established himself at Makhsiisabad, and placed
there the Amlas of Zemindars, and Qaniingos and other officials em-
ployed in connection with the Revenue Administration of Crown-
Jands. And at Dughariah, which was quite a wilderness, he erected
a palace, established the Board of Revenue (Dewankhanah) and the
Court of Exchequer, and made collections of the Imperial revenue.
And when he was appointed permanently Siibahdar (Viceroy) of
Bengal and Orissa in addition to the office of Diwan, with the
title of Murshid Qaili Khan and with the gift of a valuable Khil‘at,
and of the standard and the Naqirah (a royal drum) and the
advancement of Mansab, on arrival at Makhsiisibad, he improved
the city, and called it after his own name “ Murshidabad.” And
establishing a mint! there, he had the words “struck at Murshi-
dabad” inscribed on the coins From that time, this city became the
Viceregal seat. It is a beautiful city. Its inhabitants, in the society
of the Sibahdars, being thrown into contact with the people of
Delhi, in point of refinement of manners and conversation, re-
semble the people of Hindiistin, unlike those of other parts
of Bengal. Amongst its buildings, none that was seen was note-
worthy, except the Imambarah building, which was erected by

1 it may be of interest to note here that the followmg mint towns existed
in Bengal during the earlier Mahammadan kings: (1) Lakhnanuti, (2) Firuz-
Sbid (Pandiish), (3) Sitgion, (4) Shahr-i-Nau (not identified), -(5) Ghiyaapir,
(6) Sunargion, (7) Muazzamabad (i,e., Sylhet or Mymensingh), (8) Fatha-
bad (Faridpir town), (9) Khalifatahbid (Bagerhat town in Jessore), and (10)

Nawab Siraju-d-daulah. Its praise is beyond description; its
equal is not to be found in the whole of Hindistin, Although at
present one-tenth of it does not exist, yet a remnant of it is a fair
specimen of the original edifice. These two verses of Maulana
‘Urfi Shirazi,! (May peace of God be on him!) being found to be
apposite to the present case, are transcribed below :—

How much of morning is known to the dwellers at its gate,

In that in its neighbourhood, the sunset has no access;

‘Wonderful is the fairness of the building, that in gazing at it,

The glance does not turn back to the socket from the sieht

of the wall!

And the palaces of Miitijhil* and Hirajihl, which were most
beautiful, at present have been dug up from their foundations, and
are in complete ruin.

PORTS OF HUGHLI AND SATGAON,

The Ports of Highli and Satgaon® are at a distance of half a
karoh from each other. In former times, Satgaéon was a large
city, thickly populated, and was the seat of a Governor. And
the factories of the Christian Portugese, and of other traders were
also there. When Satgion fell into rnin owing to its river silt-
ing up, the port of Hiighli became populous, The Faujdars of

1 Urfi was a famous Persian poet of Shiraz, attached to the Court of Em-
peror Jahangir. He possessed poetical genius of a gh order, and was mach
appreciated by the Emperor, I published an English translation of some of
his “ Odes” or “ Qasaid,” many years ago.

8 The palace of Mutijhil wae for several years, after the installation of
Nawab Mir Jafar, the residence of the British Political Resident attached to
the Court of the Nawab Nizims of Bengal.

8 Satgaon, the ancient royal port or “Ganges Regia’ of Bengal. It lay at
the point of junction of the Hiighli and the holy Saraswati, The river Saras-
wati silted up durmg the first-half of the sixteenth centary, and the Por-
tnguese-iétchants found that the harbour of Satgion waa no longer practica-
ble, and accordingly fixed their port at Gholaghit in 1537, a few miles lower
down on the same east bank of the river. Gholaghfit soon became the chief
emporium, and took the name of the river, that is, Highli town or part.
Satgion 15 now become a petty village, thongh when I visited it from Highli
in 1888, I found traces of a rained mosque. The first mention of Sitghon
that I find in Muhammadan history is in the reign of Suljan Ghiasuddin Tugh-
luk Shih who invaded Bengal to chastise Bahadur Shih, King of Sunargaon.
(See pp 45-46 Tarikh-i-Piruzshahi),

this port had always been appointed directly by the Emperors of
Delhi, and«had httle concern with the Nazims or Viceroys of
Bengal. Nawab Jafar Khan brought the office of Faujdar of this
port within his jurisdiction, as an appendage to the Nizamat and
Diwani of Bengal, as will be mentioned hereafter, if God pleases.
And im that the abovementioned Nawab placed the centre of the
financial resources of the country of Bengal upon the customa-
duties levied from traders, he maintained peaceful and hberal re-
lations with the merchants of England, China, Persia, and Turan,
and beyond the legitzmate imports he did not levy one dam
oppressively or against the established usage Hence the port of
Haghli, im his time, became more populous than before. And
merchants of all the ports of Arabia and Ajam,! and English
Christians who were ship-owners and wealthy Mughuls made their
quarters there; but the credit of the Mughul merchants was
greater than that of merchants belonging to other classes. The
English were absolutely prohibited from erecting towers and build-
ing bazars and forts and moats. After this, when oppression and.
extortion of the Faujdars increased, the port of Highli declined,
and Calcutta owing to the hhberality and protection afforded by the
English, and the hghtness of the duties levied there, became
populons.

THE CITY OF CALCUTTA.
The City of Calentia? in past times was a village in a talugah
endowed in favour of Kali, which is the name of an idol which is
there. Inasmuch as in the language of Bengal, ‘ Karta’ and

1 Ajam. The Arabs divided the races of the world into the Arabis and the
Ajamés or non-Arabs. Persia Proper wag called Irak-1-Ajam.

& In 1596 A.C., it is mentioned in the Ain-r-Akbari as a rent-paying village
named “ Kalikatta ” under Sarkir Sitgion. (See din, p. 141, Vol. 2, Jar. Tr.)
In 1686, m conséquence of a rupture with the Musulmin authorities at
Highli port, the English merchants, led by their Chief, Job Charnock, were
obhged to quit their factory there and to retreat to Siitaniti (now a northern
quarter of Caloutta). Their new settlement soon extended itself southwards
first over the village of “ Kulikatta”’ (between the present Oustoma-Houre and
the Mint) and subsequently over the village of Gobindpir (which existed to
the south of the present site of Fort William). In 1689, it became the head-
quarters of the servants of the East India Company employed in Benga,
factories. In 1696, the original Fort William was built, being replaced by 5

named Kalikata, meaning that its owner was Kali. Gradually, by 2

dropped it was called Yalkata, The following is the account of the
foundation of this city and the establishment of the English factory
there. In the period of the Nizamat of Nawab Jafar Khan, the
factory of the English Company, which existed in the port of
Highli, close to Lakhoghat and Mughulpirah, suddenly after sun-
set when the English Chiefs were at dinner commenced crumbling
down ; the English Chiefs harum-scarum ran out, and saved them-
selyes from this whirlpool of destruction. Butall their chattels
and properties were washed away by the tide. Many cattle and
some human beings also perished. Mr. Charnock, the English
Chief, purchasing the garden of Benires, the Company’s Gu-
mashta, which was situate in Lakhoghat, adjoming to the town,
cut down its trees, and laid the foundation of a factory, and com-
menced erecting two-storeyed and three-storeyed buildings. When
the boundary walls were completed and they were about to roof
them with the main beams, the nobility and the gentry of the Sayyid
and Mughul tribes, who consisted of mch merchants, represented
to Mir Nasir, Faujdar of Hiaghli, that when the strangers would
get upon the terraces of their high buildings, it would interfere
with the sanctity and _privacy of their ladies and families. The
Faujdar communicated the gist of this state of things to Nawab
Jafar Khan, and subsequently deputed there all the Mughals
and the whole of the nobility and the gentry. These, in the
presence of the Nawab, set forth their grievances. Nawab Jafar
Khan despatched an order to the Faujdar prohibiting absolutely
the English from placing a brick over a brick and from laying a
timber over a timber. The Faujdar, directly on the rece:pt of the
order of prohibition, directed that none of the masons and.

new one in 1742, the above three villages being purchased in 1700 from Prince
Azam, son of Emperor Aurangzeb. In 1756, the town was sacked and Fort
Wilham captured by Nawib Sirajn-d-daulah, who changed its name to
Alinagar. In Jannary 1757 it was re-taken by the Enghsh under Admirals
Watson and Clive. A new fort, the present Fort William, was commenced
by Olive, but it was finished in 1773, when the maidan was also opened ont,
In this connection, it may be added, that the author of the “Seiral Muta-
kherin,” though hostile to Siraju-d-daulah,and though a contemporary historian,
does not say a word about the “ Black Hole” affair !

carpenters should do work in connection with the buildings, and
in consequence the buildings remained incomplete Mr. Charnock,
getting enraged, prepared to fight. But as he had a small
force and except one ship, no other ships were then there, and
besides the suthority of Nawab Jafar Khan was overawing, and
the Mughals were numerous, and the powerful Faujdér was on
their side, seeing no good in shaking hands and feet, of necessity,
raised the anchor of the ship. And directing from the top
of the deck of the ship a lense-burner towards the populous
part of the town alongside the bank of the river including
Chandanagore, he set it on fire and started. The Faujdar, in
order to enquire into this matter, wrote to the officer in charge of
the garrison of Makhwa, to the effect thatthe ship should not be
allowed to pass on. The above officer placed across the river an
iron chain, every link whereof was ten seers in weight, and which
had been kept ready alongside the wall of the fort for the purpose
of blocking the passage of the boatsof the Arracanese und Magh
enemies, by bemg drawn from one bank of the river to the other.
The ship on arriving at the chain got blocked, and could not
move down further. Mr Charnock cut up the chain with an
English sword and effected his passage through, and sailed down
with the ship to the sea, and started for the country of the-Dakhin.
In that, the Emperor Aurangzeb at that time was in the Dakhin,
and the Mahratta free-booters had ent off supplies of food-grains
from all sides, a great famine occurred amongst the Imperial
troops. The Chief of the (English) factory in the Karnatik
supplied the Imperial army with food-stnffs, carrying the same on
board the ships, and thus rendered loyal and good service. The
Emperor Aurangzeb being pleased with the English, enquired as to
what the English Company prayed for. The English Chief peti-
tioned for the grant of a Sanad (Royal patent), permitting the
erection of factories in the Imperial dominions, and especially the
erection of the Bengal factory. The petition was granted by the
Emperor, and an Imperial Farman (patent) was issued, remitting
all customs on ships of the English Company, and directing the
levy from them of Rs. 3,000, by way of tribnieto the Royal
Oustoms-house, and permitting the erection of a factory. Mr.
Charnock, with the Imperial Farman and orders, returned from
the Dakhin to Bengal, and at a place called Chanak (Barrackpix)

landed. He sent agents with presents, tribute, and gitts, &c., to
Nawab Jafar Khan, and obtained permission to build a factory at
Calcutta, m accordance with the Imperial Sanad, and building a
new factory there, devoted himself to the improvement of the
town, and opened trading transactions with Bengal To this day
the factory is notable.

Calcutta is a large city on the banks of the river Bhagirati.
It is a large port, and the commercial emporium of the English
Company, and is subject to them. Small ships, called sloops,
always every year come to that port from China, England, and
othe: parts, and many remain there. At present, this city is the
place of residence of the English Chiefs and officers and employés.
The buildings are solidly made of lime and brick. As its soil is
damp and salt, from proximity to the sea, the buildings of that
city are two-storeyed and three-storeyed. The lower rooms are
unfit for dwelling. The buildings are constructed after those of
England; they are well-ventilated, commodious, and lofty. The
roads ofthat city are broad and paved with pounded brick. And
besides the Englisn Chiefs, the Bengalis, the Armenians, é&c., there
are also rich merchants. The water of wells in this city, owing to
salt, is unfit for drinking, and if anyone drinks it, he suffers much
Tn summer and rainy seasons, the water of the river also become
bitter and salt, but the water of tanks, which are plenty, is
dronk. The sea is forty Karok distant from this place ; within
every day and nightthe water of the river has one flow and one
ebb. At times of full moon, for three days, the tide comes furiously
once in course of a day and night. Itshows a wonderful condition
and a strange furiousness, It drives across the banks many boats,
and wrecks them, but those which are not on the sides of the rivers
are left undamaged. Consequently, on that day, at that place
boats, both small and large, ave left without anchor This tide in
the language of Bengal is called ban, and the tide which occurs
daily is called yodr An earthen fort has been erected to the south,
outside the city. The English are wonderful in ventors. To re-
late its praise is difficult; one ought to see it, to appreciate it.
Viewed externally from any of the four sides, the quadrangular
rampart looks low hke the slopes of tanks; but viewed internally,
it looks lofty. Inside the fort, there are lnrge and lofty buildings.
Wonderful wor kmanship has been displayed in the construction of
the fort; and other curiogs and rare workmanships are visible in

this city. In point of beauty of its edifices and the novelty of its
arts, no city 18 equal to it, barring Dehli, whichis unique Bntits
dtawback 1s that its air is putrid, 1ts water salt, and its soil so
damp that the ground, though protected by 100f, and cemented
with brick and lime, is damp owing to excessive moisture, and
the doors and walls, to the height of two or three cubits, are
also wet anddamp. For four months of winter, the climate 1s
not very unhealthy, but during eight months of summer and rainy
seasons, 1t 1s very unhealthy At the present day, when since a
few yeats the countries of Bengal, Behar, and Orissa have paased
into the possession of the Chiefs of the English Company, this
city has become the seat of Governmentof these dominions The
head of these Chiefs, who 1s styled Governor-General, resides
in this city, and his deputies are appointed and sent out to each
district, and remit to Calcutta the revenue-collections fiom each
district! The officers of the Board of Revenue are in Oalcutta

Wonderful is the City of Calcutta in Bengal,

For 1¢ is a model of China and England.

Its buildings please the heart and the soul,

And tower to the height of the air.

A master-hand has wrought such workmanship in it,

That everything is apaint and everything beautiful.

From the exquisite workmanship of the English,

Reason, in contemplating it, becomes confounded.

1 Until 1707, when Caloutta was first declared a Presidency, it had been
dependent on tha older English settlement at Madras. From 1707 to 1778
it was on an equal footing with presidencies at Madras and Bombay. In
1773, an Act of Parliament was pussed, under which 1t was declared that the
Presidency of Calcutta should exercise a sort of general control over other
possessions of the English East India Company, that the Chief of the Pres-
dency of Calcutta should be called Governor-General. In 1772, Warren
Hastings had given into the hands of the servants of the East India, Oom-
pany the general administration of Bengal which had hitherto been in the
hands of Muhammadan Nizamat offimals, and had removed the Treasury from
Murshidabad to Calentta. The latter town thus became both the capital of
Bengal and the seat of Supreme Government In 1834, the Governo:-General
of Bengal was created Governor-General of India, and was allowed to appoint
a Deputy-Governor of Bengal to manage the affairs of Bengal in hie absence,
In 1884, a separate Lientenant-Governor was appointed fot Bengal, Bebar,
and Orisaa.

The hat-wearing English dwell in it,

They are all truthful and well-behaved.

The dwellings are like these, the dwellers are like those,
How far can I detail their praises P

Its streets are clean and paved,

The air every morning passes through and sweeps them.
In every alley moonhke faces move about,

Robed in pretty and clean dresses.

Thei: faces are bright with radiance, hke the moon,

You might say the moon has become the earth-trotter.
One is like the moon, another is like Jupiter,

Another is hke Venus in effulgence,

When large numbers, like wandering stus, stroll about,
The alleys resemble the milky-way.

You see, if you go to bazar,

The rare goods of the world there

All the articles that exist in four quarters of the globe,
Yon find in its bazar, without search.

If T were to depict the people of art therein,

The pen would fail to pourtray such a picture.

But 16 is well known to all, {England.
That pre-eminence 1n workmanship pertains to China and
Its plain is level like the surface of the sky,

Roads are fixed on it, ike the equator.

People, whilst promenading im gardens,

Like wandering stars, meet each other in thew walks.
Such a city in the country of the Bengalis,

No one had seen, no one had heard of.

TOWN OF PURNIAH?

In former times it was called Pargana-i-havil1 Rupees 32,000
were its revenue collections Smee the Rajah ot Birnagar also
had a force of 15,0U0 cavalry and infantiy, and other inhabitants
of that part ot the Chakwaz tribe, &c, were 1efractory and of
plundering propensity, and used to annoy much the travellers,
therefore on the lunits of the Marang, ® the fort* of Jalilgadah,
to a distance ot two kaohs from Purniah, was erected, and a com-
mandant, in charge of the fort, was posted there. In compliance
with the petition of Nawab Sait Khan,® grandson of Amir Khan
the elder, who enjoyed the name and title of his father, and was
descended from Syeds and illustiious Omra, and had royal con-
nections, Nawab Jafar Khan applied to Emperor Auiaugzeb for
the formet’s deputation, and accordingly Saif Khau was deputed for
the purpose of chastising the Rajah of Birnagar ® and other mal-

contents of that part of the country. Nawab Jafar Khan, con-
sidering the arrival of such a person to be an acquisition, conferred
the office of Faujdar of Zila’ Purniah and that of Commandant
of Jalalgadah upon him, and also settled on him the Pargana
of Birnayar alias Dharmpir,! and Gindwarah, which 1s in the
province of Behar, pertaining to Purniah, and also the mahals of
the Jagir forming an appendage to the office of Commandant of the
above Fort. The aforesaid Khan, being appointed independent
ruler of the district, after much fighting expelled Darjan,Singh. *
son of Bir Shah, the Rajah of Birnagar, who was disloyal and
refractory, aud brought the aforesaid pargana under his subjection,
and having thoroughly chastised the other malcontents freed the
roads from all perils He represented the state of affairs to the
Emperor, and submitted that the mahals were small, and that his
stay in this mahal was unlucrative. In consequence, the Emperor
Aurangzeb wrote to Jafar Khan as follows: “I have sent to
you a lion, putting him ina cage. If he‘does not gét his food, he
is certain to give you trouble.” The aforesaid Nawab, who regarded
the stay of such a person to bea boon, remitted all the outstand-
ing revenue due from him, and made concession in view of the
suitable maintenance of his rank and station. The above Khan,
following the example of Jafar Khan, imprisoned all the zemindars
of that district, and did not omit any means of realising the
revenue. So that realising eighteen lakhs of rupees from those
mahals, he appropriated them to his own use, and day by day the
strength of his government and finances and of his army increased.
And making peace with the zemindars of the Mirang, he com-
menced to cut yungles and to bring them under cultivation Bring-
ing under cultivation half the wastes up to the foot of the moun-
tains of the Mirang, and placing it under his rule, he enlarged

his country and his resources. And Jafar Khan, seeing and hearing
of it, used to connive. At present, Purniah § is a large city, and the

DHAKAH (OR DACCA) alias JAHANGIRNAGAR!

This city is on the banks of the Budhigangaé, and the
Ganges, named Padmé, flows three karoh or kos distant from this
city. In past times 1+ was known by this name. During the
sovereignty of Nurn-d-din Muhammad Jahangir, the Emperor,
the city was called Jahangirnagar From that time till about
the end of the reign of Emperor Aurangzeb, this city was the

1 Dacca or Jahingirnagar was the Musalman Viceregal Capital of Bengal
dnring Mughul rule in India for a century, before it was shifted to Mursndabad
py Murshid Quli Khin in 1704AC In1610A C., Islim Khan, the Mnghul
Viceroy of Bengal, shifted the Viceregal Capital from Raymahal,or Akbarnagar,
to Dacca. This transfer of capital appears to have been decided npon, becanse
the Musalman dominions in Bengal had considerably extended eastward,
and Raymahal ceased to occupy a central position, and also becange Magh
and Ariacanese incursions from Arrakan had become frequent. To
effectually guard against the latter, a powerful fleet was constructed and main-
tained at Dacea and on the rivers Padda and Megna; and colonies of
Musalmin fendal barons (most of whom have now died out or sunk into
ploughmen) were planted throughout Eastern Bengal, especially at places
of strategic importance, in order to hold m check all disloyal Afghan ele.
ments, and to prevent their intriguing with the Magh raiders. Except for about
sixteen years, when Prince Shah Shuja re-transferred the Viceregal Capital to
Rajmahal, Dacoa remained the Viceregal Capital of Bengal throughout the
seventeenth century under three illnstrious Mughn!l Emperors, 213 , Jahangir,
Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb. The most notable amongst the Mughul
Viceroys of Dacoa were‘Islim Khén, Mir Jumla, the General of Aurangzeb,
and Shasata Khin (nephew of Empress Nir Jahan). The latter two Nawabs
are still remembered for their encouragement of architecture, and for their
construction of great public works conducive to the mateial improvement
of the people. Whilst the great achievement of the first was the breaking
of the last neck of Afghan opposition. The suburb of Dacca, it is related,
extended northwards for a distance of 15 miles, now covered with dense
jungles The muslin manufacture of Dacca, once so famous, has now nearly
died ont. The old fort, erected in the reign of Bmperor Jahangir, has dis-
appeared. The only old public buildings now remammng are the Katra, built
by Shih Shuji in 1645, and the palace of Lal Bagh, both of these also being in
ruins (See Taylor’s Topography of Dacca and Dr Wise’s History of Dacca).
Dacea, or Dhakka, occurs in the Akbaondmdh as an Imperial Thana in 1584
the mahal to which it belonged is named “ Dhakka Bazo;” it pertained in
those enrly days to Sarkar Baziiha, (See Ain-i-Akbari Jurrett’s Trans,, Vol 2;
Fase. 11, p 188). Dneca, though it has lost its former Viceregal magnificence
and opuience, has not yet sunk mto an ordinary Bengal town, by reason of
its being the remdence of the present liberal and pnbhie-spirited ‘ Nawibs

ISLAMABAD alias CHATGAON

Islamabad alias Chaitgion (Chittagong), from ancient times,
has been a large town, and its environs are forests of trees. It ig
south-east of Murshidabad on the seacoast, and in ancient times
it was a large port. The traders of every country—especially the
ships of the Christians—used to frequent it. But at present,
since Calcutta is a large port, all other ports of Bengal have fallen
into decay. It is said that ships which founder in other parts of
the sea re-appear in front of Chittagong; it rests with the nar-
rator to prove this. The ebb and flow of the sea occurs also here.
And the fighting-oocks of that tract are well known.

SARKAR BOGLA?

Sarkar Bagla was also a fort on the seacoast, and around it
was a forest of trees. And the ebb and flow of the sea also occurs
there, similarly to what occurs at other places on the seaside and
in the environs of Calcutta. In the twenty-ninth year of the acces.
sion to the throne of Emperor Akbar, one hour of the day was re-
maining, when a strange flood occurred, ‘in consequence of which
the whole town was submerged. The Rajah of that town, getting
on a boat, escaped. For five hours the fury of the storm, and
lightning and thunder, and tumult of the sea lasted. Two lakes of
human beings and cattle were engulfed in the sea of annihilation.

1 Chittagong was found to be in the hands of King Fakhruddin of Sunar.
gon about 1350 A.C, when Ibn-i-Batutah visited it. It was re-subdued by
King Nasrat Shah, son of Husain Shih, in the begmning of the sixteenth
century. In Todar Mal’s rent-roll, 1t is assessed at Rs. 285,607, and the
Sarkar is shown ag including seven mahals. During the struggle for supremacy
in Bengal between Afghans and Mughals in the seventeenth century, it tempor.
arily slipped out of Moslem hands, and had to be re-conquered in 1664 A.C. by
Nawab Shasta Khin, !mperor Aurangzeb’s Viceroy at Dacos, who named
it Islamabad (See the charming description of the re-conquest of Chitta-
gong, inthe dlamgirnamah, pp. 940-956 ) Chittagong was, from very early
times, an important place of trade, and the early Portuguese traders oflied it
“ Porto Grando.”

SECTION IV.—A BRIEF NARRATIVE OF THE RULE OF
THE RAIAN (ITHE HINDU CHIEFS), IN ANCIENT
TIMES, IN THE KINGDOM OF BENGAL.

Since by the landable endeavours of Bang, sonof Hind, the
dominions of Bengal were populated, Ins descendants, one after

tions, Tadagat-r-Nagiri, Tarikh-i-Firnz Shahi, Ain-1-Akbari, Badoani, Thomas’s
Imtual comage, Igbalnamah-t-Jahangir, Badshahnamah, and Alamgirnamah )

Before proceeding to the next section, it may be noted here that
our author has not described all the Sarkars or old Musalman admmistrative
divisions or districts of Bengal.

Bengal before Muhammadan conquest in 1198 A.C. consisted of five
Divisions, namely (1) Radha, the tract south of the Ganges and west of
the Hughli, (2) Bagdi, the delinic tract of the Ganges; (3) Banga, the
tract to the east, and beyond the delta; (4) Barendra, the tracts to the
noith of the Padda and between the Karatya and Mahananda rivers, and (5)
Mithila, the country west of the Mahananda (See Hamilton’s “ Hind stan ”),
These Divisions appear to have been under different Hindu Rajas «r petty
clmeftains, who had no cohesion amongst them, and were under no allegiance
to any central authority, and whose form of government was patriarchal
When Bakhtiar Khilji with eghteen troopers stormed Nadia, then the
Hinda capital of Bengal, and conquered Bengal, in 1198 A.O. (594 A.) he
appears to have conquered Mithila, Barendra, Radha, and theforth-western
portion of Bugdi. This tract was named Vilayet-1-Lakhnanti after 1ts capital,
Lakhnauti city Its extent 18 roughly desorbed in 1245 A O (641 AH ) in
the Tabagat-1-Nasu t, p, 162, when tts anthor Minhayjo-s-Siray, visited Lakhnauti.
Minhaj says that the Vilo,et-1-Lakhnauti les to both sides of the Ganges,
and consista of two wings, the eistern one 1s called Barendra, to which
Deokot belongs, and the western called Ral (Radha) to which Lakhnanti
belongs, that on one side the town of Lakhnanti 1s connected with
Deokot, and on the other side with Lakhnor by a causeway or em-
punked road, ten days’ distance. Deokot has been identified with an old
fort, now known simply as Damdamnh, on the left branch of the
Purnababa, south of Dinajpur, and close to Gangarampor. Bang or Hast
Bengal appears to have been subdned in 1214 A, C. (610 AH.) by Sultan
Ghiasuddin, an immediate successor of Bakhtiar Khilji (Tabagat, p. 168).
During the rule of the Independent Musalman Kinga of Bengal (1888 to 1538
A.C ), the extent of the kingdom of Bangala or Bengal was much more appar-
ently than what is described in the Ain-1-Akbari, and in the rent-roll of Bengall
prepared by Akbar’s Finance Ministers, Khweajah Muzaffar Ah and Todar Mall
in 1582 A.C.—(See J.A S., 1873, p. 254, Tabaqat-i-Nagiri and Tartkh-i-Firaz
Shahi, Thomas's ‘ Initial Coinage’), In Akbar's rent-roll, the following 19,
Sarkars are mentioned as composing the kingdom of Bengal Proper :—~

For a long period he held the sovereignty of Bengal. At length he
went to Delhi and was killed with Darjidhar *# in the wars of the

period of nearly 2,200 years. After that, the sovereignty passed

that year, Nawab Jafar Khin (Murshid Quii Khin) prepared hia ‘ Kimil
Jama’ Tamari’ or ‘ perfeot rent-roll,’ in which Bengal was divided into 34
Sarkara, forming 13 chaklahs, and subdivided into 1,660 perganas, with a revenue
of Re. 1,42,88,186. After the rule of Nawab Jafar Khan, Abwab revenue
(imposts as fees, &c.), appeared in the books In the time of Shuja Kban, Nawab
Jafar’s successor, the Abwabs (see Blochmann’s Contributions and Grant’s
report) amounted to Rs. 21,72,952, and they rapidly increased under Nawabs
Ali Vardi Khan and Kasim Khan, so that when the EI. Company in 1765
acquired the Dewent from Emperor Shih Alam, the net amount of all revenue
collected m Bengal Proper was (see Grant’s report) Rs. 2,66,24,223,

I respectfully differ, however, from Professor Blochmann’s conclasions on
one point. He would seem to snggest that the rbove oxtent of terntory with
the above Revenue, as gathered from Todar Mal’s rent-roll pri vared in 1582
and also from the Ain-1-Akbari, Iatalnamah, Padshahnamah and Alamgirnamah,
might be taken to represent the cerritorial and fiscal strength of the Musalmaon
Bengal kingdom of pre-Mughal tines —(J A S , 1878, p, 214), This mference
is vituated, in view of the fact that the Musalman Bengal kingdom in pre- Mughal
times included for the most part the whole of north Behar, and, under several
Musalman Bengal rulers, also sonth Behar os far westward os Sarkara
Mungher and Behar, besides Orissa. This consideration would indicate that
the territorial and finapgial strength of the Maosalman Bengal kingdom in
pre-Mughal times was greater than what is arrived at in Professor Bloch-
mann’s conclusions. In the din-t-Akbari, Orissa is incladed in the Sibah
of Bengal, Orissa consisting of 5 Sarkars. Thus, the Sibah of Bengal 18

Ain, Vol. II, p 129), Mutamad Khan who was attached to Emperor
Tuhangir’s Court, in his account of the seventh year of Jahangir’s reign, states
that the revenne of Bengal was one Kor and fifty lake in rupees.—(Vide

The fortune of sovereignty passed from his family also to Adisur’

ended. Sukh Sen,® of the Boido caste, became ruler, and after
ruling for three years over this kingdom, died. After this,
Ballal Sen, who built the fort of Gaur, occupied the throne
of sovereignty for fifty years, and died After this, Lakhman
Sen for seven years, after him Madhai Sen for ten years, after
him Kaisih Sen for fifteen years, after him Sada Sen for
eighteen years, and after him Nauj7 for three years ruled. When
the turns of these were over, Rajah Lakhmania,® son of Lakhman,
sat on the throne. At that time, the seat of government of the
Rais of Bengal was Nadiab,? and this Nadiah is a well-known
city, and a seat of Hindi learning. At present, though compared
with the past, it is dilapidated and in ruin, Still it is famous for its
learning. The astrologers of that place, who were known over the
world for their proficiency in astrology and ‘soothsayings, unitedly

at the time of delivery, informed Lakhmania’s mother, that at this
honr, an unlucky child would be born, who would bring about
bad lack and misfortune, and that if it be born after two hours, it
would succeed to the throne. This heroine ordered that both her
legs should be bound together, and she should be suspended with
her head downwards ; and after two hours she came down, and the
child was brought forth at the anspicious moment, but its mother
died. Rajah Lakhmania for eighty years occupied the throne.

In justice, he had no equal, and in liberality he had no match !

It is said that his gifts amounted to no less than one hundred

thousand Towards* the end of his life, when the perfection of the

period of his sovereignty approached decay, the astrologers of
that place said to Rajah Lakhmania: “ From our knowledge of
astrology, we have come to know, that shortly your sovereignty
would come toan end, and that your religion would cease to be
current in this kingdom.” Rai Lakhmania, not regarding this
prediction as truthful, put the cotton of neglect and ignorance in
his ear, but many of the elité of that city secretly moved away to
different places. And this prediction was fulfilled by the invasion
of Malik Ikhtiari-d-din Muhammad Bakhtiar Khilji, as will be
soon related hereafter.

AN ACCOUNT OF THE DOMINATION OF CERTAIN
HINDU RAIS OVER THE KINGDOM OF BENGAL,
AND OF THE CAUSE OF THE INTRODUCTION OF
IDOL-WORSBIP IN HINDUSTAN.

Be it not hidden that, in ancient times, the Rais of the Kingdom
of Bengal (Bangalah) were powerful, and of high rank and
dignity, and did not owe allegiance to the Maharajah of Hindi-
stan, who ruled over the throne at Delhi. For instance, Siiraj,?

1 This account is repeated in several Musalman histories, such as Tabaqut-
i-Naigri, Ferishta, Ain-i-Akbari. The Tabagat, p 151, being the nearest con-
temporary record, may be specially referred to, especially as its author,
Minhaju-s-Siraj, shortly after, in 641 A H. visited Lakhnanti. One lak cowre
is meant.

4 Minhaju-s-Siraj in the Tabaqat, pp 150 and 151, pays a high euloginm to
thie Rajéh, and extola hia virtues and liberality, and winds up by saying:
“May God lessen his panhmentin the next world!” ‘Verily, Minhaj was
himeelf liberal in his views!

8 In Ferishta (Per. text), Vol.1, p. 121, Bahdaj, father of Siraj, is described
as descended from Noah. It is worthy of note, that in the district of Monghyr,


--- Page 80 ---
53

who was a powerful Rajah, subjugated the Kingdom of Dakhin
(Dakii). At that time, his deputies commenced grasping and
usurping; and in the Kingdom of Hindustan, idol-worship dates
from his time. It is said that, in the beginning, Hind, having seen
and heard from his father Ham, son of Noah (pence be on him! )
devoted himself to the worship of God; and that his children also,
in the same manner, worshipped God, until, in the time of Rai
Mahiaraj,! a person coming from Persia perverted the people of
Hindistan to sun-worship. I ffluxen of time, some became star-
Worshippers, and others fire-worshippers. In the time of Rai
Siraj, a Brahmin, coming from the mountains of Jharkand, *
entered his service, and taught the Hindis idol-worship, and
preached that everyone preparing a gold or silver or stone image
of his father and grandfather, should devote himself to its wor-
ship; and this practice became more common than other practices.
And at the present day in the religious practice of Hindis, the
worship of idols, and of the sun, and of fireis very common. Some
say that fire-worship was introduced by Ibrahim Zardasht® in

on the southern bank of the Ganges, near Maulanagar, there 18 a town called
“ Sirajgarh, ” or “fort of Siraj.” Might not this place have been the birthplace
or seat of government of Rajah Siraj in the text? The locality 13 one which
would facilitate his excursion into the Dakhin through the defiles of the
Vindhya range, of which the text speaks

? This is apparently a mistake in the text for “ Rai Bahdaj,” who is men-
tioned in Ferishta as the father of Rai Siraj, and as a descendant of Noah.

3 We meet with the name of “Jharkand” in the “Akbarnamah” , it was
the Musalman appellation of “Chutia Nagpur” just as Bharkund was the
Mf&salman appellation of ‘ Sonthal Parganna.”

‘The Aryans must have fallen very low in the scale of spiritualism,
tg have needed lessons in religion from a preceptor hailing from Chutia Nagpir,
who was apparently a Dravidian or Sonthal Brahman.

This impringement of “spiritual light” from the defiles of Chatia Nagpir
tract, in the tame of Rajih Siraj, strengthens my surmise that Sirajgarh,
which is not far from Chutia Nagpir, was the home or 1esidence of Rajah
Siraj It may also be noted that the Sonthalese worship images of their
ancestors, which worship is referred to in the text.

8 Zadasht or Zartasht or |Zardahasht is the name of a person descended
from Manichahar, and a/disciple of Tythagorai. During the reign of Emperor
Gashtasp of Persia he claimed to be a prophet, and intioduced fire-woiship.
The Magians regard him as a prophet, and say that his name was Ibrahim,
and consider his book the Zend (or Zendavarta), as a revealed book, He ig
eupposed to have been the Zoroastor of the Greeks

the time of Gashtasp,! Emperor of Persia, and spread to Kabul
and Sistaén and throughout the empire of Persia, and that, in
process of time, the kingdom of Bengal became subject to the Rais
of Hindistan, and the Rais of Bengal paid revenue and sundry
tributes. After this, Shangaldip,? emerging from the environs
of Koch,® became victorious over Kidar, and founded the city of
Gaur, and made it the seat of government, and for a period ruled
over the Kingdom of Bengal and the whole empire of Hindistan.
When Shangaldip collected four thousand elephants, one lak
cavalry, and four Inks of infantry, the breeze of insolence wafted
in the recesses of his bram, and he ccased to pay tribute to the
Emperors of Persia,* as was hitherto the practice with the Rais of
Hindistau. Aud when Afrasiab* deputed some one to demand
the tribute, he rebuked and insulted him Afrasiab flew into
rage, and despatched his General, Piran-visah, with fifty thousand

1 Gashtasp or Keshtab was the Daring Ilystaspns of the Greeks, and
belonged to the Kaman dynasty; his son, Isfandiar, was the Xerxes of the
Greeks, and his grandson, Bahman, was the Artaxerxes Longimanus of the
Greeks. (See Namah-t-Khusruan, p. 59).

2 In Ferishta, ‘‘ Shangaldip’’ is called “ Shangal,’? and so in the text in
another place. In Ferishta (Persian text), Vol. 2, p. 288, the following
account of Shangaldip or Shangal appears: “ Shangal, towards the close
of the reign of Rajih Kedar Brahman, emorging from the environs of Koch
(Koch Behar) won a victory over Kedar, and founded the City of Lakhnauti,
which is otherwise known as Gaur. Shangal mobihzed a force of four thousand
elephants, one lak cavalry, and five lak infantry, and stopped paying tribute to
Afrasiab, the King of Tiran or Tartary or Scythia. Becoming enraged,
Afrasiib deputed his generalissimo, Piran-Visah, with fifty thousand cavalry,
to chastise Shangal.” The rest of the account of Ferishta tallies with that
in the text.

8 Kuch Behar used to be known in early daya asthe traot of the “Koch
tmbe” or simply as “ Koch.”

+ “Tyan” or Persia, here in the text 18 evidently a mistake for “ Tira ” or
Tartary or Scythia, of which Afrisiab was monarch, This indicates the
subjection of India (like Persia) to the Scythians at a remote period,

6 Aframab (conqueror of Persia) was an ancient king of Tiran or Tartary
or Scythia. He was a Mongol by birth, He conquered Persia, killed Nazar
with his own hand, and reigned there for about twelve years, about seven
centuries before the Christian era, but was subsequently driven beyond the
Oxus by » famous chief called Zalzar. Afrisiib again overran Persia,
but was at last defeated and slainin Arzibijin by Zalzar and his celebrated son,
Rustam, the Persian Hercules, Afrasiiyab appears, however, to have been &
family surname, like the Pharaoshs, the Ptolemys, the Czsars.

Mongols, thirsty for blood. In the mountains of Koch, near the
limits of Ghoraghat, in Bengal, an engagement took place; for
two days and nights the fighting continued. Althongh the Mon-
gols displayed deeds of hravery, and put to the aword fifty thousand
of the enemy, yet owing to the overwhelming numbers of the
Indian army, they could effect nothing The Mongols also lost
eighteen thousand of their numbers, and on the third day,
seeing symptoms of defeat on the forehead of their condition,
they retreated. And as the Indian army was victorious, and
the Mongol’s country was distant, the Mongols gave up fighting,
and retiring into the mountains, secured a strong place, where they
entrenched themselves, and sent to Afrasiab an account narrating
the state of things. At that time, Afrasiéb waa in the town of
Gangdozh, which is situate midway between Khata and China,
and 1s distant a month’s journey on the other side from Khanba,
ligh ! On the simple receipt of the account, and being apprised
of the state of things, he marched swiftly to the aid of the Mongols,
with one lak chosen cavalry. And at a time, when Shangal,
summoning together the Rais of the surrounding countries, was
pressing the siege hard against Piran, and was about to put all to
the sword, he ( Afrésiab) attacked him on the way. The Hindis,
on the first onslaught, losing heart and feeling paralysed, dispersed,
like the constellation of the bear. Piran, relieved from the
anxiety of the siege, paid his obeisance to Afrisiéb, Af:asiab
threw down on the soil of annihilation as many of the Hindu
army a8 he could. And Shangal with the remnants being
vanquished, retreated to the town of Lakhnanuti, and owing to
the pursuit of Afrasiab, could not prolong his stay at Lakhnaati
more than a day, and took refuge in the hills of Tirhfit. And
the Mongols, ravaging the Kingdom of Bengal, spared no trace
of fertility. And when Afrasiab planned an expedition towards the
hills of Tirhit, Shangal begged forgiveness for his misbehaviour
through wise envoys, and presented himself before Afrimib with
a sword anda winding-sheet, and prayed for leave to go to the
country of Tarin. Afrasi&b, being pleased, bestowed the Kingdom
of Bengal and the whole empire of Hindistén on Shangal’s son,
and carried Shangal in his company, and in the battle of Hama-

waran Shangal was killed at the hands of Rustam.! And in the
reign of Rajah Jaichand,* owing to whose neglect, decay had over-
taken several provinces of Hindiistén, and for years Hindistan
did not see its normal state, ruin was visible over the whole empire
ofIndia. At that time, certain Rajihs of Bengal, finding an oppor-
tunity, and grasping at domination, became independent. And
when Fir (Porus),? who was a relation of the Rajah of Kumayin,'
emerged, he first subjugated the province of Kumiyiin, and then
capturing in battle Rajah Dahli, brother of Jaichand, who had
founded Dehli,’ subjugated Kaniij, and after tlis he marched with
his force towards Bengal, and brought it to his subjection, up to
the confines of thesea. And this Porns is he, who was killed at the

Inasmuch as the object of the author is to chronicle the history
of the Musalman sovereigns, therefore, not busying himself with
the details of the affairs of the Hindi Rais, he reins back the
graceful steed of the black pen of wnting from striding this valley,
and gives it permission to canter towards relating and recitmg the
details of the history of the Muhammadan rulers and sovereigns.

that Indis and Bengal im very early times had political connectiun of some
sort with Scythia and (through the latter ) with Persia Itis probable that

CHAPTER I.

A DESCRIPTION OF THE RULE OF THE MUSALMAN
RULERS WHO RULED OVER THIS KINGDOM OF

BENGAL, AS VICEROYS OF THE EMPERORS OF
DELHI!

Be it not hidden from the enlightened hearts of those who
enquire into the histories of Musalman sovereigns and rulers,
that the commencement of the effulgence of the sun of the
Muhammadan faith in the Kingdom of Bengal, dates from the
period of the reign of Sultan Qutbu-d-din Aibak,* Emperor of

1 This period extended from 1198 A.C. to 1338 A.C.

% This is not quite accurate. Bengal was conquered by Bakhtiar Khnlj-al-
Ghazi (Tabagat-+-Nasir1, p. 146), in 594 A.H. or 1198 A.C, (for the discusmon
of the date, see Tabagat, p. 150, and Blochmann’s contribution to history of
Bengal), whilst Emperor Shahabuddin Ghori alias Muizuddin Muhammad
Sam was yet ahve, and whilst Qntbnddm Aibak ruled at Delhi, as the
latter’s Indian Viceroy, that is, only 7 years after the Musalmen occupation
of Delhi, which took place in 587 AH. or 1191 A.C. (Tabagat, pp
139, 140 and 128). He was called “ Aibak,” becanse hig little finger was
feeble or paralyzed (Tabagat, p. 138), whilst according to another account,
“Aibak” sigmfied the “brilhant chief.’ His name 1s preserved in
his Capital by the Qntb mosque and by the Qatb Minar, though these were
erected to commemorate other more or less forgotten worthies. Bakhtiar
Ehnlji in the firat instance conquered Bengal on his own imtiative, though he
acknowledged the nommal suzerainty of Shahabaddin and subsequently
of Quibaddin, when the latter mounted the throne of Delhi (Tabagat, p. 140).
That this was so, appears from the circumstance that in the list of Malika
and Suljins under Shahabuddin alas Muizu-d-din contained in Tabagat
(pp. 146 and 187), Bakhtiar is assigned a co-ordinate position with Qutbuddin.
In this connection, 16 is worth noting that owing to a popular and common
fallacy, these early pre-Mughul Moslem rulers of India have been described
as ‘ Pathan rulera of India,’ As pointed ont by Major Raverty m his trans-
lation of Tabaqat-i-Nasixi, yeither the Ghoris, nor thew slaves, “ the Slave-
kings of ‘Dellu,” nor the Tughluks, nor the Khiljis were Afghana or
* Pathans,’ but that they were all Turkish tribes. (See also Tabagat-i-Nagiri,
p. 150, where the expression “ Turkén ” oy ‘Turks’ is constantly employed,
with reference to the first Musalman conquerors of Behar and Bengal).


--- Page 86 ---
59

Delhi. And the origin of the title “Aibak” ig that his little finger
was feeble; hence he was called ‘ Aibak.’ When: Sultén Qutbu-
d-din im 590 A.H. wrested by force the fort of Kol from the
Hindus, and captured one thousand horses and an immense
booty, the news spread that Sultan Mui'zu-d-din Muhammad Siam,
alao called Sultén Shababu-d-din, had planned expeditions for
the conquests of Kaniij and Baudras. Sultan Qutbu-d-din
marched forward from Kol to receive him, presented to him the
booty of Kol with other valuables, and becoming recipient of a
special Khila’t, formed the vanguard of the imperial forces, and
marched ahead And engaging in battle with the forces of the
Rajeh of Banaras, he routed them, and at length, slaying on the
battle-field Rajah Jaichand, the Rajah of Banaras, he became vic-
torious. Sultén Shahabu-d-din, marching with a force from the
rear, moved up and entered the city of Banaras, and pillaging
the whole of that tract up to the confines of Bengal, carried off
as booty incalculable treasures and jewels The Sultan then re-
turned to Ghami. And the Kingdom of Bengal as an adjunct
of the Empire of Delhi, was left in the hands of Qutbu-d-din.
Sultan Qutbu-d-din entrusted to Malik Ikhtiaru-d-din Muham-
mad Bakhtiar Khilji the Viceroyalty of the Provinces of Behar
and Lakhnauti.. Muhammad Bakhtiar, who- was one of the

According to the ‘ Magalik-ul-Mumahk,’ says Major Raverty in an article in
A.S.J. for 1875, No. 1, p. 37, “the Khalj are a tribe of Turks which in former
times settled in Garmair, between Sijistan and the region of Hind, They ate
in appearance and dress lke Turks, and observe the customs of that race»
and all speak the Turkish language.” The Khaljs or Khiljis haye been by
several writers erroneously confounded with the Afghan tribe of “ Ghalzs "’
or * Ghilys.? ‘Uhe first Afghan or ‘ Pathan’ who sat on the throne of Delhi-
was Sultan Bahlal of the Lodi tribe, the thirtieth Musalman ruler of India,
counting from Qutbuddm ‘Aibak.

1 It is worthy of note that in the times of Bakhtiir Khilji and his imme-
diate successors, South Behay was included in the Bengal or Lakhnaut
Viceroyalty South Behar was separated from the Bengal Viceroyalty in
622 H. by Emperor Altamsh who placed it undera distinct governor, named
Alauddin Jani On withdrawal of the Emperor, Behar was again annexed
by the Bengal ruler, Ghiasuddm (see Tubaqat-1-Nasiri, p. 163). It continued
to be a part of the Bengal Kingdom till 1820, when Emperor Ghiasuddin
Tughlak again separated it. Behar belonged to the Sharg? Kingdom of
Jaunpur from 1397 A.C , agam under Ibrahim, Bahadur Khan, son of
Governor Darya Khan, assumed independence in Behar, with the title of
Shih Muhathmad, and about 1498 A.C. or about 903 A.H. Sonth Behar

chiefs of Ghor! and Garmsir, was a brave man, well-built and
very strong In the beginning, he was in the service of Sultan
Shababu-d-din Ghori at Ghazni. He was allowed a small
allowance, as neither he was externally prepossessing, nor was his
appearance grand. Becommng despondent, Muhammad Bakhtiar
came to Hindustan in the company of the Sultan, stayed behind,
and did not even then get into the good graces of the Ministers
of Hindustan. Departing thence, he went to Burdawon' to
Anghal Beg who was the ruler over the Doab country, and there
gaining in eminence, he advanced himself to the exalted office of
generalissimo. And the tract of Kambalah* and Betali was
given to him as a gdgir. From there he went in the service of
Malik Hassama-d-din® to the Subah of Audh (Oude). Subduing

again became more or less subject to the Musalman Kings of Gaur, Husain
Shah and Nasrat Shih. Under the early Mughul Emperors, Behar was again
formed mto a distinct Sibah, but under the later Mughule, 16 again
became incorporated along with Orissa in the great Bengal Viceroyalty.
North Behar appears to have been generally included in the Musalman
Kingdom of Bengal (see Tarskh-1-Fuuz Shahi, pp 451 and 586).

I Abil Fazl places ‘Ghor’ to the north uf Kandahar, and ‘Garmmr’ to the
west of Kandahar. In ‘Garmpir’ lay the city of Ferozkoh, the capital of the
Ghorian Sultins.

3 Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, (Pers. text, p. 146) which 18 the nearest contemporary
accounts, describes Bakhtiar Khilii as “ active, agile, brave, bold, learned and
intelligent.” It says that he went to Ghazni to seek service under Sultin
Muizuddin, but owing to his slender appearance was rejected by the Sultin’s
War Minister. Disappointed, Bakhtiar came te Delhi, where also he was
rejected by the War Minister t (Dewan-i-‘Ars).

8 In Tabaqat-i-Nasiri p. 147, which is the most rehable account, ‘ Badaon.’
The Tabagqat mentions ke name of the ‘eudatery of Badaon to be Stpasalar
Hazbaru-d-din Hasan Arnab.

4 Major Raverty identifies Bakhtigr Kai? 8 jager lands with the parganahs
of ‘Bhagwat and Bhoili,’ south of Benaras, and east of Chiinargarh{ Professor
Blochmann considers this identification satinfactory. (See Raverty’s transla-
tion of Taubanat-i-Nasis and Blochmann’s contr. to history and Geography
of Bengal).

§ This account does not accord strictly with what is contained in the
Tabagat-i-Namm, (Pers. text, p. 147), the nearest contemporary account for
the period. In Tabaqat, it is stated that after being rejected by War Ministers
both at Ghazni and at Delhi, owing to his slonder appearance, Bakhtiar
Khilji procesded to Badaon, presented himself before its feudal baron,
general Haybaru-d-din Hassan Arnab, who allotted him a fixed pay, that
thence Bakhtiir proceeded to Ondh and presented himself beforé its feuda!

that province, he advanced himself further in rank and dignity.
When the fame of his bravery and liberality, and the reputation of
his heroism and gallantry, spread over the confines of Hindustan,
Sultan Qutbu-d-din who, not yet ascending the throne of Delhi,
was still at Lahor, sent to him valuable Thild’t, and summoned
him to his presence, and granting to him an iWlumimated Farman of
Chiefship over the province of Behar, deputed him there. And
Muhammad Bakhtiér marching quickly to that side, spared no
measure of slaughter and pillage. It is said that in Behar there
was a Hindi Library which fell into the hands of Muhammad
Bakhtiar. The latter enquired from the Brahmins as to the reason
for the collection of the books, The Brahmins replied that the
whole town formed a college, and that in the Hindi language a
college was called Behar, and that hence that town was so called.
After this, when Muhammad Bakhtiar bemg victorious! ,eturned.
to the service of the Sultan, he became more 1enowned and
enviable than other servants And his 1ank was advanced so
much, that the juice of envy set aflowing amongst Sultan Qutbu-
d-din’s other officers, who burned in the fire of envy and shame, and
combined to expel and destroy him, so much so, that one day m
the presence of the Sultan, in regard to his strength and prowess,
they said unanimously that Muhammad Bakhtiar, owiag to exuber-
ance of strength, wanted to fight with an elephant. The Sultan
wondering questioned him. Muhammad Bakhtiar did not disavow
this false boastfulness, though he knew that the object of the
associates of the king was to destroy him. In short, one day when
all the people, the elité as well as the general public, assembled in

baron, Malik Hassamuddin Ughalbak, who conferred on him fiefs of Sablat
and Sahl: (identihed with Bhagwat and Iinoel:), and finding him brave and
bold sent him (apparently on reconnoitering expeditions) towards Mumr near
Patna, and Behar town In these reconnoitermg expeditions for one or two
yeats, Bakhuar gatheed a large booty, when the Delhi Viceroy (Qutbuddin)
recognized tardily Bakhuar’s merits, Tt would thus appear that bat for,
Bakhtia.’s own tenacity, the stupidity of the War ministers of Ghaznin and
Delh: would have robbed the Indo- Moslem Empire of a valuable 1ecrut, and
perhaps postponed indefinitely its rapid expansion towards Behar and Bengal '

1 In Tabaqat-1-Nagit, pp. 147 and 148 at 18 stated that Bakhtid: presented
himself before the gate of the fort of Behar with two hundred horse-girthe
and armonrs covered with far-cloth (ff {pind _y’), und stormed the fort, and

that Bakhtiar had with him at the time two wise brothers, named Nuzamnud-
din and Samsamuddin (of Farghana)

Darbar, a white rogue elephant was brought to the White Castlo
(Qasr-1-Sufed). Muhammad Bakhtiér tying up the loin of his
garment ou the waist, came out to the field, struck the elephant’s
trunk with a mace, when the elephant ran away roaring. All the
spectators, mcluding those assembled, and the envious, raising
shouts of applause to the sky, were confounded The Sultan
bestowing on Malk Muhammad Bakhtiar special Khila’t and
many gifts, ordered the nobles to bestow on him presents, so that
all the nobles gave him numerous largesses Muhammad Bakhtiar,
in the same assembly, adding his own quota to all the largesses,
distributed the same amongst those present. In short, at this
time, the Viceroyalty of the Kingdoms of Behir and Lakhnauti
was bestowed on him, and with peace of mind, having gained
his object, he proceeded to the metropolis of Delhi. That year!
Mahk Bakhtiar, bringing to subjugation the Sibah of Behar, en-
gaged in introducing administrative arrangements, and the second
year coming to the Kingdom of Bengal, he planted military out-
posts in every place, and set out for the town of Nadiah, which at
that time was the Capital of the Rajahs of Bengal. The Rajah of
that place, whose name was Lakhmania, and who had reigned for
éighty years over that Kingdom, was at the time taking his food?

1The second year after his conquest of Behar, Bakhtiar Khulji set ont for
Bengal, stormed Nadia, and conquered Bengal. I'vciefore, the conquest of
Behar took placo m 592 A.H. or 1196 A.C,

The text ia not strictly in accord with the account given in the Tabagat-1-
Nagir: which xs the most reliable and the nearest contemporary account for
the period. Whulst in the service of the feudatory of Oudh (Tabagat, Pers.
text, p. 147), Bakhtiar reconnoitered Behar for one or two years, and carried off
much plunder. Qutb-u-din, the Delhi Viceroy, then called Bakhtidr to Lahore
tardily recognized his merits, and londed him with presents Bakhtiar re-
turned to Behar, and conquered it, aud carrying off again a large booty,
presented himself to Qatb-u-din at Delhi, where he had to undergo a gladia-
torial ordeal at the White Castle (Qasr-1-Sufed of Delhi), and then receiving
presents from Qutb-u-din, retarned to Behar, and the second yearafter his
conquest of Behar, he invaded and conquered Bengal, storming and sackmg
Nadia, and establishing himself at the willage ur mouza of Lakhnauta (Tabagat-
a-Nagut, p. 151) This would indicate that Lakhnauti was founded by him,
and was distinet from Gaur, though possibly close to it.

%The Tabagat (Pers. text, p. 151) states that the Rajah (Lakhmanin) wag
then sitting in his inner apartments, with his food set before him in gold and
silver plates, when the saddon inrysh of Bakktidr Khilji with cighteen troopers,
struck terror, end the Rajah ran out bare-foot by a back-door, and fled to

Suddenly, Muhammad Bakhtiar, with eighteen horsemen, made
an onslaught, so that before the Rajih was aware, Bakhtiar burst
inside the palace, and unsheathing from the scabbard his sword that
lightened and thundered, engaged in fighting, and put the harvest
of the life of many to his thundoring and flashing sword Rajah
Lakhmania getting confounded by the tumult of this affair, left be-
hind all his treasures and servants and soldiers, and slipped out
bare-foot by a back-door, and embarking on a boat, fled towards
Kamrip! Muhammad Bakhtiar sweeping the town with the broom
of devastation, completely demolished it, and making anew the city
of Lakhnauti, which from ancient times was the seat of Gov-
ernment of Bengal, his own metropolis, he ruled over Bengal
peacefully, introduced the Khutbah, and minted com in the
name of Sultén Qutbu-d-din, and strove to put in practice
the ordmances of the Mu'iammadan religion® From that

Tabaqat {Pers text, p 150), m connection with the previous flight from Nadiah
of Brahmans and Sahas who hearing of Bakhtiir’s prowess and of his con-
quest of Behar, anticipated Bakhiair’s invamon of Bengal, and had advised
the Rajah to shift with all his troops and people from Nadiah to his residence
in East Bengal (at Bikrampur). The astrologers had also prepared the Rajah
for Bakhtiar’ conquest But the Rajah was deaf to all advice, whilst tho
Brahmans a.d Sahas had fled. It 1s opposed to the probablities of the case
that the subsequent defeat of the Rajah by eighteen troopers of Bakhtiar was
brought about by any foul play or stratagem from one side or the other,
because the Rajah was a good, noble and generons prince, and the 1dol of his
people, and even the Musalman historian (author of the Tabaqat-1-Nasiri)
pays him a glowing tribute. (See Tabagat, p. 149)

came back to Bengal, and for a period ruling over Bengal le
engaged in demolishing the temples and in building mosques.

this town was founded hy Emperor Garshésp* Facing that
town, flows a river called Namakdi, which in its depth and
breadth, 1s thrice as much as the river Ganges. Since that river
was tumultons, bioad, and deep, and fordable with difficulty,
marching along the banks of the rnver for ten days,' he reached
a place where existed a large bridge’ made of stone, and extending
over twenty-nine arches, erected by the ancients, It is said that

that bridge, and came to the country of Kamrip In short,

for along time the boundary between ancient Muhammadan Bengal and
Kamrip.

4 This ten days’ march extended northward along the banks of the Karatya
and the Teesta, which latter before 1784 flowed wert of the Karatya, jomed the
Atrai, and fell into the Padma, and of all Bengal rivers extended furthest into
Tibbat. Thig march then was along the frontier between ancient Mugalnian
Bengal and the territory of the Rajah of Kamriip. Beakhtiir’s Tibbatan

Mahammad Bakhtiar sending across his forces by that bridge, and
posting two commandanis for its protection, planned to advance.
The Rajah of Kamiup, dissuading him from an advance, said that
if he (Muhammad Bakhtiér) weuld postpone his march to Tibbat
that year, and next year collecting an adequate force would
advance townids it in full strength “I too would be the pioneer
of the Moslem force, and would tighten up the waist of self-sacri-
fice.” Muhammad Bakhtiar absolutely unheeding this advice,
advaneed, and after sixteen days,! reached the country of Tibbat,
The battle commenced with an attack on a fort which had been
built by king Garshasp, and was very strong. Many of the
Moslem force tasted the lotion of death, and nothing was gained.
And from the people of that place who had been taken prisoners, it
was ascertained that at a distance of five farsung from that fort,
was a large and populous city? Fifty thousand Mongolian
cavalry thirsty for blood and archers were assembled in that city.
Every day m the market of that city, nearly a thousand or five
hundred Mongolian horses sold, and were sent thence to Lakhnauti.8
And they said “you have an impracticable scheme in your head
with this small force.” Muhammad Bakhtiar, becoming apprised
of this state of affairs, became ashamed of his plan, and, withont
attaining his oud, retreated. And since the inhabitants of those
environs, setting fire to the fodder and food-grains, had removed
their chattels to the ambuscades of the rocks, at the time of this
retreat,* for fifteen days, the soldiers did not see a handful of
food-grains, nor did the cattle see one bushel of fodder.

4 iu the Tabagat-i-Nogin (Pers. text, p. 158), this march is thug related.
* After leaving a Turkish officer and a Khilji officer with a large body of troops
to guard the bridge... .. Muhammad Bakhtiar Khilji with his army for fifteen
days marched across high hills and low defiles, and on the sixteenth day (from
bia march from the bridge) descended into the open plain of Tibbat, and
passed many populous villages, .,...and after some eight hours’ hard fighting,
entrenched himeelf in a fort there.”

& The Tabaqat-i-Nagui names the city Karmbatan. Bakhtiir Khalji’s march
from the bridge was northward for mxteen days,

Neither human beings saw any bread except the circular diso
of the sun,
Nor did the cattle see any fodder except the rainbow !

From excessive hunger the soldiers devoured tlesh of horses
and horses preferring death to life placed their necks under their
daggers. In short, in this straitened condition, they reached the
bridge. Since those two commendants quarrelling with cuch other
had deserted their posts at the head of the bridge, the people of
that country had destroyed the bridge. At the sight of this des-
truction, the heart of the high and the low suddenly broke, like
the Chinese cup. Muhamread Bakhtiar engulphed in the sea of
confnoion and perplexity, despaired of every resource. After
much striving, he got news that in the neighbourhood there was a
very large temple,! and that idols of gold and sil\er were placed
there in great pomp. It is said that there was an idol in the
temple which weighed a thousand maunds In short, Muhammad
Bakhtiar with his force took refuge im this temple, and was busy
improvising means for crossing the river. - The Rajah of Kim-
rip? had ordered all his troops and subjects ot that country
to commit depredations, The people of that country, sending out
force after force, engaged in besieging the temple, and from
all sides posting in the ground bambou-made lances, and tying
one to the other, turned them into the shape of walls. Muhammad
Bakhtiar saw that all chance of escape was shipping out of lis
hands, and that the knife was reaching the bone, so at once with
his foice sssuing out of the temple and making a sortie, he broke
through the stockade of bamboos, and cutting through his way,
vescued himself from the hard-pressed siege. The infidels of that
country pursued him to the banks of the river, and stretched their
hands to plunder and slaughter, so that some by the sharpness of
the sword and others by the inundation of water, were engulphed
in the sea of destruction. The Musalman soldiers on reaching the
river-banks stood perplexed. Suddenly, one of the soldiers
plunged with luis horse into the river, and went about one arrow-
shot, when another soldier seeing this, plunged, similarly into the
river. As the river had a sandy bed, with a little movement, alt

were drowned. Only Muhammad Bakhtidy with one thousand
cavalry (and according to another ace ant, with three hundred
cavalry) succeeded in crossing over;! the rest met with a watery
grave. After Muhammad Dakhtidr had crossed safely over the
tumultous river with a small force, from excessive rage and
humiliation, in that the females and the children of the slanghtered
and the drowned from alleys and terraces abused and cursed him,
he got an attack of consumption, and reaching Deokot? died.
And according to other accounts, ‘Ali Mardin Khilji, who was one
of his officers, during that iHIncss, slew Bakhtiar, and raised the
standard of sovereignty over the <ingdom of Lakhnanti, The
period of Malik Ikhtiaru-d-din, Muhammad Bakhtiay's rule over
Bengal was twelve years. When Muhammad Bakhtiar passed?

successfally swam across the river with only one hundred troopers, whilst all
the rest of his army were drowned.

tious 602 A. ax the date of Bakltidy’s assassination, but he accepts 504

coutradiction,

Mr. Thomas in hia “Initial Coinage of Bengal” states that Ali Mardin
assumed independence uncer the title cf Alauddin when Qutbuddin Aibak
Gied in Lahore in 607 A.H. Thus allowing 8 months for Malik Azuddin’s
rule, Bakhtiar Khilji appears to have been assassinated about the middle
of 606 A.H.—the date previously atvived at by me.

In Badaoni, it is stated that Muhammad Bakhtiar Khilji returned to
Deokot from “Tibbat with only some three. hundred troopers, the
rest of his expeditionary force having perished, and fell ill from vexarion,
and was attacked with hectic fever, and used to say “no doubt Sulfin

RULE OF ‘ALI MARDAN KHILJI IN BENGAL,

After the avsassination of ‘Azz-ud-din, his assassin, ‘Ali Mardan
Khilji beeame ruler of Bengal, styled himself Sultan ‘Alau-d-din,

hm with one blow of a dagger: The above account is rendered thus by
the Tabigat-1-Nisin, the nearest contemporary account, (Pet> test, 1 p
166) —When Bakhtiar Khiji with abont one hundied tioopery only made
good his escape across the mver, ‘Ali Mach with his relatives iendered good
services, and conducted Bakhtiar Khilji towards Deokot. On arial at
Deokot, fiom excessive homnihation Bakhtin fell ill and shnt himself up,
and aid not ride out in the streets, for whenever he cid so, widows and
orphans of the soldiers and officers that had fallen, used to cmse and abnse
him fiom the tc:aces and the staeets Bakhtiia wonld say “ Some mishap
must have befallen Snitan Muizaddin, fo. the tide of fortune fu have
thus turned agamst me” And it was a fact, tor ai tha! time Sultin Suz.
uddiu had fallen at the hands of an assassin (a Ghakha:). Fiom excessive
homthation, Muhammad Bakhtiar Khiljyi fell ill and was confined to his
bed, and at length died. And according to another account, one of lus ofhcers
‘Ali Mardin Khilji who was bold and ferocions, and held the fief of Deokot,
on hearing the news of Bakhttir’s sllness, came to Deokot, fuund hmm lying
in bed, threw aside the sheet from his face, and slew him.”

1 Fis name was Mahk ‘Azuddin Mohammad Shiim Khilji (Tabaqat-

year 607 AH., Sultan Qutbu-d-din, whilst playing at polo at

Deokot) from Bakhtiar Khilji, went ahead to receive Qaimaz Rimi, and
in the latter's company proceeded to Deokot, and on the imtiative of
Qaimaz, received the hef of Deokot. When Qaimaz was returning from
Deokot, Muhanimad Shirin and other Khilji nobles collected together, and
attempted to re-take Deokot. Qeimasz came back, fought with the Khilji
nobility and Muhammad Shian, who being defeated, dispersed, quarrelled
anonget themselves near Makidah (Masidah, a perganah south-east of Deo-
kot) aud Mantosh (Santosh, a perganah south-east of Deokot), and
Muhammad Shirin was slam, He hes buried at Santosh (on the banks of
the Atri: river).

1 “Ah Mardan Khilji, assassinof Bakhtiar Khilji’and Azuddin Khilji, ruled
from 607 A.H. to 609 or 610 A.H. and assumed independence and title of
Saltan ‘ Alauddin, on the death of Qutba-d-din Aibak. In Tabayat-i-Nagiri it
is stated that he recited the Khutbah ; but Badaoni states that he minted also
coins in hisown name [I have not yet seen any of bis coins. Mr. Thomas
in his ‘Tnitial Comage of Bengal’’ notices the coins of Abauddin’s successor,
Ghiagnddin, stuck in A H. 616, see J.A.8., p. 354, p 1, Vol. XLII for 1873].
It is also stuted in Tabaqat-i-Nasiri (Pers text, p. 159), that from excessive
imsolence, he divided the country of Irin and Tiirin amongst his adherents,
and no one dared to suggest that £.0se dominions did not pertain to him.
Qne person complained of pove.ty to Alanddin, who enqmred whence he

wnite out a document assigning lands in Ispahan to him !

It 1g stated in Tabagit, that on escape from the custody of the Kotwal
of Narkot:, Ali Mardin went to Sultan Qutbu-d-din, and received the Vice-
royalty of Lakhnanti. When he crussea the Kosi river, Hussamaddin from
Deokot received him, conducted him to Deokot, where Ali Mardan “was

Lahor, fell from his horse, and died, and his son, Aram Shah,
mounted the throne of Delhi, and the Empire fell into decay.
Ghidgu-d-din establishing completely his rule over this province,

pointed to fief of Kangor, (which lay south-east of Deokot) and next
promoted to charge of the important northern mulitary outpost of
Deokot. On the appointment of Ah Mardan Khilj: to the rule of Bengal,
he advanced to receive the new Viceroy on the banks of the Kos river,
and helped in the latter's installation at Deokot On the assassination
by the Khilj: nobles of Al: Mardan, who had since the death of Emperor
Qutbnddin Aibak assumed independence, Hussamuddin was elected
chef of the Khuilji oligarchy in Bengal in 609 or 610 A.H. Seeing the
feebleness of Qutbuddm’s successor, Aram Shih, Hussamu-d-din assumed
independence, made Lakhnani: his capital, and assumed the title of
Sultan Ghifisu-d-din about 612 A.H., and minted coins in his own name.
Mr. Thomas in his “Initial Comage of Bengal’ notices several coins of
Sultin Ghiasu-d-din strack at Gaur or Lakhnanti: between 614 and 620
A.H, An exammation of thesecoins indicates the interesting and curious
fact that Ghiisu-d-din had put himself im communication with the Khalifa
of Baghdad go far back as 620 A.H. (that 2s, earlier than Emperor Altamsh
of Delhi who obtained similar honour 1n 626 AH.) and obtained a
pontificiul patent, recogaizing the sovereign of Bengal amongst the
Moslem hierarchy of the world. This circumstance, as suggested by
Mr. Thomas, would also indicate that in those days there was freer sea
and ocean-intercourse between the Musalmans along the shoves of Bengal
and the Arebs of the sea-ports of Basrah and Baghdad, than between
Musalmans of more inland places in India and the Arabs of the aforesard sea-
ports. .
In 622 A.H., Emperor Altamsh from Delhi mvaded Bengal, and on
Sultan Ghiagnddin paying him tribute, peace was concladed. In 624 A.H,
Sultan Nasiraddin, eldest son of Emperor Altamsh, invaded Lakhnauti,
whilst Ghiisuddin was engaged at Kamrup and Bang (Bast Bengal), and
fought a battle with Sultin Ghrignddin, on the latter’s return, and’
killed the latter, and succeeded to the rule over Bengal m a semi-sovereign
capacity, with the approval of hig father, Emperor Altamsh. It is stated
that Salpin Ghiiguddin extended ahd consohdated the Moslem sovereignty
in Benga:, and extended Ins empire over Jajynagar (Orissa), Bang (East
Bengal), Kamrad (or Kamrup, Western Assam}, and Tirhut (see Tabaqat.
i-Nasiri, Pers, text, p. 168.) Minhajas-Siraj, Author of Tabaqat-i-Nagirl who

RULE OF ‘ALAU-D-DIN KHAN.

When Sultan Shamsu-d-din Altamsh heard the news of the
death of his beloved son, he observed the necessary ceremonies
of mourning, and in the year 627 A. H. for the purpose of qnench-
ing the fire of insurrection which had appeared in Bengal, after
the death of Nagirn-d-din, proceeded to Lakhnanti, and after
fighting with Malik Hussamu-d-din Khilji, who raising ingarrec-
tion had brought about complete disorder in the government of
Bengal, captured him, After weeditg out the root of insurrec-
tion, and quelling the tumult of rebellion, he assigned the rale
of that kingdom to Izgul-mulk Malik ‘ Alau-d-din Khan.’ And
the latter devoting himself to the subjugation and administration
of the country enforced in this country the Imperial Khutbah and
coin. After ruling three years, he was recalled.

RULE OF 1ZZU-D-DIN TUGHAN KHAN.
Since the juggling sky at that time had thrown the reins of

Viceroyalty of Bengal (Lakhnanti), when Alanddin Jani, the Bengal Viceroy,
was recalled. He captured several elephants in Vilayet-i-Bang (Hast
Bengal), sent them as presents to the Delhi Emperor (Shamsuddin Altamsh)
and received the tatle of Ighantat

Nasiri, the neaiest contemporary account (Pers. text, p. 242),—-Malik Tughan
Khin Turki was comely m appearance, and noble in heart, He hailed
from Khata. He was hberal and generous, endowed with noble qualities ;
in hberahty and generesity, and 1n conciliating and winumg over people,
he had no match in the army. When the Salfin (Emperor Altamsh)
purchased him, he firat hecame the Royal cup-bearer, next he was appointed
Secretary and Keeper of the Imperial Seal (Dawat Dar). He lost the
Imperial jewelled ink-pot, and was degraded to the office of Chashmgir
(a taster to a prince), and after a long time, was appointed Superintendent
of the Imperial stables (Amir-i-Akhur); and after some time, was appointed
fendatory of Badaon, and next appoimted Governor of Behar, when Lakhnauti
(Bengal) was conferred on Ighantat Sarfuddm Aibak, At length when Saif-
uddin died, Tughan Khan was appointed to the vacant Bengal (Lakhnanta)
Viceroyaity. After the death of Sultan Nagraddin Mahmid (son of Emperor
Altamgh, and Viceroy of Bengal), between Tughan Khin and the feudatory of
Lakhnauti named Lakor Aibak, who enjoyed the title of Aur Khén, 1!l-feehng

both wings of Lakhnanti, one beimg in Radh on the side of Lakor (probably
Nagor) an@ the other being 1 Barand, on the side of Deokot At this

him back), and 11 Onudh met Minhaju-s-Siraj, (author ef Tabagat-i-Nasiz1),

Tughan Khin and Tamar Khin ill-feeling ensued, and they fought against

of Minhaju-s-Sira; (author of Tabaqat-1-Nasir1) peace was brought about
between the two, on condition that Lakhnaut: would be left to Tamar
Khin, and Tugh.n Khin with his treasures and elephants and effects
would retue to Delhi, Tughan did so (in his company bemg Minhaju-
s-Siraj); the Emperor loaded him with presents, bestowed on him
the Governorship of Ondh, whilst Tnmar Khin held the Bengal
Vioeroyalty. On the same night, both died, Tamar Khin at Lakbnanti,
and Taghan in Oudh!”

It would appear from the above that the invasion of Bengal by Mughals
under Changiz Khiin referred to in the text, 1s 9 myth and « mistake for the
invasion of Lahhnanti by the Hindus of Jiaynagar (Orissa). The mistake
is repeated in nany histories, but Tabagat’s account is the most-retiable,
as its author was an eye-witness of the affair.

L The daughter of Emperor Altamsh named Raziah, ascended the throne
of Delhiin accordance with her father’s wishes in 634 A.H. (1236 A.C )
The sight of an unveiled Moslem Empress seated on the Imperial
throne of Delhi, struck all Indo-Moslem eyes in those days as 4 curious
phenomenon, end hence our author’s expression, “Juggling sky.” She
reigned for thiee years from 1286 A.C. to 1289 AO. According to
Badaoni, the Empress was endowed with oxeellent qualities, ata was
brave, generous and intelligent. She followed the path of equity and the
principles of Justiee, aud set in order the affairs which had remamed in con-
fusion during the bnef reign of her step-brother Sultin Ruknuddin Firnz

devoted himself to the administration of the country, and for a
period was successful. When in the year 639 A.H. Sultan
Alan-d-din Masud ascended the throne of Delhi, Tughan Khan sent
many presents and valuables to the Emperor of Dehliin charge
of Sharfu-l-Molk Sanqgati, and the Emperor sent to Izzu-d-din
Tughan Khan in charge of Qazi Jalalu-d-din, Governor of Oudh,
a ruby-laid umbrella and a special robe of honour. And in the
year 642 A.H., thirty thousand Mughal soldiers of Changiz Khar,
making an incursion into the kingdom of Lakhnauti through
the passes of the northern mountains, created much confusion.
Malik Izzu-d-din sent an account of this to Sultan Aldu-d-din
On hearing of this, the Emperor despatched to Lakhnauti a
large force under Mahk Qurabég T. mar Khan, who was one of
the servants of Khwajah Tash, for assisting Tughin Khan, At
the time of engagement, the Mughal forces not being able to give

RULE OF ARSALAN KHAN’

When Arsalan Khan became Viceroy of Lakhnanti, he devot-

and much jewellery and rave stuffs to Sultan Nagirn-d-din, and
shortly after died at Lakhnauti.

Oudh. Whilst at Oadh, he invaded all the eastern tracts meludmg Tirhat,
and carried off immense booty. He was thence sent to Lakbnauti to help
Tughan Khinin repelling the Oomya invasion, and after that settled down
in Bengal as its Viceroy.

India from the commencement of Musalman Rule down to 658 A HI.
(1260 A.C ) Sulfim Nasiru-d-din succeeded Sulfin Alan-d-din to the throne
of Dethiin 1246 A.0. His Vizier was Ghiasu-d-din Balban (afterwards Em-
peror Balban). Of the six years which intervened between 658 A.H. and
664 A.H. (the date of assumption of sovereignty by Emperor Balban) there
is no known historical work. The Tarikh Firaz Shahi of Zian-d-din Barni
only began from Ghiasu-d-din Balban’s reign. Emperor Balban reigned from
1265 to 1287 A.C.

year he was attacked by Taju-d-din Arsalan Khiin Sanjar-1-Khwarizmi, who
was subsequently captured or killed at Lokhnauti by Izzn-d-din. Hence

RULE OF MUHAMMAD TATAR KHAN.

After the death of Arsalan Khan, his son, Md. Tatar Khau, who
was illustrious for his bravery, liberality, heroism and honesty,
becoming independent im lis rale of Lakhnauti, did not much
bend his head in submission to Emperor Nagirn-d-din. And after
a while, he had the Khutbah ip the kingdom of Lakhnanti recited
in Ins own name, and for some time he passed in this wise. And
when in the year 664 A.H. the thione of Dehli received eclat
from the accession of Sultan Ghidsu-d-din Balban, and the fame
of Ingh aspiration and steadiness and high ambition of that
limperor spread to all sides, Md. Tatar Khan, using fcresight,
sent sixty-three head of elephants, together with other presenta,
to Dehli. As this was the first year of his accession, Sultan
Ghiagu-d-din Balban considering this an auspicious augury, illu-
minated the City with lamps, and the nobles, feudatories and the
principal officers presenting nazar became recipients of gifts.
And the envoys of Muhammad Tatar Khan, after being loaded
with presenta, got permission to retuin Tatar Khan pleased with
the Impeual gifts,submitted and enrolled himself in the 1anks of
the Emperov’s Omara. Sultan Ghiagu-d-din Balban appointed a
Turkish slave named Tughral to the Viceroyalty of Lakhnauti.?

1 Muhammad Arsalan Tiatir Khan, son of A:salan Khan Sanjar, had
been for some time Governor of Bengal, when the Emperor Balban
ascended the throne (664 A.H.) (See Tankh Fuuz Shahi, by Ziau-d-din
Barn, Pers. text, pp. 53 and 66.) He was generous, liberaland brave After a
few years he wag succeeded by Tughral, who proclaimed himself king, under
the title of Sultan Mughisu-d-din,

% This account differs slightly from Piofessoy Blochmann’s conclusions
derived from inscriptions and the evidence of coins, as set forth in his Contn-
butions to the History and Geogiaphy of Bengal Professor Blochmann holds
that on the death of Muhammed Tatir Khin, whith took place shortly after
Balban’s accession, Sher Khan was appointed Impermal Governor of
Lakhnanti; that Sher Khan was succeeded m the office by Amin Khan,
whose Deputy or Naib was Tughal. ‘loghral heard of Balban’s :1lnesss
attacked and defeated Amm Khan, and proclaimed himself king of
Bengal under the title of Sulfin Muaghisu-d-din (A.C. 1279). Balban
recovered from his illness shortly afte., invaded Bengal in person, defeated
Tughral, at some place near Sunargaon, where Danu) Rai was the zemindar
(Tarikh-i-Firng Shahi, p 87), and in 681 H. (A.0. 1282) before leaving Bengal
conferred the throne of Bengal on his (the Empe:or Balban’s) son, Bughra
Khan, who assnmed the title of Sulfan Nasiru-d-din. Nigiru-d-din appears to
have died in 691 H. (1292 A.O.), that is about five years after the death of his

RULE OF TUGHRAL, STYLED SULTAN MUGHISU-D-
DIN.

Tughral became Viceroy of Lakhnauti. In that, in liberality
and bravery, courage and sagacity he was unequalled, in a short
time he brought the kingdom of Lakhnanti to subjection and
order, and subjugated Kamrup (Western Assam). In the year
678 AH. he marched with his forces fiom Lakhnanti to Jajnagar,
and vanquishing the Rajah of that place, obtained many elephants
and much riches and chattels and stuffs. In that Sultan Qhiagu-
d-din Balban had become old, and both of his sons were at Multan
with large forces engaged in fighting the Mughals, the kingdom
of Lakhnanti was lost sight of In consequence of this circum-
stance, Tughral failed to despatch elephants and booty to the
Emperor. And also as at the time the Emperor was sick at Delhi,
and had not come out of the palace for one month, and rumours
of his death had spread in the Empire, Tughral finding the field
completely open, sallied out, and collecting a laige force proclaimed
himself Sultan Mughisu-d-din, and unfurling on his head the red
Royal umbrella, had the Khutbah in that country recited after his
own name. Simultaneously with this event, the Emperor recovered
health, and royal edicts aunouncing the recovery were received.
Tughral, not becoming ashamed of what he had done, struck the
hand of disloyalty on the hem of hostility. When Sultan
Ghiagu-d-din Balban became aware of this, he despatched Malik
Abtakin who had long haira, and who had the title of Amin
Khan and was Governor of Oudb, appointing him generalissimo

illustrioas father Emperor Balban. For a fall account of Tughral styled Sul-
tin Mughisu-d-din, see Tabagat-i-Nasiri (Pers. text, p. 261), and also Tarikh-i-
Firnz Shahi (Pers text, pp 81 to 94), by Zian-d-din Barni Before becoming
Governor of Bengal, he held the following offices: Chashnigir (Taster toa
prince) under Shamsn-d-din Altamsh ; Amir-ul Majhs or Lord Chamberlain
under Emperor Ruknu-d-din, Superintendent of Elephants, next Superintend-
ent of Stables under Empress Raziah, feudatory of Tabarhind under Sultin
Alau-d-din, next feudatory of Kananj and Governor of Oudh, and next Vice.
roy of Bengal. He invaded Jajnagar (Orissa), Qudh and Kamrap (Weatern
Agsam) successfully, and then proclaimed his independence. Tughral was
active and energetic, bold and courageous, hberal and generous tis worthy
of note that in this connection, the author of Tarnkh-1-Firaz Shahi (p. 93),
for the jirst time uses expressions like these, “ Iqlim-i-Lakhnauti,” “ Iqlim-i-
Sunargaon,” “ Arsah-i-Bangalah,”—indicating that Tughral had considerably
extended his Bengal Satrapy,

of the expedition, ind also Viceroy of Lakhnauti, together with
other nobles, such as Tamar Khan Shamsi, Malik Taju-d-din, son
of ‘Ali Khan,' and Jamalu-d-din Qandahiri, for destroying
Tnghral. And when Malik Abtakin with a large force crossed
the river Sro, and marched towards Lakhnanti, Tughral, too, with
alarge foree came to encounter him. In that, ia bravery and
generosity, he was matchless, some nobles and soldiers desetting
Amin Khin joined Tughral, so that on -the day of engage-
ment the force of Amin Khan was ionted. And when Amin
Khan being vanquished retreated to Ondh, the Emperor hearing
of this became anxious and perplexed, ordered that Amin Khan
should be hanged at the gate of Oudh, and afterwards appointed
Malik Tarmini with a large force for destioying Tughral. And
Tughral making a bold attack vanquished this force also, and
obtained much booty.

Owing to strength of fortune,
that rampant lion,
Twice routed the army of the enemy.

Sultin Ghiagu-d-din, on hearing this bad news, became
dejected and anxious, and made kingly efforts, and boldly resolved
to march out himself, and ordered that numerous boats should be
kept ready in the rivers Jon and Ganges, and he himself on the
pretext of a hunting excursion went towards Sanam and Saminah,
Appointing Malik Siinaj to be governor of Samanah, he took his
young son, Bughraé Khan, with a select force in his own company,
and passed fiom Samfnah to Doab. Leaving Maliku-]-Umara-
Fakhru-d-din Kotwal to rule as Viceroy at Debli in his absence,
he crossed the Ganges, and not heeding that it was the rainy
season, by forced marches, proceeded towards Lakhnanti.
Tnghral who in this interval had collected his efficient troops,
marched 1n state towards Jajnagar with his treasures and a large
army, and planned to take it and to encamp there, and subse-
quently to return to Lakhnauti, when the Emperor would return
to Dehli But when the Emperor reached Lakhnanti, after stay-
ing there a few days, he despatched General Hassimu-d-din
Vakil-dar Baibag (Secretary of State), who was the grandfather
of the author of the Tarith-i-Firuz Shah?, to subjugate the

kingdom of Lakhnauti, and the Emperor himself marched towards
Jujnagar,! to chastise Tughral. At the time, when the Emperor
reached the confines of Sunargaon, Bhij Rai.2 who was the Zamin-
dar of that place, enrolled himself in the ranks of the Imperial
adherents, and promised that in case T'ughral attempted to escape
across the river,? he would prevent his doing so. But when the
Emperor swiftly passing from that place marched several stages,
the trace of Tughral was lost, and no one could give a clue to his
whereabouts. The Emperor ordered Malik Barbak Baras* that
he should march ahead ten or twelx a Karoh with seven thousand
chosen cavalry. Although these tried every means of pursuit and
search, they could obtain no trace of Tu ghral. One day, Malik
Muhammad Tirandaz,® the ruler o. Koel,° and his brother, Malik
Mnuqaddar, separating themselves from the vanguard force, with
thirty or forty troopers marched ahead. Suddenly, ona field they
came across some grocers. Arresting these, they made enquiries,
and in order to frighten them, they commenced slaughter by
breaking the neck of one; then the others cried ont —" If your object
is to obtain goods and provisions, whatever we have, you may take;
bat spare our lives.” Malik Muhammad Tirand&z said: “ We
have no concern with your goods and stores: our object is to
ascertain the whereabouts of Tughral, If you show the way, your
lives aud things would be spared; otherwise whatever will befal
you, will be the consequence of your misconduct.” The grocers
said: “ We carried food-grains to the camp of Tughral,’ and now

opportunity, he rushed with his cavalry towards the camp of
Tughral. No one opposed their progress, fancying that they
were officers attached to the army of Tughral. When they
arrived in front of Tughral’s tent, all of a sudden drawing thew
swords, they killed every one they found in the Andience-Hall,
and shouted ont that the kingdomwn of Bengal pertained to the
Empire of Balban. Tughral fancied that the Emperor had him-
self arrived. Becomimg totally confounded, he slipped ont in
great perplexity by the bath-room deor, and mounting an un-
saddled hoise, and not mustering his own adherents, owing to
great confusion of mind, he intended to plunge into the river near
the soldiers’ quarters, and then to swim across to Jajnagar. As
misfortune would have it, owing to the disappearance of Tughral,
all his officers, soldiers and followers tarned towards different
directions. And Malik Muqaddar, at whose hands the slaughter
of Tughral had been destined, marched in pursuit of Tughral,
and encountered him on the river-bank. Then Malik Mugaddar
shot 9 shooting arrow at Tughral’s shoulder, dismounted the latter
from. his horse, and himself dismounting from his own horse, sever-
ed Tughral’s head from the body. Seeing that the followers of
Tughbral were searching for their master, Malik Mugaddar hid
Tughral’s head in the mud by the river-side, and flang his body
into the river, and pulling off his own garments, he set himself to
washing them. At this moment, Tughral’s soldiers arrived,

across the river, or somewhere clase to the modern Bhoyrab Bazar ferry,
seriously planning to cross ever on boats from the Ducea side to the Tipperah
tract (which has been identifed here with Jajnagar), with theold and

shouting out “Lord of the world! Lord of the world!” and
searched for Tughral Not finding him, they took to their heels.

They shot an arrow at his heart,!

Dismounted him from his horse, and cut off his head:

When Tughral at that place was killed owing to his in-
alertness,

One shout arose from every side
The adherents of Tughral were completely routed,
From the absence of their leader, tuey wore all cowed down.

At this time Malik Babak Baras? arrived, and Mugaddar run-
ning forward announced the joyful tidings of the victory. Malhk
Barbak applauding him sent a despatch to the Emperor, ¢ anouncing
the victory, together with the head of Tughral. On the following
day, together with the booty and prisoners of Tughral’s army, he
proceeded himself to the Emperor, and narrated the story of the
victory. And Malik Muhammad Tirandaz’ was promoted to the
first rank, and his brother Mahk Muqaddar* received the title of
Tughral-kush (“‘ Tughral-slayer’’), and was raised to the peerage,
Sultan Ghiisu-d-dia Balban after this marched back to Lakhnauti,
and set himself to the work of chastisement. Along both sides of
the road passing through the market-place of the City, putting up
scaffolds, the Emperor hanged such adherents of Tughral as had
been taken prisoners, and capturing their women and children,
wherever found, he had them slaughtered at Lakhnauti, after
putting them to indescribable tertures. Till that time, none of
the Emperors of Dehli had slaughtered the children and women
ef miscreants.’ After this, the Emperor bestowed the kingdom of

1 Bughra Khin, younger son of Emperor Balban, assumed the royal
title of Sultin Nisiru-d-din at his clevation to the throne of Bengal, He
was the first of a snecession of Balhani Kings who ruled over Bengal,
from 1282 A.C to 1331 A.C (or 681 AH to 731 A.H ) and had mostly
their court at Sunargaon near Dacca. Niasiru-d-din Bughra Khan, son of
Emperor Balban, reigned over Bengal frown 681 H. to 691 (1282 AC. to
1292 A.C) and was succeeded by iis son Ruknu-d-din who assumed the
title of Sultin Kai-Kans From msc..ptions found at Gangarampur and

691, 693, 694, 695 4.H Te appears to have been succeeded by his brother
who reigned under the name of Shamsu-d-diu Firuzg Shah. Firuz Shah had
several sons, namely, Bughra Khiin, Nasiru-d-din, Ghiasu-d-din or Bahadur
Khan, Qutin Khan, and Hatrm Khan. Tho third kon, Ghiasu-d-din, made
“ conquests 1. Hastern Bengal, established himself at Sunaigaon near Dacca,
and struck coms from 1311 AOC. under the name of Bahadur Shah. The
fifth son Watim Khan was m 1309 and 1315 A.C. Governor of Oudh. Firnz
Shih sued in 718 H. (1818 A.C.) Quarrels thun broke out between the
several sons of Firnz Shah, who was succeeded by his eldest son who took
the title of Shahabu-d-din Bughra Shah who ruled at Lakhnantiin 1818-19,
Svon after his accession, Bughra Shah was defeated by his brother Bahadur
Shah who reigned at Sunargaon, Bughia Shih and his brother Nésiru-d-din
took refuge with Emperor Tughluk Shah who in 1820 bad mounted the throno
of Delhi. Qutlu Khin, another brother, was killed by Bahadar Shih who
was now supreme King over Bengal and Behar, and held a magmificent
Court at Sunargaon

At the instigation of Bughra Shih and Nasiru-d-din, the fugitives (says
Ibn Batutah), Emperor Tughlak Shih invaded Bengal. When the Imperia!
army left Delhi, Bahadur Shih retired to Sunargaop, whilst Nasirn-d-din
joining the Emperor at Tirhut came with the letter to Lakhnauti, when the
Emperor confirms Nisiru-d-din as Governor of Lakhuauti, The Emperor
sont his adopted son Tatar Khin, Governor of Zafarabad (near Jaunpur) with
an army to operateagainst Sultan Bahadur Shih, who was captured and sent
to Delhi with a chain round his neck. At this time, also, two additional
distinct Provinces in Bengal were constituted, viz, Sunargaon and Satgaon,
cach being placed under a Military Governor; whilst Behar was separated
from Bengal, Sunargaon was placed under Tatar Khin.

With the accidental death of Emperor Tnghlak Shah and the acces-
gion of his successor Emperor Muhammad §hah Tughlak, other changes
took place in the administration of Bengal. The new Emperor released
Bahadur Shah, allowed him to return to Sunargaon, on condition that the
Bengal comage was to bear the joint names of Bahadur Shih and the Emperor
Muhammad Toghlak, and algo that ia the Khutbah the names of both wera to

the title of Sultan Ndasirn-d-din, he placed on the son’s head the
royal umbrella, and allowed also the Khuthah to be recited and the
coin to be minted in lus name, And at the time of departure, the
Emperor giving lis son some parting advice! said ‘It 1s not
discreet for the king of Lakhnauti, be hea relation or a stranger,
to quarrel with or rebel agamst the Empeior of Delhi And if
the Emperor of Delhi marches to Lakhnauti, the ruler of Lakhnauti
should retreating tuke refuge in some distant corner, and when
the Emperor of Delhi withdraws, he should retuin to Lakhnauti,
and resume his wok And in the levy of revenue from sub-
jects, he should observe the middle course, that is, he should
not levy such a low amount, that they should become refractory
and disloyal, nor such an excessive amount, that they should be
ground down and oppressed And he should pay such an amonnt
of salary to his officers, that it may suffice for them from ycar
to year, and that they may not be pmched in regard to their
necossary expenses In matters of administration he should take
counsel] with wise people who are sincere and loyal, and in the
enforcement of orders, he should abstain from self-indulgence, and

be recited, .atar Khin who was Intherto Military Governor of Sunargaon,
received the title of Bahram Khin, and was stationed at Sunargaon at the
Court of Bahadur Shah, as a sort of Imperial Resident. Niasiru-d-din was
continued as Subordinate Governor of Lakhnauti,

In 726 AH (1826 A.O), Nasiru-d-din died, and Muhammad Shih
appointed Malik Bidar Khilji as Governor of Lakhnauti with the title of
Qadr Khin. Bahadur Shah, the king, at Sunargaon, atiempted soon after

army to Bahram’s assistance Bahadur Shah, the last Bengal Balbanj
sovereign, and the last royal representative of the honse of Emperor Ghiasu-

should not act unjustly from selfishness. In the care for the condi.
tion of the army, he should not be negligent, and he should consider
it incumbent upon himself to show them considerateness and to win
their hearts, and he should not allow neghgence and indolence to
intervene. And whoever tempts you away from this course, you
should look upon him as your enemy, and you should not listen to
his talk. You should seek protection with persons who relinquish-
ing this world, have dedicated themselves to God’s service.

Help from the old hems of saints,
Is stronger than the strength of a hundred walls of

After this, bidding adicn to his son, the Emperor returned to
Delhi, by forced marches, after three months ! The period of the
vule of Tughral m Bengal was twenty-five years and some months.

RULE OF BUGHRA KHAN, STYLED SULTAN NASIRU-
D-DIN, SON OF EMPEROR GHIASU-D-DIN BALBAN.

When Sultan Nasiru-d-din became ruler of the kingdom of
Lakhnanti, after some time, his elder brother who was named
Sultan Muhammad and was known as Khan-i-Shahid? was killed
at Multan, fighting against the Mughals And Sultin Ghidsu-d-
din Balban who was much attached to him, became dejected by
his death, and summoned Sultan Nasiru-d-din from Lakhnanti,
When the latter reached Delhi, after observing the necessary
mourning ceremonies for his elder brother, he attempted to
console the heart of his father. The Emperor said: “The death
of your brother has made me sick and feeble, and soon the time of

1 In Tarikh Firuz Shahi (p. 107), “‘ after three years.”

2 Snitin Muhammad, eldest son of Emperor Ghiasu-d-din Balban, was
Imperial Viceroy of Multan Province or Viliyet at this time. This Prince
was brave, gallant and accomplished, and he fell gallantly fighting between
Lahore and Dibalpur ageinst the Mughul hordes ander Tamar from Central
Asia who were herrying: at this time the North-Western frontier of India
Hence the Prince is styled “ Khan-i-Ghahid’? or “ Martyred Prince or
Chief" His death was a groat shock to the aged Emperor, (See Tarikh-i-
Wiuz Shahi, pp. 109-10). ‘he Prince was % patron of learning, and to his
court ab Multin were attached the celebrated posts, Amir Khusran and Amir
Hasan, for whose biographicat sketch, see Badaoni, Vol. 1, pp, 200-201

my departure from the world shall approach. At this time, your
separation from me is not proper, because besides yourself, I have
no other heir. Your son, Kaiqubad, and your nephew, Kai Khusran,
are young, and have no experience of life. Should the Empire
fall mto their hands, they would be incapable of defending it, and
you would have to pay homage to either who might ascend the
throne of Delhi. Therefore, it is meet that you should remain
with me” Nasru-d-din, according to his father’s request, re-
mained with his father. But on seeing his father regain some
health, he quickly under pretext of hunting went ont of the city,
and without taking leave of the Emperor returned to Lakhnauti,
The Emperor, being affected at this, again fell ill, and in the year
685 A H., passed from this transitory world. And when Sultan
Muizu-d-din Kaiqubad, after the death of his grand-father, at the
age of eighteen years, mounted the throne of Delhi, in consequence
of youth, indulging in frivolities and dissipations, he became un-
mindful of the affairs of the Empire, excepting women and wine!
And Malik Nizimu-d-din setting himself to the destruction of the
Balbani family, induced Muizu-d-din to call his cousin Kaikhusrai
from Multan; and to kill him on the way, and to dismiss many of
the loyal Umara. Sultan Nagiru-d-din Bughré Khan at Lakhnauti,
on receiving news of the negligence of his son, and of the over-
bearing influence of Malik Nizaimu-d-din, wrote to his son letters
containing instructions, and by insinuations and hints, advised

1 Zianddin Barni, author of Tarikh-i-Furuz Shahi (p 121) states that
shortly before his death in 686 A.H (1287 A C.), the aged and venerable Em-
peror Ghiasu-d-din Balban summoned to his presence in his palace in Delhi,
Mahk-ul-Umara Fakhro-d-din Kotwal (or police commissioner) of Delhi,
Khwajah Hussain Basri, the Vizier or Prime Mmuister, and some others, and
mstracted them to place Ka: Khusrau, son of Sultin Muhammad, on the
throne. After the Emperor’s death, however, the Kotwal and his party placed
Kaiqubad, son of Sultin Nasiru-d-din Bughra Khan (King of Bengal, and
second son of the Emperor) on the throne, The personnel of Sultan
Muizn-d-din Kaiqubid’s administration consisted of (1) Malik-ul-Umara
Kotwal of Delhi, (2) Nizamn-d-din, nephew of Mahk-ul-Umara, who
became Dadbig or Chief Justice, and subsequently Wazir or Prime Minister,
(8) Malik Quamu-d-din who became Wakilder or Admmistrator-General.
Emperor Kaiqubad, who was a boy of seventeen years, was addicted to
pleasures, and spent most of his time in the charming pleasure-villa of
Kilukhan, in the suburbs of Delhi Nizamu-d-din the Wazir who now
assumed the title of Nizamu-l-Mulk, set abont devising means to destroy
the hoyse of Balban (see Tankh-i-Firaz Shahi, p. 182)

him to beware of the wily enemy in the person of Nizamu-d-din
It was of no use In despair, two years after the death of Emperor
Balban, in the year 687 AH with the object of conquenug the
province of Delhi, and chastising his son, Nasiru-d-din Bughra
Khan marched with his army. On reaching Behar, Sultan
Nagitu-d-din passing from Behar to the banks of the river Sava,
encamped.!

The standards of the Emperor of the world were pitched
On the banks of the Ghagar, in the environs of the town.
The Ghagar was on one side, and the Sari on the other,
From excessive heat, the soldiers foamed from their mouths
The swoid-casting Bast from yonder side of the river
Became bright as 1f the sun had risen ;

On the banks of the river, the marshalling of the forces
Flashed like two Suns from two sides.

At length, after nearing each other, Sultan Nagi: u-d-din, aban-
doning the idea of the conquest of Delhi, made overtures for peace.
And Sultin Muizu-d-din, owing to the instigation of Malhk
Niz&imo-d-din, refused to make pence, and prepared to fight.
After negotiations had proceeded for three days between the con-
tending parties, on the fourth day, Sultan Nagru-d-din wath his
own hand wrote :—

“Son! I have a great longing to meet you. I have no further
strength of self-restraint 1m your separation. Lf you show a way
by which I who am consamed by the fire of misfortune, may behold

L The text here is rather confused. In Foriahta, the rendering 13 as fol-
lows: “When Sulfin Mujzu-d-din Kaiqubad heard of the intention of his
futhor (Sulfin Nagira-d-din Baghra Khiin, King of Bengal) and of the Intter’s
arrival in Behar, he {Emperor Kaiqubid), too, ar:uyed his forces, and in the
hottest part of the year reached th. banka of the Ghagar river, and halted,
And Saljin Nagirn-d-din, on hearing of the news, advanced from Behur,
reached the banka of the river Sro, and halted.” The meeting between
Salina Napru-d-din Baghra Khin and his son the: Emperor Kaiyubad is
immortalized mm the pages of “Qiranu-sSadain * by Amir Khusran, the
celebrated poet of Delhi. The camp of the futher was on the bank of the
river Sro or Sari or Sarju, the old mver boundary-line between the Musalman
Kingdom of Bengal (whioh included Behar in those days) and the Empire
of Delhi, and the camp of the son was on the opposite banka of the Sro.

yon, and, Jacob-like, if once more my eye which has become
blind, becomes bright by the sight of Joseph, no harm shall betide
to your sovereignty and enjoyment.” The Sultan wound up this
message with the following verse :—

“ Although paradise is a happy region,
Nothing is better than the joy of union.”

Sultén Mauizu-d-din being touched by the perusal of his father’s
letter desired to proceed unattended, to mect his father Niz&imu-
d-din used dissuasion, and arranged that the Emperor, with all
Imperial pomp and paraphernalia, should for the purpose of
meeting his father march from the bank of the river Ghagar to-
wards a plain, and then encamp on the bank of the Sari. And it
was also arranged that out of regard for the rank of the Emperor
of Delhi, Nagirn-d-din crossing the Sari should come to visit
Kaiqubad, who should remain seated on the throne. Then Bughra
Khan embarking on a boat crossed the river, and proceeded to the
tent of Muizu-d-din Kaiqubad, Kaiqubad being overpowered by
feelings dismounted from the throne, prostrated himself on his
father’s feet, and both the father and the son embracing each
other, and giving each other kisses on the head and the face shed
tears. After this, the father catching the hand of the son, placed
the latter on the throne, and desired to stand in front of it. The
son descending from the throne placed the father on it, and him-
self respectfully sat before him ; and ceremonies of rejoicings were
performed. After a while, Sultan Nagiru-d-din left, and crossing
the river returned to his tent,. From both sides gifts were ex-
changed. Several days successively, Sultan Nagiru-d-din went to
meet his son, and both were in each other’s company. And on
the day of departure, after speaking some words of advice, ! and
taking his son in the lap, he departed, and weeping and crying
returned to his own camp, That day he ate no food, and told his
confidants: “To-day Ihave bid the last farewell to my son.”

LIt is stated that on the day of departure, Sultin Nagiru-d-din
Bughra Kpan exhorted his son, Mmperor Kaiqnbad, to attend to prayer and to
observe the fast of Ramzan, taught him certain regulations and fixed rules
of sovereignty, warned lim against excesses im wine and neglect of State
matters, rebuked him for killing Kai Khusrau and other noted Annra and
Maluks of Ghiagn-d-din Balbau, and advised him to dismiss Nizamo-d-din alias
Nivamul Mulk, the Wazr. (See Parzkh-i- Firuz-Qhahi, pp. 144 to 156),

reign, however, of Sultan Qutbu-d-din Khuilji, he usurped the
savereignty of Bengal, and proclaiming Inmself Bahadur Shah,
introduced the Khutbah and the com in the kingdom of Bengal
after his own name, and commenced oppressions. For some time,
he passed in this wise. But when the Empire of Delhi passed to
Ghiisu-d-din Tughlak Shah,! in the year 724 A H. petations from
Lakhuauti describing the oppressions of the rulers of that country
were received. Sultdu Tughlak Shih with an efficient army
marched towards Bengal. When he reached ‘irhut, Sultan
Nagru-d-din® whose fief had not been confiscated during Alau-d-
din’s reigu owing to his good conduct and who resided in a corner of
Lakhnauti, not finding strength in himself to contend against
Tughlak Shab, submitted to Ins fate, marched from Lakhnauti
to Tirhit, and presenting himself before the Emperor offered

Malk then assumed the title of Ghiasu-d-din Tughlak Shih. Huis father
was a Pukish slave, named Mahk, of Sultin Ghiasu-d-din Balban, and
his mother was of a Punjab fannly. Brave, noble, and magnanimous,
he was the founder of the Tughlak dynasty wich reigned for nmety-
four years at Delhi (13.0-1414 AC) He founded the city of Tughla-
kabad, about 4 miles east of Delhi He reigned from 1820 to 1824 AC. In
order to put down the assumption of entire independence by Bahadur Shah
at Sunargaon in Bengal, Ghiasu-d-din Tughlak marched to Snnargaon, fought
a decisive engagement, took Bahadur Shih a prusoner, and marched back with
the latter towards Delhi, stormmg the fort of Tirhnt, and leaving Nasirn-
d-din as Governor of Vilayet-1-Lakhnauti. Chiasn-d-din divided Bengal into
three provinces, namely (1) Vilayet-1-Lakhnanti, (2) Vilayet-i-Satgiion.
(3) Vilayet-1-Sanaigiion, placing each under a distinct Governor, and placing a
Viceroy (stationed at Sunargion) over all the Governors. Tamkh-i-Firuz-Shibi

3 This Nisiru-d-din was a grandson of Sultin Nisira-d-din Bughra Shah,
son of Emperor Balban. He was Governor of Lakhnauti, but had heen
ousted by his brother Bahadur Shih, king of Bengal, who held his court at
Sunargaon. This Nasiru-d-din and another brother Bughra Khan had taken
refuge at the time with the Emperor of Delhi (Tughlak Shah) who at their
instigation invaded Bengal to chastise their brother, Bahadar Shah (king
of Bengal). The text, however, is misleading, and would incorrectly
indicate that the Nastru-d-din here 1eferred toi Sultin N&aura-d-din Bughra
Shah, king of Bengal (son of Emperor Balban). See, however, Blochmann’s

him honourably, bestowed on him the Royal Umbrella and the
Royal Staff, and ratified according to the old custom the continu-
ance of Sultan Nasiru-d-din’s fief. And biinging to his presence
Bahadur Shah who had proved hostile, the Emperor enrolled
him in the ranks of nobles. He, too, submitting to the Emperor,
behaved like one of the nobles. Emperor Ghiadsu-d-din, appoint-
ing his adopted son, Tatar Khan, Governor of Sunargaon,
and entrusting to Nasiru-d-din the over-loidship of Sunargaon,
Gaur and Bengal, returned to Delhi! But soon after, Sultan
Nasiru-d-din died. The period of the rule of Bahadur Shah in

throne of Delhi under the title of Sultan Muhammad Shah Taghlak in 725 AIL.
An accomplished scholar, a general of the first order, a man of consummate
ability, his eccentricify and visionary schemes marred his success as a
sovereign. His great ambition was to extend his empire over the world,
and to beo second Alexander. He fruitlessly threw away the pick of his
splendid army for the invasion of Persia and the conquest of China.
Though the fertility of his genius evolved and organised a revenue system,
his financial eccentricity’ in establishing a fixed currency of copper
coins completely disorganised it. He recerved an embassy from the
Khalifa of Egypt, who sent out to him the investiture of Royalty.
In lus reign a severe famine broke out in Delhi, and in consequence
there was a general exodus of its population to Bengal. He restored Baha-
dur Shah to the kingdom ofSanargaon on certain conditions, but subsequent.
ly dethroned him. Iu his reign, Bengal became independent under Fakhru-
d-din. (See Tarikh-i-eFiruz §hihi, pp. 428, 452, 457 to 461, 478, 475, 478,

administration of that country, Qadrv Khan was killed at the
hands of his servant, Fakhru-d-din, as will be related hereafter.

hundred and fifty years, and that in the kingdom of Bengal its
rulers exercised authority as Viecroys of the Emperors of Delhi,
and that the KAutbak and the culms of the Emperors of Delhi

who was Qadr Khian’s Armour-Superintendent, meddling in
administrative matters, obtained much influence, and, resolving in
mind to usurp the Viceroyalty, watched for an opportunity.
Finding Qady Khan off his guaid, Fakhru-d-din revolted, killed
his owu master, and became Viceroy of the kingdom of Bengal:
When the Empire of Muhammad Shah, the Emperor of Delhi,

AN ACCOUNT OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF SULTAN
FAKHRU-D-DIN

When Sult&n Pakhru-d-din ascended the throne of the
kingdom of Lakhnanti, he sent ont his officer Mukhalis Kban
with an efficient army for the subjugation of the outlying pro-
vinees of Bengal. Malik ‘Ali Mubaiik, the generalissimo of
Qadr Khan, encountered him with a large army, and after much
fighting killed Mukhalis Khan, and routed the latter’s entire force.
Sultan Fakhru-d-din who had just become king, and was not
confident of the loyalty of his officers, did not venture to attack

“ Initial Coinage’, would mdicate that he reigned for ten years and some
months. Ibn-1-Batutah mentions that he was an eminent man, and ve

(Tarkh-i-Piraz Shahi by Shams-i-Siraj, pp 105-114) invaded Bengal a second
time during Sekandar Shih’s reign. Bengal attsined great prospenty during
the rnle of these Independent Musalman Kings, Fonts and' public buildings
were erected, Mosques, Colleges, Stndents’ Hostels nnd Travellers’ Guest-housea
and Khangnhs were established in all parts of the Kingdom, tanks excavated,
and roads laid down. ‘wo great Royal Honses—one of Hay: Ilyas and another
of Alan-d-din Husain Shih (with a brief break of about forty years, during
which Rajah Kang and his successors usurped the Bengal Kingdom)

expansion during this period. Western Assam (or Kamritp), portions of Koch-
Behar, and portions of Jajuagar (or Orissa', the whole of North Behar,
(Tarikh-i-Firaz Shahi. p 586) and eastern portions of Sonth Behar up to
generally the town of Behar, were subject to the Bengal Kingdom,
Musalman arms were carried far to the east across the Megna, which had
hitherto proved a great barrier to Musnlinnn extension, right up to
Sithat and the westera pottions of Tiperah and Noakhali districts, mofuding
Chittagong. Great theistic movements having for their objectthe con-
ciliation of the two races, sprang up. Kabir and Chaitanyn, the great spiritual
leaders who preached catholic doctrines, flourished in this period,

THE ACCESSION TO THE THRONE OF ‘ALI MUBARIK

It is said that in the beginning Malik ‘Ali Mubarik was one of
the trusty servants of Malik Firuz Rajab Aud Mahk¥Firuz was

L The account in Badeoni (vol. I, p. 280 Pers. (text) gives a different ver-
sion, Badaoni states as follows -—On the death of Bahram Khin, Governor of
Sanargaon, im 730 A. H, Malik Fakhruddm who was bis Silahdar or Quarter-
master General, revolicd, assumed the title of Fakhraddin, and fought
against Qadr Khén, Governor of Likhnant:, and was defeated. A second
time, Fakhruddin fought against Qadr Khiin, and defeated the latter (Qadr
Khin's’own soldiers killing Qadr Ehin), established his rule over Sunargaon
Province, and detached his officer Mukhahs to operate against Lakhnauta.
Ali Mubarik, Adjutant General (Ariz-i-Lashkur) of the Army of Qader Khan
killed Mukhahs, established his own independence (in Lakhnanit), and sent
ont letters to the Emperor Mahammad Shah ‘Tnghiak, who sent ont Mahk-
Yusaf, who died on his way to Bengal. After this, the Emperor bemg engaged
with other affairs, did not sen@ out any others to Bengal For State reasons

a nephew of Suitin Ghidsu-d-din Taghlak Shah, and a cousin of
Soltan Muhammad Shah When Sultén Muhammad Shah
ascended the throne of Delhi, in the first year of his reign, he
appointed Malik Firuz to be hs Secretary. At that time, some
misdemeanour came to pass on the part of Haji Ilyas, foster-brother
of ‘Ali Mubarik, and owing to that he (Haji Ilyas) escaped from
Delhi. When Malik Firuz demanded him from ‘ Ali Mubarik,
the latter searched for him When no trace of his whereabouts
was obtuined, ‘Ali Mubivik informed Mahk Firuz of his escape-
Malik Firuz remonstrating with him, banished him also from his
presence. ‘Ali Mubarik started for Bengal On the way he saw
ina dream Hazrat Shah Makhdiim Jalalu-d-din Tabrizi! (may
God sanctify his sepulchre'!) and showing submissiveness and
humility pleased the saint, who said: “We have bestowed on
you the Sibah of Bengal, but you should build for us a shrine.”
‘Ali Mubarik agreeing to this, enquired in what place the shrine
vas required to be built. The saint replied: “In the town of
Pandtah, at a place where thou shalt find three bricks, one over
the other, and one fresh hund:ed-lenved rose beneath those bricks ;
at that place the shrine should be built.” When.he reached
Bengal, entering the service of Qadr Khan he stayed there. until
gradually he became generalissimo of Qadr Khan's army. And
when Mahk Fakhru-d-din revolting against Qadr Khin, and
killing his benefactor, assumed the reins of sovereignty, ‘ Ali
Mabarik proclaiming himself Sultan ‘Alau-d-din and drawing
his forces against Fakhru-d-din, as has been mentioned before,
avénged the murder of his benefactor, by slaying Fakhro-d-din.
With great promptitude, posting a garrison at Lakhuauti, Sultin
‘Alau-d-din turned his attention to the conquest of other pro-
vinces of Bengal. When he introduced the Khutbah and the

been at Pandiiah, from the circumstance that his coins appear all to
have been minted at Firuzabad (2.c, Pandiiah), Indeed, Pandiiah is known
as ‘Ali Shah's capital.’

\ Shaikh Jalaluddin Tabrizi was a disciple of Shaikh Said Tabrizi.
After travelling for some time, he joined Shaikh Shahabuddin and became
the latter’s Khalifa or chief disciple. He was a great friend of Khwajah
Qutbuddiu and Shaikh Bahauddin. Shaikh Najmuddin the junior who
was at the time Shaikh-ul-Islam of Delhi, bore ill-feeling towards him,
and made false accasations against his piety’ and character, and so
Jalaluddin retired to Bengal. He is buried at the port of Deomahal

coin of the kingdom of Bengal after his own name, becoming
intoxicated with luxury and success, he forgot the injunction of
the saint, so that one nigh6 he saw ina dream the saint, who
said: “‘Alin-d-din, you have obtained the kingdom of Bengal,
but forgotten my bidding.” ‘Alaéu-d-din on the following day
searching for the bricks, and finding them agreeably to the direc-
tions of the saint, erected there a shrine, the trace whereof exists
up tothia time At that time Haji Ilyda also came to Pandiiah.
Sultan ‘Aldu-d-din for some time kept him a prisoner, but by the
intercession of Ilyas’s mother, who was the nurse of Sultan ‘Alau-
d-din, he released him, and giving him an important position
admitted him to his presence. Haj. llyas in a shot time gaining
over the army to his side, one day with the help of eunuchs slew
Sultin ‘Aldu-d-din, and proclaiming himself Shamsu-d-din

The nearest contemporary account of this King will be fonnd in
Tarikh-1-Firaz Shahi p. 686 by Zianddin Barui and Siraj Afif p. 77.

& Sultin Finuzg Shah Tughlak alas Malik Firaz Barbak was a son of
an uncle of Muhummad Shah Tughlak, and a nephew of Ghiasu-d-din
Tughlak Shah. His father was Rajab Salar who_abandonmg all worldly
affairs, became a saint. When fifty years old, in 755 A.H., he was crowned
as Emperor of Hindustan. He was a wise, noble and enlightened sovereign,
He paid special attention to improvement of agriculture and of the econo-
mical condition of the country. He reformed the administration of justice,
pat down oppressions and corruption, lightly assessed land-revenue, and
regulated its assessment aécording to the produce of the lands assessed
and also according to the capacity of the tenantry to bear the assessment,
and abolished octroi daties, He established thirty colleges, founded five
hospitals aud dispensaries, erected forty cathedral mosques and two
hundred caravanserais, twenty monasieries, one hundred palaces and villas,
and one handred and fifty-two baths, and namerons gardens, and bridges.
In the environs of Hansi, he erected a fort called Hisar-i-Firuz, and
joined it by meang of a canal with the river Jumna. His greatest work
was the old Jamna canal; this canal drew its water from the Jumna,
near a point where it leaves the mountains, and connected that river with
the Ghaggar and the Sutle] by mean’ of irrigation channels, spreading
fertility ull around. He caused the translation of several Sanskrit works
into Parsian, and encouraged learning and the learned. He was the recipieut
of a Royal investiture from Abil Fatah Khalif of Egypt. He reigned from
1951 te 88 A.C. The Tughlak dynasty ended in 1414 A.O., the Empire being
shattered by the invasion of Timir in 1898 A.C , daring the reign of Mabmid
Shah Tughluk, the last real Tughlak king. (See Taxikh-i-Firuz Shahi pp. 548

of Rajab, who attempted to re-conque: Bengal. It is said that at
that time Sultan NShamsu-d-din built a bath, similar to the
Shamsi bathot Delhi. Sultéu Firtiz Shih who was furious with
anger against Shamsu-d-diu, in the year 75-4 A.H., set out for
Lakhnauti, and after forced marches reached close to the city of
Panditiah, which was then the metropolis of Bengal. The Emperor
encamped at a place which is still called Firtizpiirabad,! and
riding from that place besieged the Fort of Pandiiah. Sultan
Shamsu-d-din leaving his son with an army in the fort of Pandiah,
entrenched himself in the fort of Ekdalah which was very im-
pregnable. Firfiz Shah, not oppressing the people of Pandtah,
captured in battle the son of Saltau Shamsu-d-din, and marched
towards the fort of Wkdalal?

places it near Dacca, For a discugsion on the site of the fort of Ekdalah,
also see Blochmann’s Contributions to History and Geography of Bengal,
J.A.8., 1873, p. 213 and also Mr. Beveridge’s Analysis of “ Khurshid Jahan
Numa,”

In Tovikh-i-Firug Shahi by Zia ’Barni, Ekdalah is described as follows
(Pers. text, p. 588): “ Kkdalah is the name of 4 monza close to Panduah ; on one
side of it ig a river, and on another uw jungle.” Zia ’Barni ig a contemporary
historian for the period; therefore, thia description given by him fixe he
site of the Fort of Ekdalah near Panduah, and sets at reat all the speculations
to the contrary raised by Mr. Beveridge (in his Analysis of Khurshid Jahdu
Numa). who fixes it near the Bhowal jungle in Dacea district, and also by Mr.
Westmacott who would place it towards Dinajpar. Professor Blochmann is
inclined to treat ‘Ekdalah’ as a gencric name, referring to several places.
See J.A.S.B. for 1878, pp. 212-213. Rennel gives another Ekdalah north of
Dacca “map of Hindustan.’ Shamea-i-Siraj in his Tavikh-Firac Shahi (Pers.
toxt p. 79) calla it the “isles of Ukdalah.”

& The first expedition of Emperor Firuz Shah Tughlak into Bengal (in
764 A.H.=1853 A.C.) is fully and humouronsly described by Zia ’Barni, a
contemporary historian, in the Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi (Pors. text, p. 586), who

ing ground. Sultan Shamsu-d-din thinking that Firnz Shah

closes his history with a nan ative of this expedition and of the events up to the
sixth year of Finuz Shah’s rexgn The object of the expedition was to puash
Suljav Shamsn-d-din Maji Hya. who had mvaded and ravaged Tirhut and
harried the frontier (then the Sro 11ver) between the Bengal Kingdom
and the Delhi Empire. ‘The Emperor set ont from Delhi on 10th Shawal
754 A.TL., reached Qudh, crossed the Sro iver, when Ilyas Shah with-
drew to Tirhat. ‘he Emperor crossing the Sio, marched through Arsa-i-
Kharosah (not identified) and Gorakpir, the Rajahs whereof paid him
homage and enlisted themselves on his side, Ilyis Shih then returned
fiom Tirhut to Pandiah, the Emperor followmg him towards Lakh
nauti.ad Panduah, after traversing Jagat or Jakat (not identified) and
Tunut (the Rayahs whereof also paid homage to the Emperor). Ilyas Shih,
on approach of the Emporor to Panduah, retued to Fo.t Ekdalah, where he
entrenched himself. Tho Emperor did not plunder Panduuh, but left ita
population unmolested, crossed the mver in front of tho fort Ekdalah, and
lad siege to it for several days. He had scruples about destroying promiscu-
ously the garrison of the Fort, so he made a feint retreating movement back
acioss the river, which resulted in drawimg out Hyis Shih from the Fort, A
battle was fought, the Bengal army in which elephants formed a prominent
feature was defeated, and the Impeniahsts captured forty-four Bengal
elephants, &c, &e. On finding that the rainy season was approaching, the
Kmpetror by forced marches (after appointing Collectors in Tirhut district)
returned to Delhi, which was reached on 12th Shaban 755 A H. or 1354 A.C.

This firet expedition is also narrated by Shams Siraj Afif, another nearly
contemporary historian, who continued Rarni's Tarikh-i-Firuz Shihi. (See
Pers, MSS , text p. 76). From this account, the following additional interest.
ing facts are gleaned -—

1. That Firnz Shah sailed to Bengal in one thousand flotilla of war-
vessels, and his route lay across the Sro, the Ganges and the Kosi rivers, that
his expeditionary force consisted of 70,000 Khanans and Malike, two laks in-
fantry, 60,000 vavalry, besides an elephant-corps.

2. That when Firnz Shah ciossed the Kosi river, Ilyas Shah, king of
Bengal, retared from Pandiiah to Hkdalah, which is called here the “ Isles
of Ekdalah.”

8, That Firuz Shah laid siege to the fort of Ekdalah for several days,
and nothing decisive occurring, made a feint retreating movement westward
seven hatoh or Kos from Bkdalah, when Ilyas Shah thmking Firuz Shah
was retreating, came ont of the fort Ekdalah, advanced, and attacked the
Imperialists, wha defeated and killed one lak of the Bengal army, and cap-
tured 60 Bengal elephants,

4. That then Ilyas Shah escaped again to the Fort of Ekdalah, which
was about to be stormed by the Imperialiste, when the females of the garrison

uncovering their heads, exhibited themaelyes, and raised loud lamentations,

had mached to rete, came out of the fort; and mustered his
forces.

Owing to the sword and the arrow and the spear and the
gun,

The market of fighting became warm ou both sides.

The bodies of heroes were emptied of their souls ;

Like roves, on their faces, budded forth wounda.

After much slaughter on both sides, a large number of people
were killed and destroyed. At length, the breeze of vietory wafted
on the standard of Firuz Shah, and Shamsu-d-din being over-
powered fled, and sought refuge im the Fort Jorty-four. elephants
which he had brought from Jajnagar, together with the Royal Um-
brella and the standard and other regal chattels and paraphernaha,
fell into the hands of the soldiers of Firuz Shah. It is said that at
that time the Samt Shaikh Raja Biyabani! in whom Sultan
Shamsu-d-din had great faith, died. Sultan Shamsu-d-din
coming out of the Fort, in the guise of a mendicant, joined the
Shaaikh’s funeral, After finishing the obsequies, he rode alone
to see Firuz Shah, and without the latter recegnizing him, return-
ed to the Fort. When the Sultén came to kuow about it, he
expressed regret. In short, wheu the period of siege was pro-
tracted, and the rainy season set im, in that in the rains, the
country of Benyal becomes one sheet of water, and cause tor
anxiety ariscs, Sultan Firuz Shih made overtures for “peace.
Sultan Shamsu-d-din, who was hard-pressed by the siege, partial-
ly made his submission, and also sought for peace. Firuz Shah,
releasing the sou of Sultén Shamsu-d-din together with other
prisoners of the kingdom of Lakhnauti, raised the standard of
return, And in the year 75§ A.HL, Sultin Shamsu-d-din sent
many presents and numerous rareties, in charge of wise envoys,
to Sultan Firus Shah, The latter also showing attentions to the
envoys, sent them back. And since Sultan Shameu-d-din had

some days at Pandunh, named it “ Firnzabad,” introdaced there the Khufbah
after his own name, and also named “ Ekdalab ” “ Azddpaxr.”

great anxiety from Firuz Shah, consequently in 757 A H. the
former sent to Delhi wise and sagacious envoys, and sought for
peace. Firuz Shah agreeing, returned the envoys loaded with
honours. From that time, the boundaries between the Kingdoms
of Delhi and Bengal were delimitated; and the Emperors of
Delhi adhering to the terms of tho treaty, never meddled with the
Kings of Bengal, and by mutual exchange of presents on both
sides, they maintained friendly relations between the two kimg-
doms. And in the year 758 A.H,, Sultan Shimsu-d-din again
sent from Bengal Malik Taja-d-din with some nobles, in the form
of an embassy, with many presents and gifts to Delhi. Sultan
Firnz Shah bestowing attentions on the envoys more than
before, after some days, sent in return to Sultén Shamsu-d-din
Arab and Turkish horses, together with other valuable presents,
in charge of Malit Saifu-d-din Shahnafil. In the meantime,
Sultan Shamsu-d-din'! nad died in Bengal. Malik Taju-d-din and
Malik Saifu-d-din had approwshed Behar, when they heard the
news of the death of Sultan Shaman-d-din. Malik Saifu-d.din
communicated this intelligence to Delhi, and agreeably to the
order of the Emperor, he gave away the horses and the presents
in lieu of the pay due to the Imperial soldiers statiuned in Behar.
Malik Taiju-d-din returned to Bengal. The wign of Shamyt-d-din

His coms (see p. 58, J.4.8. for 1867), disclose the interesting fact that
several of them were minted at Sunargaon (which 18 termed on the coins
Hazrat Jallal Sunargaon or the Tllustrious Royal Residence of Sunargaon),
bearing dates A.H. 758, 754, 755, 756, 757, 758, His name on the coina is

and the generals, his eldest son, Sikandar Shah, ascended the
throne of Bengal, and spreading the hem of justice and genero-
sity on the heads of the people, proclaimed joyfal tidings of peace
and security. And deeming it expedient to conciliate Sultan Firuz
Shah, he sent, in the shape of presents, fifty elephants with sundry
rareties. Inthe meantime, Firuz Shah, Emperor of Delhi, m
the year 760 A.H. marched! to subjugate the kingdom of Bengal.

1 The object of this second expedition of Emperor Firaz Shih into
Bengal in 760 A,H, (1359 AC.) was to reinstate Zafar Kh in (son-in-law of
Sultan Pakbro-d-din Mubarak Shah, king of Sanargaon) on the throne of

~Sunargaon. See details in Tarikh-i-Firaz Shihi by Shama Siri} Afif (Pers,
MS, text, p.97). From 34, it appears that the Mnsalman throne of Sunargaon
was more ancient than the Masalman throne of Panduah, that on Firuz Shah’s
retarn from Bengal after his firat expedition (this would necessitate a shght
modification of Professor Blochmaan’s date in n- 1 anfe p. 108) Shamsnddin
Nyas Shah sailed and reached Snnargaon in a few days, At that time (755 A-H.
or1354 A-C.) Sultan Fakhru-d-din was reygning in seonrity at Sunargaon.
Shamsuddin took him by surprise, captnred and slew him, and usurped tho
Sunargaon Kingdom, in addition to his Kingdom of Lakhnanti and Pandiahb,
At that time Zafur Khan, son-in-law of Fakhrnddin who was tonring out in the
interior of Sunargaon, to collect revenue and to locally enquire into the condact
of collectors of revenue, heard the above news, sailed on a slop from Sunargaon
by the oeean-ronte to Thatah and thence proceeded to Delhi, ard sought help
from Firaz Shih, Peace was cdneluded with Sikandar Shih, on tho latter
agresing to remstate Zafar Khin in the kingdom of Sunargaon—which how-
ever did nop come to pass, as Zafar Khiin preferred to go back to
Dethi. Like Uyie Shah, Sikandar took refuge in the Fort of Ekdaluh. From
Rengal, Firuz Shih invaded Jajnager (Orissa), defeated the Rajah who made
hig submussion, carried off the idol of Jaganath te Delhi, (p 119) and captured
many elephants. The Emperor's stay in Bengal and Jajnagar duing this
expedition covers 2 yeara and 7 montha (p. 121). In this connection, an
interesting description of Jajnagar is given by Shama Siraj Aful (Tankh-i-
Siraz Shahi, Pera. MS, text, p. 115, andin Muntekhibal Tawarikh (Pers. texts
p, 247, Vol. 1, Fasc. IH, ). Bearing in mind what Zia ’Barni states regarding
Jajnagar in connection with Hmperor Balban’s expedition to Sunargaon, |
am inclined to agree with Professor Bloohmann that there were two Jajnagars ;
one in Orissa, and another towards Tipperah The account in Muntakhiba
Tawarikh referred to above, is slightly different from that in Taiikh-i-Piraz
Shahi by Shams Seraj Afif. Badaoni in Montakbib states that Firuz Shah
after completing his second expedision into Bengal (760 A.H.) returned from
Pandush by forced marches to Jaunpur (p. 247, Mantakhib Pera, text, Vol. 1,
Fase. 111), where he spent the rainy geason, and that at the end of this year,
by way of Behar, he marched into Jajangar (Oresa), passing through Sithi-
ghira, Bargnasi, and crossing whe Mabandri river (the Rajah of Barings

When he reached Zafarabad,! the rains setting in, the Emperor
encamped there, and sent envoys to Sikandar Shah. Sikandar
Shah was in anxiety about the aim of the Emperor of Delhi,
when Firuz Shah’s enyoys arrived. Sikandar Shah immediately
sent his aid-de-camp together with five elephants and other presents,
and opened negociations for peace ; but these resulted in nothing.
After the rainy season was over, Sultan Firnz Shih marched to
Lakbnauti. When the Sultan encamped in the environs of
Panduah, Sikandar Shah feeling that he was no match for the
Sultén followed his father’s tactics, and entrenched himself in the
Fort of Ekdalah. Firuz Shah pressed the siege hard. When the
garrison was reduced to straits, Sikandar Shih sending forty
elephants together with other goods and presents and numerous
rareties, and agreeing to pay an annual tribute, sought for peace.
Firuz Shah accepting these returned to Delhi. After this for
some years, Sikandar Shah with absolute independence gave full
rein to enjoyments. And in the year 766 A.H., he built the
Adina mosque ;*# but before he could finish it, death overtook him,
and the mosque remained half finished. Some trace of the
mosque still exists in the jungles of Panduah, at a distance of one
karoh from the town, The Author of this history has seen it. In

fleeing to Telinga and the Rajah of Sathghira fleeing into a distant corner)
marched into the territory of Rajah Prihan Deo, who sent to the Emperor as
tribute 32 elephants, besides other valuable presents, and thence the Hmperor
merched on hunting expeditions mto the forests of Padmavati and Piremtola
which contained powerful and big elephants, bagged three live elephants, and
killed two elephants, and in 762 A.H. retnrned to Delhi victorious. |

The account in Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi by Shams-i-Siraj ie more reliable,
ag Siraj’s father was with Firuz Shah during the expedition (p. 115)—Siraj
correctly mentions ‘Banaresi’ (which means evidently ‘Katak Banares’, there-
fore, Badaonis ‘Baranaay’ appears to be an error), also names ‘Adabah’ ag Raf
of Jajuagar, also “ Rai Shanied,” also ‘Rai Thud.’ The Rajah of Jajnagar
owned ships, elephants, and lofty palaces constructed of stone, and laid out
with gardens, (p- 116).

L Zafarabad les on the right bank of the Gamti, a little below Jaunpur,
which lies on the left bank. The maps give instead “ Jaffarabad,” which is a
corruption of “ Zaffarabad.” Zaffarabad is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari as
a pergunah in Sarkar Jaunpur under the Subah of Mahabad (Allahabad) —

truth, it is a beautiful mosque, and an enormous sum must have
been expended on its erection. One ought to be thankful for his
efforts. It is said that Sikandar Shah had seventeen sons by his
fist wife, and by his second wife he had’one son, named Ghiasu-
d-din, who, in polish of manners and other qualities, was superior
to his other brothers, and was proficient in the art of government.
Consoquently, the first wife kindling the fire of envy and jealousy
and wishmg the destruction of Ghidsu-d-din, sought for an
epportumty to injwe him One day, finding an opportunity, she
respectfully placed the hand on her chest, in the presenco of the
king, and desired to state her object The king guessing from
the manner of the wife said ‘Speak out what thou hast to say.”
The wite said: “1 would submit my prayer, if the king would
take an oath to fulfilit and try his best to fulfil it.” The king
swore to fulfil it, and indulging in a bit of hyperbole said: * Un-
bosom the desire that thon hast, and make thy lip the mirror of
the dust of thy heart.” The shrewd queen said : “{ am in great
anxiety, in consequ*.ce of the conduct of Ghigsn-d-din. He
is scheming to mount the throne, by killing the king and des-
troying my sous. Although he is in the position of a son to me,
and I do not wish that he should be killed, yet as the safeguard-
ing of the life of the kmg is incumbent, you should not let slip
from the hand the rein of alertness, but provide previously
against any nushap. The best course would be that you should
imprison him, or blind his eyes.” The king on hearing this
became perturbed, and said, “What is this aim of thine
which thou hast mingled with the liquid of my welfare ?,
und what is this fire of envy that thou hast mixed with
solicilude for me¥ Thou feelest no shame that thon hast
seventeen sons, whilst the other frail lady has only thos one
son. What you do not like for yourself, do not desire unto
others.” The queen again anxiously said: “Euvy and jealousy
have nothing to do with my suggestion. The duty that I thonght
incumbent upon myself in the interests of thy well-being, I have
discharged ; after this, my sovereign is at liberty to do what he
pleases.” The king putting the padlock of silence on the portal
of the tongue, kept quiet, and said within himself, “As Ghidsu-
d-din is a dutiful son and possesses capacity for ruling, even if he
seeks to fake my life, let it be so! Happy it is, if the son is
dutiful. nt if he is undutiful, may he perish !” After this, he

107

put the roius of authority entuwely into the hands of Sultan
Ghiasu-d-din. But Ghiasu-d-din, who suspected always the
wiles and stratagems of the queen, one day on the pretext of
hunting escaped towards Sunargaon, and ina short time mobi-
lising a large army, demanded the throne from his father. Short-
ly after, in order to wrest the kingdom, he marched with a large
army from Sunargdou, and encamped at Sunargadhi.! From the
other side, the father also with a powerful army advanced. On
the next day, on the battleficld of-Goalpara,? both sides marshall-
ing their forces prepared to fight.

The son shewed malice towards the father .

Blood flowed from the perturbed heart.

The father snapped the ties of kindness and affection :
You might say that love had vanished from the world.

Although Ghiisu-d-din had given strict oraers to his soldiers
and commanders that to the utmost they should capture the king
alive, but as fate willed otherwise, Sikandar Shah was unknow-
ingly killed at the hands of one of the commanders of Ghiasu-d-
din, Whilst still the slayer was standing at his head, one amongst
them seemg Sikandar Shah killed, enquired as to who had killed
him. He said: “I have killed him; ” the other man said, “ You
felt no pity for Sultén Sikandar.” Then both in fright went to
Ghidsu-d-din and said: “In case we fear that by restraining
our hands, we may be killed, can we kill him?” Ghidgn-d-din
said ; “ Certainly yon may kill him,” and after some reflection he
said: “ Apparently, thon hast killed the king.” The slayer said :
“Yes, unknowingly I inflicted a cut with the spear on the heart
of the king. Still he has some rewnants of life.” Ghidgu-d-din
proceeded swiftly, dismounted from the horse, and placed the
head of the father on his lap, and teais trickled down his cheek,
and he said: “Father, open thy eyes, and express thy dying

wish, that I may fulfilit” The king opened his eyes, and sard :
‘* My life’s work is over , the kingdom is welcome to thee.

May you prosper in your sovereignty,
As I have quitted the world.”

After he said this, the bird of his soul flew away. Ghiagu-
d-din seeing no good in tarrying further, left behind some nobles
to attend to the obsequies of his father, and himself rode forward
towards Panduah, and ascended the throne. The reign of
Sikandar Shah! lasted nine years and some months. He was a
contemporary of the saint ‘ Alaul Haq?

THE REIGN OF GHIASU-D-DIN, SON OF SIKANDAR
SHAH.

When Sikandar Shah was laid in the grave, the throne of
Bengal received eclat from the accession of Sultan Ghidgu-d-din,
First blinding the eyes of his step-brothers, he sent them to their
mother, and freed himeelf from anxiety as to the wiles of his
brothers, After this, he commenced dispensing justice, and
throughout bis life lived at rest and ease. It is related that once
Sultén Ghidgu-d-din falling seriously ill despaired of life, and
selected three maids from hi> harem, one named Sarv, the

Hiy name from coins (see pp. 65-67 J.A.8., 1867), appears to be “ Abul
Majahid Sixandar Shah.” Some of bis coing are of Suuargaon mint.

& Shaikh 'Alaaddin Alaul Haq died on the lst Rajab, 800 A.H. or 20th
Harch, 1808, and bis tomb is at, Panduah. A short biographical sketch
of this saint is given by Professor Blochmann in J.A.8.B., p. 262 for 1873,
Hig son and aucceasor was Shaikh Naruddin Nir Quth Alam who died in 351
A.H, or 1447 A.G., and lies buried at Pandush. Nir Qutb Alam wae succeed

4 On the coins, he is called “ Ghiayaddin Abil Muzaffar Azam Shah.’
(See Thomas's Initial Coinage of Bengal, J.A.8. for 1867, pp. 68-69), His
tarly coins were minted at Muazzamabad in- Eastern Bengal, and he held
court at Sunargaon, during the lifetime of hia father, Sikandar Shah, against
whom he rebelled. His conrt was an asylam for the learned and the cultured,
and he wae himself a just and righteous goversign, and a man of light and
sweetness. Hoe invited the illustrious Persian poet Hafiz to his court. Hig
tomb is at Senargaon (Bee pi. 8 in J.A.8. 1874, p. 36.)

second named Gul, and the third named Lalah, to perform the
last bathing ceremony. When God granted him recovery, consi-
dering them auspicious he bestowed attentions on them more than
before. The other maids from envy used to taunt them
about the bathing, so that one day whilst the king was in a jolly
mood, they related to him this affair. The king recited the
following line—

“ Cup-bearer, this is the story of Sarv (the cypress) Gul (the
Rose) and Laleh (the Tulip").

The second line of the verse could not be suppued, and none
of the poets attached to court could supply it. Then the king
writing this line, sent it with an envoy to Shamsu-d-din Hafiz to
Shiraz. Hafiz! quickly supplied the next line :—

is not devoid of ingenious excellencies, and he sent also another

In short, Sultan Ghidsu-d-din was a good ruler, and adhered
strictly to the injunctions of the sacred law. For instance, it is
related that one day whilst at arrow-shooting, the king’s arrow ac-
eidentally hit a widow's son. The widow sought for redress from
Qazi Siraju-d-din, The Qazi was in anxiety; for if he shewed
partiality towards the king, he would be held culpable before the
tribunal of God, and if he did not do so, the summoning of the king
would be a difficult affair After much deliberation, he sent a
peon to summon the king, and himself sat on the tribunal of justice,
placing a whip underneath the masnad. When the Qazi’s peon
reached the palace, finding access to the king impossible, he com-
menced shouting out the call to prayer (Azan). The king hearing
this untimely call to prayer, ordered the Muazzin (caller to prayer)
to be brought to his presence. When the Reyal servants carried
the latter to the royal presence, the king enquired as to this un-
timely call to prayer. He (peon) said. “ Qazi Sirdju-d-din has
deputed me, in order that I may take the king to the tribunal of
justice. Since access to the king was difficult, I adopted this
device to obtain access. Now get up, and come to the tribunal
The widow's son whom you wounded with an arrow, is the com-
plainant.” The king immediately got up, and concealing a small
sword under his arm-pit, set out. When he appeared before the
Qazi, the latter not at all paying attention to the king, said:
“ Consolate the heart of this old woman.” The king consolated
her in a way that he could, and said : “ Qazi, now the old woman
is satisfied.” Then the Qazi turning to the old womai anquired,
“Have you received redress and been satisfied?" Ihe woman
said: “ Yes, I am satisfied.”! Then the Qazi got up in great
delight, ané showing respect to the king, seated him on the mas-
nad. The king drawing out the sword from his arm-pit said :
“ Qazi, in obedience to the injunctions of the sacred Law, I have
appeared at your tribunal. If to-day I found you deviating by
one hair-breadth from adherence to the injunctions of the Law, with
this very sword I shonid have severed your head. God be thank-
ed, that everything has been all-right.” The Qazi also drew his
whip from underneath the mansad, and said: “ Sire, if to-day I
found thee in the least transgressiug the injunctions of the sacred

“A calamity had come but has ended well.” The king, being
pleased, bestowing gifts and presents on the Qazi, returned. The
king from the begimmng had great faith in the Saint Nur
Qutubul ‘Alam, and was Ins contemporary and fellow-student,
for both took their lessons fiom Shaikh Hamidn-d-din * Kunjna-
shin Nagori. At length, m the year 775 A.H., by the stratagems
of Rajah Kans who was a zemindar in that part, the king was
treacherously killed The reign of Ghidgu-d-din lasted seven
years and some months, and according to another account, it lasted
sixteen years, five montha aud three days.’

} Thia story speaks volumes in favour of the purity of the admmistration
of justice that must have prevailed in the latter part of the fourteenth
century ander the Masalman régime in Bengal. History fails to furnish an
instance that can surpass this, in exemphfymg the honesty and sense of daty
of a humble peon, the judicial fentlessness and integrity of a yndga, and the
law-abiding nature of a king.

2 Shakh Hamid of Nagor belonged to Nagor in Jodhpiir.

8 For Coinage of this King, see Thomas’s Initial Coinage, J A.S B , 1867,
pp. 68-70.

From the circumstance that his early coins were struck at the mint-town
of Muazzamabad (territory whereof has been identified to have extended from
the Megna ta north-eastern Maimansingh and the right bunk of the Surma),
it would appear that he first acquired power in Eastern Bengal, and reigned
first at Sunargaon, from which place according to the Riyaz he marched out to
fight against his father, Sikandar Shih, who reigned at Pandnah. Snlyan
Ghidsu-d-din must have invited Hafiz to his court at Sunargaon, (as Hafiz
died m 791 A.H.,) when, according to Sikandar Shih’s coins noticed by Mr.
Thomas, Sikandar Shih yet ruled at Panduah. (See also J A.S. for 1873,
p. 258).

* On the coins he is catled Saifu-d-din Abn! Majahid Hamzah Shah, son
of Azam Shih (see J.A.S. for 1873, p. 259) Ferishta says: “The Rajahs of the
country did not draw their heads ont of the yoke of obedience, and did not

styling him Sultiin-u-s-Salatin.

One goes out, and another comes in in his place :
Tue world is never left without a master.

He was sober in character, and generous and brave. He
reigned over Bengal for ten years, and in the year 785 A.H. he
died, and according to another account, he reigned three years
and seven months and five days. God knows the truth

REIGN OF SHAMSU-D-DIN,! SON OF SULTANU-S.-
SALATIN.

After the death of Sultdnu-s-Salatin, his son, Shamsu-d-din,
with the consent of the councillors and mombers of Government,
ascended the throne, and according to ancient usages he observed
the ceremonies attendant on assumption of sovereignty, and fora
period was at case and comfort. In the year 788 A.H. sither by
some natural disease, or by the stratagem of Rajah Kans, who at
that time had become very powerful, he died. Some have written
that this Shamsu-d-din was not an actual but adopted son of
Sultdno-s-Salatin, and that his name was Shahabu-d-din. Either
way, he reigned for three years, four months, and six days. And
the true account is, that Rajah Kans who was zamindér of Bath.

neglect or delay in paying revenne to him.” According to the Tabayat, he
reigned 10 years, The coins discovered of him, were struck at Firazabad
(or Panduah).

t Beriahte says, that as she hing was young and weak in intellect, an
infidel named Rajah Kans, who was attached to the court, usurped the
exeoutive and collection of taxes. ‘he Tabagat says that the king died after
& quiét and peaceful reign of three years und a few months.

Professor Biochmann identifies this king (whose coins haye not heen
discovered} with king Shahabu-d-din Abil Mazaffar Bayazid Shah, whose coins
are noticed by Professor Blochmann in J.A.8, p, 263, for 1873, Bayazid
Shih, according to Professor Blochmann’s ‘theory, was “a puppat king--a
benami transaction,” whilst Rajah Kins ruled over Bengal.

USURPATION OF RAJAH KANS! ZAMINDAR.

When Sultén Shameu-d-din died, Rajah Kans n Hindi
Zamindar, subjugating the whole kingdom of Bengal, seated him-
self on the throne, and commenced oppressions, and seeking to
destroy the Musalmans, slew many of their learned and holy
men. His aim was to eatirpate Islam from his dominions. It
is said one day Shaikh Badrul Islam, father cf Shaikh Muinu-d-
din ‘Abbas, sat down before that wretch, without saluting him.
Thereupon he said - “ Shaikh, why did you not salute me?” The
Shaikh said: “It is wet becoming’ for the learned to salute
infidels, especially a ernel and blood-shedding infidel, like thee,
who has shed the blood of Musalmans.” On hearing this, that
unholy infidel kept silent, and, coiling hke the serpent, aimed at
lalling him. One day he sat in a house which hada low and
narrow entrance, and sammoned in the Shaikh. When the Shaikh
arrived, he guessed the Rajah’s object, so he first put ont his
legs inside, and afterwards not bending the head, entered: ‘That

nanda river and the Parnabhaba, its tribatary, in the sonth by the left bank
of the Ganges, in the east hy the Karataya, and in the north by Dinajpur and
Ghoraghat. Bhatariah therefore 1s the district to both sides of the Atrai
river.” Professor Blochmann (J 4.8.B. for 1875, p. 287), identifies “ Bha-
turiah” as part of old Barendra, in Rajshahi proper, between Amril and
Bagura, and signifying Northern Rajshahi Proper including Tahirpur.
Professor Blochmann also considers, that the nsme “ Rajshahi” is connected
with Rajah Kans, who was a Rajah-Shah, that is, a Hinda Rajah who
agcended a Masalman throne.

1 Phe Tabaqat-i-Akbari merely notices Kane’s uaurption, Ferishia says
that though nob a Musalman, Kans was a friend (S:¢.) of Musalmans. The
Riyaz gives the best account based ptrhaps on local craditions, Mr. West.
macott innecurately identifies “Rajah Kaas” of Bhathumal with Raja
Ganesh of Dinajpor.” Professor Blochmanu (I think correctly) identifies
“Rajah Kane” with “Rajah Kans Naiayan” of Tahirpur which latter is
included in Bhathuriah. (See J A.8.B., p. 287 for 1875),

Rajah Kaus does not appear to have issned coins in his own name, but
during hig régime, posthnmous coins of Azam Shah (noticed by Hon’ble Sir
B. C. Bayley in J.4.8., 1874, p. 294n.) and coins in the name of Shahabudin
Bayazid Shah, a puppet king or a, benami king (noticed by Professor Bloch«
mann in J.4.8.B. for 1873, p. 263), were issued,

Rajah King from the testimony of coins appears to have reigned from
810 AH. to 817 A.H, or 1407 to 1414 A.O. but he appears to have actnally
nsuyped the government eaylier in 808 AH.

placed in a line with his brothers. Immediately, the Shaikh was
killed, and the rest of the learned that very day were placed on a
boat and drowned in the river. The Saint Nir Qutbu-l-‘Alam
becoming impatient by reason of the oppressions of that infidel
and his slaughter of the Musalmans, wrote as follows to Sultan
Ibrahim Shargi! who ruled at that time up to the limits of Behar :
‘The ruler of this country, named Kans, isan mfidel. He ig

of the learned and holy men, and destroyed them. At present,
he is aiming to kill the remainder of the Musalmans, and to extir-
pate Islam fron. this country Since to help and protect Musal-
mans, is a duty meumbent on Musalman sovereigns, accordinly I
intrude on your valuable time with these few lines. I pray for
your auspicious arrival here, for the sake of tho residents of this
country, and also in order to oblige me, so that Musalmana
may be rescued from the oppressive load of this tyrant. Peace

1 Shamsu-d-din Ibrahim Shah Sharqi, king of Jaunpur, reigned from 804
to 845 A.H. (1401-1441 A.C.) The Sharqi kingdom was created in 795
A.H, by Sultin Mahmiid, son of Sultan Alauddin Sikandar Shah, gon
of Snitin Muhammad, son of Sultan Firoz Shih Toghink, owing to the
increasing feablene.s of the Delhi Empire. The Sharqi kingdom, extended

opened it with great respect, and read it. Qazi Shahabu-d-din !
Jaunpuri who was one of the scholars of the time, and the chief
of the body of the learned men, and who was highly respected by
Sultan Ibrahim who used to seat him ona silver chair on auspi-
cious occasions, also used his great persuasions and said: “ You
ought to set out quickly ; for in this mvasion both worldly and
religious benefits are to be obtained, namely the country of Bengal
will be subjugated, and you would also meet the Saint Shaikh
Nir Qutbu-l-‘Alam, who is the fountain-head of both worldly
and eternal boons, and you would also be doing a pious deed by
avenging the oppression of Muhammadans” Sultau Ibrahim
pitching out his tents struck the kettle-drum of march, and
making forced marches, in a short time, with a powerful army
reached Bengal, and encamped at Firuzpur* Rajah Kans, on
hearing this news, was confounded, and hastened to wait on the
Saint Qutbu-l‘Alam. Showing submissiveness and humility,
and weeping, the Rajah said: ‘ Pray, draw the pen of forgiveness
across the page of the offences of this sinner, and dissuade Sultan
Tbyaéhim from subjugating this country.” The Saint replied:
“In order to intercede on behalf of an oppressive infidel, I cannot
stand in the way of a Musalman sovereign, especially of one who
has come out at my desire and request.” In despair, Kans pros:
trated his head on the feet of the Saint, and added, ‘ Whatever
the Saint may bid, I am willing to submit theroto.” The
Saint said: “So long as thou dost not embrace the Musalman
religion, I cannot intercede for thee.’ Kans assented to this
condition, buf his wife casting that misguided man into the
well of misguidance, prevented his conversion to Islém. At
length, Kans brought to the presence of the Saint his son named
Jadii who was twelve years old, and said: “ I have become old, and
desire to retire from the world. You may couvert to Isldém this

son of mine, and then bestow on him the kingdom of Bengal.”
The saint Qutbu-l-‘Alam taking ont from his own mouth some
chewed betel, put it into Jadi’s mouth, and making him pronounce
the creed of the Musalman faith, converted him to Islam, and
naming hiw Jalalu-d-din, had the fact proclaimed in the city, and
caused the Khutha of the kingdom to be recited after his name
The ordinances of the sacred Muhammadan law from that day
were again put in force. After this, the saint Qutbu-l-‘Alam
went to meet Sultan Ibrahim, and after making apologies, prayed
that the latter might withdraw The Sultan was annoyed at this
request, and turned his face towards Qazi Shaha&bu-d-din. The
Qazi said: “ Saint, the king has come here at your requisition ,
and now you yourself siding with Kans, appear as his agent ; what
ig youraim?” The Saint said “ At that time (when I made the
requisition) an oppressive ruler was tyranuising over the Musal-
mans ; now owing to the augpic.ous arrival of the Sultan, he has
embraced the Muhammadan faith The Jihad (or holy war) is
enjoined against mfidels, not against Musalmaus.” The Qazi,
finding no answer, kept quiet. But as the-Sultdn’s temper was
irritated, in order to soothe the Sultan, the Qazi commenced
testing the learning and miracles of the saint, and was discoinfit-
ted. After much questions and answers, the Sait said - “ To view
with contempt saints and to try to test them, ends im nothing but
discomfiture. Before long, thou shalt die in a wretched plight”
And the saint at the same time cast an angry glance toward» tho
Sultan. In short, the Sultan, annoyed and vexed, returned to
dJannpir. Itis said that shortly after Sultan Ibrahim and Qazi
Shahabo-d-din Jaunpuri died.

‘ Whoever quarrels with saints, suffers.’

Rajah Kans hearing that Sultin Ibrahim bad died, displaced
Sultan Jalilu-d-din, and himself re-ascended the throne. According
to the injunctions of his false creed, the Rajah prepared several
gold-figures of cows, shoved in Jalalu-d-din through their mouths,
and pulled him out from their buttock-sides, and then distributed
the gold of those cow-figures among the Brahmans, aud thus re-
perverted his sou to his own creed. As Jalaln-d-din, however, had
been converted by the Saint Qutbu-l-‘Alam, he did not abandon
his faith in Islam, and the persuasious of the infidels had uo effect

on his heart. And Rajah Kans again unfurling the standard oi
misbehaviour, attempted to destroy and extirpate Muhammadans.
When his cruelties passed all bounds, one day Shaikh Anwar, son
of the Saint Qutbu-l-‘Alam, complained to his father of the
oppressions of that tyrant, and said: “ It is a matter of reeret that
in spite of such a holy saint of the time as yourself, Musalmans
should be oppressed and ground down by the hand of this infidel.”
The saint at that time was absorbed in prayer and devotion. On
hearing this utterance of his son, the saint was enraged, and
replied: “ This tyranny shall ecase only, when thy blood shall be
shed on the carth.” Shaikh Anwar knew full well that whatever
fell from the lips of his holy father, was sure to come to pass, and
so after a moment, said: “ What you have said about me, is meet
and proper; but in respect of my nephew, Shaikh Zahid, what is
your will?” The saiut said: “ The drum of the virtues of Zahid
shall resound till resurrection-day.’”’ In short, Rajah Kaus extend-
ing more than before his oppressions and cruelties, gradually
oppressed the servants and dependants of the saint himaeclf,
plundered their effects and chattels, imprisoned. Shaikh Anwar
aud Shaikh Zahid. As he had heard the Saints’ prophecy about
Shaikh Zahid, not daring to kill him, he banished both to Sunir-
gion, aud sent orders to his ageuts there, that after ascertaining
from them the whereabouts of the hidden treasures of their
fathers and grandfathers, they should slay both. And on the
Shaikh’s arrival at Sundrgdon, they perpetrated many cruelties,
yet not finding any clue to the hidden treasures which did not
exist, first they murdered Shaikh Anwar, and when they attempt-
ed to take the life of Shaikh Zahid, the latter stated that in a
certain village a large cauldron was hidden. When they dug it
up, they found a large chatty, but did not find more than one
gold coin in it. They enquired, ‘“‘ What has become of the rest ?”
Zahid said: “Apparently some one has stolen it.’ And this
affair was the outcome.of a miracle. It is said that on the very day
and at the very moment when Anw&r was murdered ab Sundrgaon,
and his sacred blood shed on the earth, Rajah Kans passed away
from his sovereignty to hell. According to some accounts, his
son, Jalalu-d-din, who was in prison leagued with his father’s
servants, and slew him. The rule and tyrauny of that heathen
lasted seven years.

KANS.

After this, Jalalu-d-din mouuted the throne with full inde-
pendence. He converted, contrary io his father, many inhdels
to the Moslem faith, and compelled the Hindis who had tasted of
the gold-made figures of cows, to eat beef And calling back the
saint Shaikh Zabid from Sunargaon, he paid him every respect
and honour, and rendeting him services, was very often in atten.
dauce on him. He managed the affairs of Government in an
efficient manner. In his reign, people passed their lives in ease
and comfort. Itis said that m his time tho town of Panduah
became sv populous that 16 cannot be dencribed. At Gaur, he
erected a mosque, a resevoir, the Jalali tank aud a carayanserai.
The city of Gaur commenced being re-populated in his time.
He reigned for seventeen yearn. In the year 812 A,H3 he
removed the capital back again fo Gaur. ‘lo this day, a large
tower exists over his mausoleum at Pandual. The graves of his
wife and his son lie by the sides of his mausoleum.

When his oppressions reached the utmost limits, and the low and
the high were exasperated to desperation by his tyranny,

the rank of nobles intrigued, and killed Ahmad Shah; and this
event occurred in 880 A.H. His reign lasted sixteen years, and

REIGN OF NASIR KHAN, THE SLAVE.

When the throne became vacant by the murder of Ahmad
Shah, Shadi Khan desired to put Nasir Khan out of the way
and to become himself the Administrator-General of the kingdom.
Nasir Khan, guessing his design, forestalled him, and slew Shadi
Khan, and boldly placing himself on the throne, commenced to
enforce orders. The nobles and the Malik of Ahmad Shah not
submitting to him, slew him. His reign lasted seven days, and
according to another account, half a day.

Mahmid Shih. With him commenced the restoration of the Ilyas Shahi
dynasty in Bengal. He reigned for thirty-two years in peace (this peace
being probably due to the wars that then prevailed between Jaunpur and
Delhi), and according to another account for ‘ not more than twenty-seven
years,” and died in A.H. 862. In the histories, he ia simply called Nagir
Shah. Dates of his reign, as ascertained from coins and inscriptions, are
846; 861; 868, whilst the earliest dates ascertained for the reign of Barbak
Shih, Mahmid Shah's saccessor, is 865 Mahmid Shah therefore must have
reigned till the beginning of 864 A.H. If his reign lasted twenty-seven years,
this would pat buck the commencement of lus reign to 836 (the year in which
Marsden’s Ahmad Shah's coin was struck), and render Moahmiid Shih an
opposition king during 14 years of Ahmad Shih’s reign which 1s doubtful.
Inscriptions of this king from Satgaon, Dacea, and Gaur have been published.

REIGN OF FATH SHAH, SON OF YUSUF SHAH.

After thé death of Yisuf Shah, his son Sikandar Shah,!
ascended the throne. He had a little touch of lunacy. Ashe
had no capacity for this important function, the nobles and the
leaders deliberating that very day superceded him, and raised to
the throne another son of Yisuf Shah, named Fath Shah. The
latter was wise and sagacious. Observing with wisdom the
usages of the rulers and sovereigns of the past, and bestowing
on the nobles dignities according to their individual ranks, he
pursued a liberal policy towards his subjects. In his reign, the
gates of happiness and comfort were thrown open to the people
of Bengal. It was then the established custom im Bengal for
five thousand paiks to turn out every night with music, and for
the king to go out for a while in the morning to receive their
salute, and then to give them leave to depart, a new corps of
paiks relieving them. One day, the eunuch of Fath Shah, bear-

REIGN OF BARBAG, THE EUNUOH, STYLED SULTAN
SHAHZADA.

Barbag the eunuch, the faithless miscreant, after slaying his
own master, placed himself an the throne,according to the saying —
When a forest is untenanted, jackals give themselves the

airs of lions,

{ Stewart calls him a “ youth of the royal family’; other histories say
nothing about his relationship. The Ain-i-Akbari gives him half a day; the
Tabagqat gives him two and a half days; Ferishta gives no period, and
Stewart gives him two months (J.A.S for 1873, p. 281).

& His name from coins and inscriptions (1.4.8, for 1873, p 281), appears
to be Jalalu d-din Abul Muzaffar Fath Shah. Heppears from nstories to
have reigned from 887 to 896 A.II.; but inscriptions and coins shew that he
reigned in 886 A.H. Some of his coins were struck at Fathabad (Faridpiir
town) in 886 and 892 A.H. These together with the msermptions on Babi
Salih’s mosque at Bandar, near Dacca (dated 886 A H. or 1482 A.C.), of

He styled himself Sultéu Shahzida.’ He collected together
vonuchs from all places; and bestowing largesses on low people
won them over to his side, and attempted to enhance his rank
and power. Finding that only his own peers would come within
his clutches, he tried to destroy the high and influential nobles.
Oué of these, the premier-nobleman, Malik Andil, the Abyssinian,
who was on the frontiers, becoming apprised of the ennuch’s
designs, planned to set his own capable son on the throne, and
to finish off the eunuch's life-work. At that time, the doomed
eunuch thought of summoning Malik Andil, in order to im-
prison him by means of a trap; then he issued orders sum-
moning him Malik Andil guessing the real significance of the
summons, with a large number proceeded to meet the eunuch.
Since the Malik observed great precaution in his mgress to and
egress from the darbar, the eunuch despaired of destroying him.
Tn consequence, one day, the eunuch arranging an entertainment,
showed great intimacy towards Malik Andil, and placing a Qoran,
said. “Place your haud on the Holy Book, and vow that you will
not injure me.” Malik Andil vowed, “So long as you are on
the throne, I shall do you no injury.” Inasmuch ag all the
people were designing to destroy that miscreant eunuch, Malik
Andil also schemed to avenge the murder of his benefactor, and
leaguing with the porters sought for an opportunity. One night,
whilst that miscreant was intoxicated by excessive indulgence in

_liquor, and lay asleep on the throne, Malik Andil, being led in
by the porters, entered the harem, to kill the eunuch. When he
found the latter asleep on the throne, he hesitated, on recollecting
hie vow. Suddenly, that miscreant over whom a fatality was
hanging, by the will of Povidence which flings one from the
throne of pride down to the dust of degradation, and places on
another’s head the crown of sovereignty, owing to his intoxication
from liquor, elipped down from the throne. Malik Andil was
delighted at this incident, and drew his sword on him, but did
nob succeed in despatching him. Sultan Shahzada, awaking, and
seeing himself in front of an unsheathed sword, seized Malik
Andil, and boing strong, in the wrestling, threw down the latter,
and saton his chest. Malik Andil who held tightly the hair of
the eunuch’s head, did not let it go, but shouted out to Yugrush
Kbén who was standing outside the room, to come up quickly.
Yugrugh Khau, the Tark, with a number of Abyssiniana, instantly

came in, and finding Malik Andil underneath the eunuch, hesi-
tated in attacking with the sword. In the interval of search,
the lights had fallen under the Hands and feet of the two wrest-
lers and had got extinguished, and all was dark. Malik Andil
shouted ont to Yugrush Khan, “I am holding the hair of the
eunuch’s head, and he is so broad and robust, that his body has
become in a way my shield; do not hesitate to strike with your
sword, since it will not penetrate through, and even if it does,
it does not matter; for I and a hundred thousand like me can die
in avenging the death of our late master.’ Yugrush Khan gent-
ly inflicted some strokes with his sword on the back and shoulder
of Sultan Shahzada, who feigned being dead Malik Andil then
got up, and along with Yugrush Khan and the Abyssinians, went
out, and Tawachi Bashi, entering the bed-room of Sultan
Shahzada, lighted up the lamp. Sultan Shahzada, fancying
him to be Malik Andil, before the lamp was lit, from fear not
mounting the throne, had escaped into a cellar. Tawachi Bashi
proceeding towards the cellar, entered if; then again Sultan
Shahzada feigned being dead. The Bashi cried out: ‘It isa
pity that rebels have killed my master, and ruined the kingdom.”
Sultan Shahzada, fancying him to be one of his own loyal
adherents, cried out: “ Look here, hold your peace, for I am
alive,” and enquired where Malik Andil was Tawachi said:
“Thinking that he has killed the king, he has returned home with
peace of mind.” Sultan Shahzada told him, “ go out, call together
the nobles and set them to fetch Malik Andil’s head, after killing
lim, and place watchmen in charge of the gates, warning them
to be armed and on the alert.” Tawachi the Abyssinian replied :
"Very well, now I go to effect a radical cure.” Coming ont,
he quickly told the whole affair to Malik Andil, who again went
in, and inflicting cuts with the dagger, finished off the eunuch's
life, and leaving his corpse in that cellar, locked it, and coming
out sent a person to summon Khan Jahan, the Vizier. And after
the arrival of the Vizter, he held a, council for the election of a king.
And since the son of Fath Shah was only two years ald, the
nobles weré diffident as to how he could be placed on the throne,
so that, in the morning, all the nobles being of one mind went
to the house of the widow-queen of Fath Shah, related to her
the story of the night, and said: “ As the prince is a child, you
should appoint one to manage the affairs of Government, until


--- Page 151 ---
124

the prince comes ot age.” The queen, on learning their anxiety,
knew what to say. She said: ‘I have made a vow to God tbat
I would bestow the kingdom on the person who kills the
murderer of Fath Shih.” ! Malik Andil, at first, declined to
accept the burden of kingdom, but afterwards, when all the
nobles collecting in that assembly unanimously besought him,
he mounted the throne. The period of Sultan Shahzddi’s
reign according to one account was eight months, and,
according to another account, two and a half months. After
this incident in connection with Sultan Shahzada, for some
years, is became the ruling practice 1» Bengal that whoever
slew the ruling king, and got an opportunity to seat himself on
the throne, became recipient of homage and submission of the
people, who did not protest against Ins installation? Inone pam-
phlet, the period of the rule of Sultan Shahzada is stated to be
six months. God knows the truth.

ei into Bengal, became from the protectors of the dynasty the masters of the
kingdom, and eunuchs were the actaul rulers of the country. . . . What
royalty at that time waa in Bengal is well described by Abnl Fazl, who says
thot after the murder of Fath Shih, low hirelmgs flourished ; and Ferishta
sareasticully remurke that the people would obey him who had killed a king
and usurped the throne.” Blochmunn’s Contr. (J.A.S. for 1873, p. 286).

Hiruz Shah, and proceeding to the metropolis of Gaur established
himself there. In the directions of justice and liberality, he put
forth noble efforts, and secured for his subjects peace and comfort.
In that, during the time he was a noble, Malik Andil had done
great and heroic deeds, both his soldiers and subjects dreaded him,
and did not lean towards disaffection. In liberality and generosity,
he was matchless. Ina short time, he bestowed on the poor the
treasures and largesses of past sovereigns, who had hoarded
the Same with considerable exertions and pains. It is sad
that on one occasion in one day he bestowed on the poor one
lak of rupees The members of Government did not like this
lavishness, and used to say to one another: “This Abyssinian
does not appreciate the value of the money which has fallen into
his hands, without toil and labour. We ought to set about dis-
covering a means by which he might be taught the value of money,
and to withhold his hand from useless extravagance and lavish-
ness.” Then they collected that treasure on the floor, that the
king might behold it with his own eyes, and appreciating its value,
might attach value to it. When the king saw the treasure, he
enquired : “ Why is this treasure left in this place?” The members
of Government said. ‘This is the same treasure that you allotted
to the poor.” The king said “How can this amount suffice?
Add another lak to it.’ The members/of Government, getting
confounded, distributed the treasure amongst the beggars. Malik
Andil, after reigning for three years, in 899 A.H. fell ill, and the
light of his life was extinguished by the breeze of death. But the
more reliable account is, that Furoz Shah also was slain at the
hands of the Paike.t A mosque, a tower and a reservoir in the
city of Gaur, were erected by him.

{ For a humourous description of the cowardice of the Bengal Paihs (an
Infantry corps of Bengal) in the time of Sultan Ilyas Shah (1853 A.C.), see
Tarikh-i-Viruz Shahi by Zia’ Barni (Pers. text, Fasc, 7, p. 593), from which the
following is translated: “And the well-known Bengal Paike who for years
dubbed themeelves “ Abn Bangal,” and gave themselves martial airs, and pro-

THE REIGN OF SULTAN MAHMUD, SON OF FIRUZ
SHAH.

When Firuz pnah passed to the secret-honse of uuu V1stence,
the noblea and the ministers placed on the throne his eldest son,
named Mahmid. And an Abyssinian slave, named Habash Khan,
became the Administrator-General of financial and administrative
affairs, and his influence so completely pervaded all affairs of
government, that, except a bare title, nothing of sovereignty was
left to Mahintid Shah, and the latter was compelled to live in this
way, until another Abyssinian, who was called Sidi Badr Diwana,
despairing of his ways, killed Habash Khan, and himself became
the Administrator of the affairs of government. After some time,
leaguing with the commandant of the Patks, at night-time, he
killed Mahmid Shah, and next morming with the concurrence of
the nobles of the palace, who were m league with him, he as-
cended the throne, assuming the title of Muzaffar Shah. The
reign of Mabhmid Shah lasted one year And in the history of
Haji Muhammad Qandahari, it is related that Sultan Mahmid
Shah! was a sou of Fath Shah, Jaghn Khan,’ o slave of Barbag
Shah, under order of Sultan Fitz Shah, trained him up; and
after the dexth of Sultan Firiz Shah, Sultan Mahmid was placed
on the throne. After six months hal passed, Hahash Khan,
harboured notions of sovereignty m his head. Mahk Badr
Diwdna killing Habash Khan, as has been rolated before, himself

mounted the throne.

learned and the pious and the nobility of the city, and also killed
the infidel Rajahs who were opposed to the sovereigns of Bengal.
He bestowed on Syed Husain Sharif Maki the office of Vizier,
and made him Administrator of the affairs of Government. And
he became assiduous in hoardmg treasure, and hy the connsel
6f Syed Husain, he eut down pay of soldiers, and set about
building a treasury, and he commited oppressions in the
collection of revenue Consequently the people, receiving in-
juries at the hands of Muzaffar Shah, became disgusted with
him. Gradually, Syed Husam’s mimd was also changed, so that
matters came to this pass, that in the year 903 A.H., most of the
principal noblemen, seceding from the king, went out of the city,
whilst Sultén Muzaffar Shah with five thousand Abyssinians and
three thousand Afghéus and Bengalis entrenched himself in the
fort of Gaur, For a period of four months, between the people
inside, nnd outside, the city, fightings raged, and daily a large
number of people were killed! Té 1s said that, daring the period
Sultén Muzaffar was entrenched in the fort, whenever any one
was captured and brought before him, he used to kill him with the
sword with his own hand, with a ferocity characteristic of the
Abyssinians, so that the number of people killed by him amounted
to four thousand, At length, Muzaffar Shah,’ sallying out with
his force trom the city, gave battle to the nobles, whose leader
was Syed Husain Sharif; and from both sides, twenty thousand
men fell, either by the sword or the arrow.

L This sanguinery civil war in Bengal, about the end of the fifteenth
century, between the Royahats on one side and the people on the other, headed
by the nobles, reminds one of a similar war between king John and hus barona
in England, and illustrates that the people in Bengal were not “dumb, dnven
cattle,” bat that they had sufficien. political life and strength and powers of
organization to control the monarchy, when its acts exceeded all constitutional
bounds, as set by the Shara’ or Muharsmadan law. Indeed, Moslem monar-
ohies, wherever established, (barring mdividual aberrations) have been consti+
tutional in the strict sense of the word, from the time, when, in the seventh
century, the first Khalifate was established in Arabia (see Sir W. Muir's
“ Annals of the Early Oaliphate ”),

At length, the zephyr of victory wafted on the standard of
the nobles Muzaffar Shah. with a number of his associates and
adherents, was killed on the field. And according to the state-
ment of Haji Muhammad Qandahazi, during that time, from the
beginning to the end of the war, one lakh and twenty thousand
people, of both Musalman and Hindu persuasions, passed to the
regions of destruction, And Syed Husain Sharif Maki, gaining
the throne, mused the standard of sovercignty. And in the
history of Nivamu-d-din Ahmad, it is related that when the
people got disgusted with the miseonduct of Muzaffar Shah, Syed
Sharif Maki becoming aware of this stute of national disgast, won
over to his side the Commandant of the Household troops and, one
night, with thirteen men entering the inner chambers, slew Muzaffar
Shih, and next morning mounted the throne, and proclaimed
himself Sultdn ‘Alin-d-din. The reign of Muzaffar Shah lasted
three years and five months A mosque, amongst his other build-
ings, exists at Gaur.

THE REIGN OF ‘ALAU-D-DIN SYED HUSAIN SHARIF
MAKI

Syed Husain Sharif Maki, during the period of his Vizarat,
used to treat the people with affability. He used to tell them:

1 Nizimi-d-din Ahmad was Bakhshi under Akbar, and was a patron of
the historian Badnoni. Nizimi-d-diu completed hia history called Tabagit-i-
Akbari in 1590 A C.; he is the firat writer who gives a concise counected
account of the Independent Musalman kings of Bengal from 1838 A C, to
1588 A.C,

8 His name on coins and inscriptions (vide J.A.S.B for 1873, pp. 292-293),
is “ Alan-d-din Abii] Mazzafar Husain Shah, son of Syed Ashraf-al-Hnesini ”
Nowhere on coins and inacriptions is he called “‘ Sharif Maki,” asin the text.
The Tabayat-t-Akbarl simply calls him “ Alanddin”; Ferishta erroneously
calls him “ Syed Sharif Maki”; whilst Stewart incorrectly calls him “Sharif
Mecca.” He reigned from 898 to 927 A.IT. (according to coins and inscriptions).
Tho Riya: states that Alanddin, after arriving as an adventurer in Bengal,
settled at a place called Chandpur in Radha district (Western Bengal), tut Pro-
fessor Blochmann (J,A.8.B. for 1873, p. 228n.) ia inclined to identify the Ohand-
por in question near ‘Alaipor or ‘Alau-d-din’s town,”on the Bhariab, east of
Khulna, in Jessore district, as the place where the Husain dynasty of Bengal

independent kings had its adopted home, because Husain Shah jirst obtained
power in the adjacent district of Faridpur or Fathihibad (which latter at the
tame was included in, or rather melnded portions of, Jessore), where his firs;
coing were situck in 899 AH (Marsden’s pl, XXXVIII, No, DOCLXXIX), and
also because Husain Shih’s son, Nasiat Shah, erected a mint at the neighbonr-
ing place of Khalitatibud (or Bayerhat, formerly m Jessore district) and
minted thre coins in the lifetime of hus father in 922 AH. (see p, 297;
J A.8.B, for 1873 and pl. IX, No, 10). Anotho: circamstance which also sup-
ports the above theory of Professo. Blochmaun about the locule of Alau-ddin
Hussain Shal’s adopted home, appears to be this, that the names of
Husain Shah, his brother Yusuf Shah, and his sons Nasrat Shah, and Mahmid
Shah, are found in connection with several parganas of Jessore (Jasar) district
(as formerly constituted, before its being split up into Pabua, Khulna and Farid-
pur districts), sach as parganas Nasratshaihi and Mahmiidshahi and Yusuf-
Shahi, and Mahmidabad (a whole Sirkar inclading No.thern Jessore or Jasar
and Bosnah). In regard to Alauddin Husain Shih, Professor Blochmann
observes (J.AS. for 1873, p 291) that “ ut the reiun of no king at Bengal—~
perhaps of all Upper India betore the middle of the 10th century—do we
possess so many inscriptious. Whilst the names of other Bengal kings
scarcely ever occur 1n legends, and remain even unrecognized in the geographi-
eal names of the country, the name of ‘Husain Shah the Good’ is still
remembered from the frontiers of Orissa to the Brahmapnira,’ This great
and good king extended his empire into Orissa, into Assam, into Chittagong,
and reigned over all north Behar, and all south Behar up to the western
limits of Sarkar Monghyr, where his son Danyal erected o vault over Lhe
shrine of Peer Nafa, (See T.baqat-1-Akbari and also Badaoni, Vol. I, p. 371).
A cathedral mosque amongst his other edifices was erected by this king, in
907 A.H. at Machain, opposite to Faridpur in Dhakah ; the inscription of this
mosque appears m J.A.S. for 1873, p. 293. The Husain Shahi dynasty con-
sisted of four suvereigns: (1) Alauddin Husain Shah who reigned from 899 to
929 A.H. (2) Alau-d-din’s son, Nagirn-d-din Abul Mazaffar Nagrat Shih (929
t0 939). (3) Alan-d-din Piruz Shah (939), a son of No. 2, and (4) Ghiasu-d-din
Mahmiid Shih, (940-945 A.H.) the last Independent king of Bengal, who was
defeated by She. Shih’s army at Gaur under Jalal Khan and Khwas Khan
in 944 A.H. or 1588 A.D. That 18, for forty-four years, this Hugaini dynasty
consisting of four kings, reigned ove: Bengal (Seed A.S.B. for 1872, p 332),
The Taongat-i-Akbari’s notice of Bengal closes with an acoonnt of the reign
of Nasrat Shah, the second king of the above Husaini dynasty. The fourth
king of the Husaini dynasty, it may be of interest to remark, is the “ Bl Ray
Mamnd de Bengaln” of the Portuguese, who desciibed Gaur, the capital at the
time, as being “three leagues in length, well-fortified and with wide and
straight roads, along which rows of trees were plunted to shade the people.”
Thia Mahmad Shah died in 945 A.H. at Colgong (Kahalgaon), where he lies
buried.

nobility, and dissuade him from evil pursuits, it is all in vain; for
he is simply bent on hoarding wealth.” In consequence, the nobles
looked upon Husain as their friend, patron and sympathiser. As
his virtues and Muzaffar Shah’s vices were known to the public
and to the elite, on the day that Muzaffar Shab was slain, all the
nobles held a council for the purpose of electing a king, and
favoured the installation of Syed Sharif Maki, and said, “If we
elect you king, in what way will you conduct yourself towards
us?” Sharif Maki said: “I will meet all your wishes, and im-
mediately I will allot te you whatever may be found over-ground
in the city, whilst all that is under-ground I will appropriate to
myself.” The patricians as well as the plebeians fell in with this
tempting offer, and hurried out to pillage the city of Gaur, which
at this time eclipsed Cairo (in point of wealth).

In this way, a city was pillaged :
You might say, it was swept by the broom of plunder.

Syed Sharif Maki by this ensy contrivance, seized the
umbrella, of sovereignty. and introduced the Khutba and the coin
in his own name. Historians write that his name ‘was Syed
Sharif Maki,' and that when he ascended the throne, he styled
himself ‘Alau-d-din. But I note that throughout the kingdom of
Bengal and in the neighbourhood of Gaur, his name as Husain
Shah is on the lips of the eli#é and the mass. Since I did not find
the name of Husain Shah in history, I was in donbt,
After much research, by deciphering wordings of inscriptions
which exist up to this day, and are engraved on the ruins of the
City of Gaur, on the stone of the large gate-way of the
Qadam Rasiil building,’ and on the Golden Mosqne, and also on
some other shrines, which are amongst the edifices erected by
Saltén Husain Shah and his sons Nasrat Shah and

L The Tabaqat-i-Akbari and Badaont (p. 317 vol. 1) simply call him
Alanddin (which however was obvionsly the Jalts name), Ferishta erro-
neously calls him “Sayid Sharif Maki,” whilst Stewart incorrectly calls
him “Shiref Mecca,” erroneously led no doubt by the remark of the
‘Riyaz’? whose author thenks that Husnin’s father or one of his ancestors
might perhaps have been a Sherif of Mecca. The Alamgirnamah (p. 780)
calls him Husain Shah.

® The inscription dated 937 A.H. on the Qadam Rasiil building at Gaur is
published in J.A.5.B. for 1872, p, 838; in it Nagrat Shih is described as son ol
Husain Shah, son of Syed Ashrafal Husaini.

Mahmid Shah, it appears that Syed ‘ Alau-d-din Abil
Muzaffar Husain Shah is the son of Syed Asghrafal-Husaini. In
regard to the months and years of Syed Sharif Maki’s period, all
these inscriptions tally, and thus all doubts are set at reat. It
appears that apparently his venerable father—Syed Ashrafal
Husaini—was Sharif of Makka; hence the son also was known as
Sharif-i-Maki; or else, his name was Syed Husain. In a
pamphlet, I have noticed that Husain Shah and his brother Yisnf,
together with their father, Sayyid Ashrafal Husaini, were residents
of the town of Tarmiiz.! By chance, they came to Bengal, and
stayed in the mouzad of Chandpur in the zilla of Radha,? and both
the brothers took their lessons from the Qazi of that place. On
knowing their noble pedigree, the Qazi married his daughter to
Husain Shah After this, he entered the service of Muzaffar
Shah, and reached the office of Vizier, as has been related before.
When he ascended the throne in the city of Gaur, after some days,
he forbade the people from the pillage of the city, and when they
did not cease, he slaughtered twelve thousand plunderers ;
then these stayed their hands from the work of pillage. And
making search, he found much of the hidden treasures including
thirteen hundred plates of gold. From ancient times, the
custom in the country of Lakhuauti and East Bengal was
that rich people preparing plates of gold, used to take their
food thereon, and on days of carnivals and festivities, whoever
displayed a large number of golden plates, became the object
of pre-eminence. And this custom up to this time prevails
amongst the rich and high-ranked people. Sultdn ‘Alau-d-din
Husain Shah, since he was a wise and sagacious sovereign,
shewed considerateness towards the influential nobles, and raised
his select officers to high positions and trasty offices. And he
prohibited the Paiks—whose faithlessness and regicides had be-
come characteristic—from guarding the Palace, and totally dis-
banded them, so that no harm might befal him. And in place
of the Paiks, in the Guard-room and on the Band-stand, he appoint-
ed other body-guards. And he also expelled totally the Abyssini-
ans from his entire dominions.

Since these Abyssmians were notorious for their wickedness,
regicides and mfamous conduct, obtaming no footing in Jaun-
por and Hindustan. they went to Gujrat and the Dakhin. Sultan
‘Alau-d-din Husain Shah, girding up the waist of justicc, unlike
othor kings of Bengal, removed Ins seat of gover ument to Ekdala,
Which adjoins the city of Gaur. And cacepting Husain Shah, no one
amongst the kings of Bengal made Is seat of government anywhere,
except at Pandua and the city of Gaur. Ashe was himself of noble
descent, according to the saying, “ Every thing turns back to its
origin” hoe took the Sycds, Mughals and Afghans by the hand,
and sent efficient District Officers to different places, so that peace
in the country being secured, anarchy and revolutions which had
occurred during the poriod of the Abyssinian kings, ctc., vanished>
and all disloyal clements were reduced to order. And subjugat-
mg the Rajas of the cnvirons and conquering up to Orissa,
he levied tribute. After this, he planned to conquer Assam, which
is north-east of Bengal With an overwhelming army consisting
of infantry and a numerous ficet, ho marched towards that king-
dom, and conquered it. And conquering the whole of that country
up to Kamrup, Kamtah and othor districts which were subject
to powerful Rajas, hke Rip Narain, and Mal Kunwar, and Gasa
Lakhan and Lachmi Narain and others, he collected much wealth
from the conquered tracts; and the Afghans demolishing those
Rajas’ buildings, crected new buildings. The Raja of Assam
not being able to oppose him, relinquishing his country, fled to the
mountains. The king, leaving his son! with a large army to

in the Alamgirnamah pp. 730 and 731 and the Assam Baranji (J.A.8., for
1874, p. 281). Husain Shah’s conquest of Kamiip and Kamta (western Assam)
is also chronicled in a contemporaneous inscription of 907 AH. (1501 AC.) in
a Madrasah or College founded by Husain Shih at Gaur. This inscription 1s
also published in J.AS., for 1874, p. 308. Husain §hah’s firat Governor of
Western Assam or Kamrup was his son, Prince Danyal,—-the same prince who
erected the vault over the shrine of Pir Nafa im Monghyr fort in 908 A.C.,
whilst reburning from a mismon on behalf of his father to meet Sultan
Sikandar Lodi in Behar, and immediatly before setting ont on this Assam
expedition (Badaoni, p. 317 Vol. 1). He was followed as Governor of Assam by

triumphant and victorious to Bengal After the withdrawal
of the king, his son devoted himself to the pacification and defences
of the conquered country But when the rainy scason sct in, owing
to floods, the roads and tracks hecame closed , and the Rajah with
his adherents issued from the hills, surrounded the Royal army,
engaged in warfare, cut off supplicsof provisions, and in a short
time put all to the sword. And the king, erecting a fort on the
bank of the river Bhatah,! bestowed great cfforts on the
improvement and advancement of the Kingdom of Bengal And
erecting and establishing Mosques and Rest-honses at different
placcs in every district, ho conforred numerous gifts on saints
and recluses.2 And for the maintenanco of the Rest-house in connec-
tion with the eminent samt, Nur Qutbu-l-‘Alam, he endowed
several villages, and every year, from Ekdala, which was the
seat of lus government, he used to come to Pandun, for pilgrimage
to the bright shrine of that holy saint’ And becanse of his meed-
worthy courtcousness and affable deportment, and owing to the

THE REIGN OF NASRaT SHAH, SON OF ‘ALAU-D-DIN
HUSAIN SHAH

When Sultan ‘Alau-d-din Husain Shah died, the adherents of
the kingdom and the members of the government placed on the
throne his eldest son, named Namat Shah, commonly known as
Nasib Shah, who was wise and just, and well-behaved, and in
affairs of administration was more proficient than hig other
brothers. The most laudable work that he performed was that,
instead of imprisoning his brothers, he doubled the offices which
had been conferred on the latter by their father. And capturing
the Rajah of Tirhiit, he killed him. And he set two officers,
named ‘Alju-d-din and Makhdum ‘Alm, otherwise known as Shah
‘Alim, and who were sons-in-law of Husain Shah, for the conquest
of the limits of Tirhiit and Hajipur,? and posted them there. And
when Emperor Babar, killing Sulfén Ibrihim,’ son of Sultan

1 His name, as appearing on his coms and insoriptions, is Nasira-d-din
Abul Mozzafar Nasrat Shah (See JASB. for 1873, pp. 296 and 297),
Historians call him also Nasib Shih, (Badaoni, p. 348), but perhaps whilst as a
prince, he held the name of Nasib Khan. He appears to have reconquered
Chittagong Tract (see Tarkh-i-Hamudi and J.A.S8, for 1872, p. 886), and to have
subdued Tirhiit and Hajipur tracts in North Behar—and to have also held
temporary sway over Azimgarh in the N.~W. Provinces (see Sikandarpiir
Azimgarh inscription published in J.A.S. for 1878, p. 206), Kharid mentioned
in this inseryption is on the right bank of the Ghegra river.

Nasrat Shah reigned from 929 to 989 A.H. (J.A 8. for 1872, p. 332),

§ Hajipar was long the head-quarters of the Bengal Governors of Behar
from the time of Hap Ilyas, and was founded by Haji Ilyas alas Shaman-

head-quarters to Patna, on the establishment of Mughal rule under Emperor
Akbar,

Sikandar Lodi, conquered the great empire of Hindustan, many
of the Afghan Omra escaping, sought refnge with Nasrat Shah,
And at length, Sultan Mahmid,! brother of Sultan Ibrahim, .
being expelled from his kingdom, came to Bengal. Nagrat Shah
showing kindness to every one, bestowed on all pargannahs and
villages, in accordance with their respective rank .and condition,
and consistently with the resources of his kingdom. And he
married Sultan lbrahim’s daughter, who had also come to
Bengal And planning the subjugation of the Mughal forces, he
despatched Qutb Khan with a large force towards the environs
of Bharaich® And the latter fought several battles with the
Mughals, and for a period the contending forces were bivouacked
there, fighting. But Khan Zaman,’ son-in-law of Emperor Babar,
had conquered up to Jaunpur, and when in the year 930 A.H.,
Emperor Babar came to Jaunpur, and brought to his subjuga-
tion all its limits and environs, and planned to march to Bengal
and to bring it also under his domination, Nagrat Shah, foreseeing
the result, sent valuable presents and gifts in charge of wise envoys,
and offered submission. Emperor Babar, in view of the exigencies
of the times, made peace with Nasrat Shah, and retired. When
Emperor Babar died on the 5th of the month of Jamadiu-l-Awal

India was transferred. from Afghan hands to those of the Mughals, Strange
enongh to add, this revolution was effected by the intrigues of Afghan officers
and Qmara of Ibrahim who had joined Babar, and invited the latter to
India, (Badaon:, Pera. text, p. 331, Vol. 1), No doubt, :t was a penalty paid
by Sulfin Ibrahim for his ill-treatment of his brothers, officers and noblemen,
whom he constantly distrusted and disgraced.

as a King by Hasan Khan Mewati and Rana Sanka, and mdaced to fight

ing under his tyranny In that interval, Nasrat Shah rode to
Aknakah, in the city of Gaiir, in order to visit the tomb of his
father. As will would lave it, there he punished an eunuch for
some fanlt. From fear of life, this eunuch leagued with other
éimuchs, and murdered Nagrat Shah on his return to the palace,
in the year 943 A.H. His reign lasted 16 years, and according
to some, 13 years, and according to others, less than 18 years.
The foundations of the building of Qadam Rasil* in the year
939,5 and the Golden mosque commonly called the Sona Musjid*
in the year 982 A.H., were laid by him, and these with their
Shattered doors and walls exist tothis day, amongst the build-
ings of Nagrat Shah, sou of Sultan ‘Aldu-d-din Husain Shah,
amidst the ruins of Gafir. And the foundation of the luminous
shrine of the saint Makhdiim Akhi Siraju-d-din 5 at Sadu-l-lahpur
is also amongst the noble relics of that monarch.

engraved on stones exist to this time, the king’s name is mentioned
as Nasrat Shah, son of Sultan ‘Alau-ddin Husain Shah. In

REIGN OF FIRUZ SHAH,' SON OF NASRAT SHAH.

When Nasrat Shah drank the disarreeable syrup of death,
his son, Firuz Shah, by the counsels of tle grandees, ascended the
throne. He had reigned for three® years, when Sultan Mahmid

Husain Shah, and whom Nagrat Shih lid installed to the rank
of a nobleman, and who in the life-time of Nasrat, conduéted
himself like an ameer, finding an oppurtunity, slew Firuz Shab,
and ascended the throne by right of inheritance from his
father

Delhi and in course of time acqnired great lewrning. He was then sent to
Bengal, where he died in 758 A.H. or 185 A.}, After Niznmu-d-din’s death
(according to the Heft I glim), he went to sakhnanti—(See J.A.8. for 1873
p. 260).

Nasrat Shih could not have laid the oundation of the Saint’s shrine;
he could have only repaired and improved it, for the inscription on the shrine
(see J,A.8. for 1878, p 294), shews that its door was built by Nasrat Shah’s
father, Sultan ‘Alau-d-din Husain Shah, in 916 A.H. (A.C. 1510).

Akhi’s pap:l was the Samt Alau-l-FHug, father of the Saint Nir Qutb

Akhi was a contemporary of Shamsn-d.din Abul Muzaffar Llyas Shah,
King of Bengal.

REIGN OF SULTAN MAHMUD,! SON OF ‘ALAU-D-DIN.

When Mabmiid Shik ascended the throne, Makhdim ‘Alam,
his brother-in-law, wh» was Governor of Hajipur, raised the
standard of rebellion, and intrigued and allied himself with Sher
Khan, who was in the tract of Behar.2 Mahmid Shah depnted
Qutb Khan, Commandas.b of Monghyr, to conquer the Province of
Behar, and to chastise I nkhdtid ‘Alam. Sher Khan made efforts
to conclude peace, but tiey were of no avail; and at length, by
the concurrence of the Afghans, resolving to die, he determined
to fight. When the tw» forces closed together, a great battle
ensued. Qutb Khan was killed in the battle and Sher Khan,
obtaining his elephants and baggage, became powerful, After
this, Makhdim ‘Alam, in oruer to avenge himself, or to usurp
the throne, raised the siandard of rebellion, and fighting with
Mahmid Shah, was killed. And Sher Khan Afghan instantly,
who had usurped the throne of Delhi,’ drew his force towards
Bengal, The nobles of Bengal, guarding the passes of Teliagadhi

Ghiigu-d-din Abul Muzaffar Mahmud. Shab (See J.A.S8. for 1872, p. 339, and for
1878 p. 298). He wasthe last ncewendent King of Bengal, and reigned from
940 to 944 AH. He isthe “E Rey’ Mamud de Bangala,” with whom the
Portuguese Alfonso de Mellu made » treaty. At this time, Sher Khan and his
brother Adil Khan had deserted th) Mughal cause, and gone over to the side
of the King of Bengal. Bat aubs:quently Sher Khin on the pretext of aveng-
ing the murder of Firnz Shah, mide war on Mahmiid Shah, besieged him at
Gaiir, and. Mahmiid Shah fled to Colgong (Kahalgaon), where he died in 945
A.H, (1538 A.C.) of injuries received on the battle-field. (See Badaoni,
p. 348, Vol. I).

2 The town of Behar is meant. It appeara that at this time both Sarkar’
Monghyr in South Behar and the whole of North Behar were subject to the
Bengal kings, and Najipur was the head-quarters from a long time of the
Bengal Governor of North Behar, West of Sarkar Monghyr in South Behar,
which was subject to the Sharq! kingdom of Jaunpur, on the decay of the
latter kingdom, fell into the hands of semi-independent Afghan chiefs,
ineluding Darin Khan, his son Ashadar Khan (who proclaimed himself
Sultan Mahwnmed), Sultan Mahmiig, and Sher Khan. Ab this time,
asthe text shews, Makhdim ‘Alam, Mahmiid Shih’s brother-in-law, who
was his Governor o? North Behar, aud had his head-quarters at Hajipur,
also rebelled agaisst his sovereig:, ond intrigued with Sher cS

and Sakrigali! for one month continued fighting At length,
the passes of Teliagadhi and Sakrigali were captured, and Sher
Khan entered Bengal, and Mahmid Shah, drawmg his force,
encountered the former, when a great battle ensued. Sultan
Mahmiid, being vanquished in the field, entrenched himself in the
citadel, and sent a message to Emperor Humayun in Delhi,
seeking for help Humayun Shah in the year 944 A H. turned to-
wards the conquest of the province of Jaunpur. Since at that
time, Sher Khan was in Bengal, Emperor Humayun going to the
foot of the fort of Chunar,* laid siege to it. Ghazi Khan Sir, who
was in the fort on behalf of Sker Khan, raised the standard of
opposition, and for six months the siege was protracted.’ By the
efforts of Riimi Khan,’ ladders being mounted, the fort was
scaled and captured by Humayun. Sher Khan also put’ forth
grand efforts for capturing the fort of Gaiir, and the garrison
were hardpressed. But asin the meantime one of the zamindars
of Behar, becoming refractory, raised disturbance, Sher Khan,
finding it mmexpedient to hali at Gaiir, left his son, Jallal Khan,
and Khawiis Khan, one of his trusty nobles, to besiege the fort
of Gai, whilst he himself marched back to Behar. And Jallal
Khan, son of Sher Khan, skirmished with Mahmiid Shah, so that
the garrison were reduced to straits, and food-grains became
scarce in the city. On Sunday, the 13th of the month of Far-
wardi, corresponding to the 6th of Zil-Qadh, 944 A.H.,° Jallal

Khawas Khan, slave of Sher Khan. (Bee Badaoni, p. 349, Vol. 1).

described “as a stone-fort iu the summit of a hill, scarcely equalled for ita
loftiness and strength” The river Ganges flows at its foot—Ain-i-Akbari
(Jarrett’s Tr., Vol. 2, p 159)

8 It is stated that its siege by Emperor Humayun commenced on 8th
January, 1538 A.C. Asits siege lasted six months, and as it was stormed before
Gaiir fell (on 6th April, 1588 A.C.) into the hands of Sher Shah’s general,
Khawas Khan, the siege of Chunar musth have commenced in October 1587
A.C. (See Tankh-1-Sher Shahi), or it may be that the fall of Gair took place
in July 1588 A.0. (See Badaoni, pp. 348 and 349, Vol. 1).

Khan with other grandees, such as Khawas Khin, etc., struck up
the kettle-drum of battle. Sultén Mahmid, who was hard-
pressed by the siege, sallymg ont of the fort, advanced to fight.
Since the period of ns fortune had turned to declension, and the
luck of Sher Khan assisted the latter, Sultan Mahmid, unable
to cope in battle, escaping by the way of Bhatn,! fled, and
Mahmid Shah’s sons were taken prisoners; and the fort of Gair,
together with otlter booty, fell into the hands of Jallal Khan,
son of Sher Khan Jallal Khan and Khawés Khin, entering
the fort, engaged in slaughter and capture and plunder of the
garrison. Aud Sher Khan also, being set free from the distur-
bance in Behar, pursued Sultau Mahmiid. When they clored
each other, Sultén Mahmid was obliged to fight, and receiving
@ serious wound, fied from the battle-field. Sher Khan, victorious
and triumphant, spurred on to Gaiir, and became master of
Bengal. The Cathedral Mosque at S‘adu-l-lahpur,* amongst the
buildings of Sultan Mahmiid, son of Sultan ‘Alau-d-din Husain
Shah, exists to this day. From the imscriptions engraved on it, it
appears that he was a son of Sultan ‘Alai-d-din Husain Shah.
The period of his reign appears to have lasted five years.5

At the time when Sultan Humayun the Emperor captured the

of march towards the conquest of Bengal. Sher Khan,* learning
about this; despatched Jallal Khan and Khawas Khan to defend
the pass of l'eliagadhi, which leads to Bengal And this Telia-

and Bengal, itis very impregnable; itis flanked on one side by a

Emperor Humayun detached Jahangir Beg’ Mughal to capture
Teliagadhi and Sakrigali On the day that Jahingw Beg reached
that place, just after he had dismounted, Jalléil Khan and
Khawas Khan, marching up quickly with an efficient force,
attacked him. The Mughal forces, unable to cope, were van-

Humayun himself marchet up to Teliagadhi and Sakrigali,
Jallél Khan and Khawas Khan, seeing their inability to stand the
Emperor’s onslaught, fled towards the hills, and from thence, to
Sher Khan at Gair. The Imperial army, forcing its way easily
through that narrow defile, marched up, stage by stage. And
when the Imperial camp halted at Kohal Gaon (Colgong),

that his two sons who had been taken prisoners by Jallal Khan,

8 Sher Khan or SherShah was at this time at air and had made
himself master of it (Seo Badaoni, pp. 843 and 349, Vol. I), Mughal historians,
to please the Mughal Emperors, invyriably belittle Sher Shah by calling him
“ Sher Khan ” Sher Shah finally defeated Humayun (Jarrett’s Tr., Ain, p. 421,

day by day, and in a short time died.!- And since Sher Khan, on
hearing about the approach of the Imperial forces, became
anxious, he removed the treasures of the kings of Gair and
Bengal, fled towards Radha,? and from thence towards the hills
of Jharkand.§ Emperor Humayun captured without opposition
the city of Gair4, which was the capital of Bengal, and owing to
the ominous nature of its name, hechanged it to Jinnatabad, and
introduced the Imperial Khutba and coin. The ports of Sunar-
gaon and Chatgaon (Chittagong), etc., came into the possession of
the Emperor. For some time, the Emperor lived in ease and
comfort, and did not pursue Sher Khan, and made light of the
enemy. Three months had not yet passed, since his stay in that
city, when owing to the badness of the climate of that place, many
horses and camels died, and many soldiers fell ill. Suddenly,
the news was received that the Afghans, marching by way of
Jharkand, had captured the fort of Rohtas,’ and that leaving
a force for the defence of the fort, Sher Khan himself had march-
ed to Monghyr, and had put to the sword the Emperor's grandees
who were there. And the news of the successful rebellion
of Mirz& Hindal which had come to pass at Delhi,® was also
received. The Emperor becoming anxions on the a receipt of the

4 Homayon captured Gair, about July 1588. Humiyun stayed at Gair
for three months, that is, till Beptember 1538 A.C., and named the place
Jinnatabad. (See Badaoni, p 349, Vol. I).

5 This important fort in South Behar was captured by Sher Shah in 945
A.H. or about September 1538 A.C by an ingonious stratagem. (See Badaom,
n.-849, Vol. I). Sher Khan indaced the Rajab of Rohtads to give shelter to
his family in the Fort, and then sezt im there two thousand armed Afghans
in mahfas or palanquins; these latter killed the Rajah and his soldiers,
and easily captured the Fort for Sher Shab.

Mirza Hindal had raised the standard of rebellion m Agrah and Mewat, had
caased the Khutba to be recited after his own name, and had killed Shaikh

THE ACCESSION OF SHER SHAH? TO THE THRONE,
IN THE CITY OF GAUR.

When Emperor Humayun 1m the year 946 AH. withdrew
towards Agra, Sher Khan, apprised of the unpreparedness of the
Imperial army and of the :ebellion of Mirza Hindal, set out fiom
the fort of Rohtas with a large army. And at the time, when
the Imperial camp arrived at Chansa, capturing the Ingh way,
for three months Sher Khan bivouacked facing it, and caused
as much harassment as he could. At length, by way of treachery
and stratagem, sending to the Emperor Shaikh Khalil, the
well-known saint who was his spimtual guide, Sher Khan sought

might be left on the road by an old woman, during her sleep.

Ghausa and Baksar. The river here is called Thora Nadi, The battle of

for peace. The Emperor, owing to the exigencies of the timer,
accepted his overtures,! and 1t was agreed that Bengal and the
fort of Rohtas would continue in the possession of Sher Khan,
and that the latter would put forth no further pretensions, but
that the Imperial coin and Khutba would be in force in those
provinces. Sher Khian, taking his oath on the holy Qoran,
accepted these terms; and the Imperial army were re-assured
by this oath. But Sher Khan, on the following day, with an
efficient and well-equipped Afghan force, taking the Imperial
army by surprise, did not allow it time to rally into ranks, and
after fighting became victorious, and closed the ferries where
boats were moored Owing to this cause, the king as woll as the

straitened, and being hardpressed by the Afghans, plunged pell-

nearly twenty thousand Mughals got drowned, The Emperor

the end of the year, leaving Khiar Khan to rule over Bengal, he
himself started for Agra, And from that side, Humayun’s force,
despite the fraternal dissensious, consisting of one hundred.

RULE OF KHIZR KHAN AT GAUR.

When Khizr Khan was appointed Governor of Bengal on
behalf of Sher Shah, he married a daughter of one of the kings
of Bengal? and in his mode of living, and in his paraphernalia
of comforts and luxuries, observed: the kingly mode, And when
Sher Shih at Agra came to know about this, exercising fore-
sight, he deemed it proper to adopt remedial measures against
the disease before it shewed itself, and swiftly marched to Bengal.
And when Khizr Ihan went forward to receive him, Sher Shah
imprisoning him, divided the province of Bengal amongst several
tribal chiefs, and appointed Qazi Fazilat, who was one of the
learned scholars of Agra, and who was distinguished for his vir-
tues, honesty and trustworthiness, to be the over-lord, and
entrusting to his hands the power of making peace and war in the
country, he himself returned to Agra.

till end of December 1539 A.C. at Gair, and tlien leaving Khizr Khin as his
Governor of Bengal, he marched towards Agra, (Budaoni, pp. 352 and 864

When in the year 952 A.H., Sher Shah, in capturing the fort
of Kalinjar,) by the will of Providence, was accidentally burnt
by the explosion of the gunpowder of a mine that had been laid
underneath tne rampart, and his younger son, named Jallal
Khan, ascended the throne of Delbi and assumed the title of
Islam Shah, popularly known as Salim Shah, Muhammad
Khan Sur, who was one of the principal Omra and a connexion of
Salim Shah, and who was renowned for his justice and equity and
courteous deportraent, was appointed Governor of Bengal. And for
some years until the end of Salim Shih’s reign he continued so, after
which he raised the standard of rebellion, and turned towards the

ments that he introduced at this time in Bengal, viz, of placing different
tribal chiefs to rule over different territorial divisions would indicate that he
was fully ahve to the pohcy ‘Divide and rule.” His installation of Qazi
Fazilat, a scholar of Agra,in a position of over-lordship over these tribal
chiefs, farther ndicates that he set a high value on Iearning Sher Shah died
on 12th Rab I, 952 A.H (8rd June, 1545) ; he lies baried at Sahsram, mn South

career, and also Badaon1, p. 865, Vol. I, Finshta and Akbarnamah,

Sher Shih was the first ruler who from a king of Bengal, became the

RULE OF KHIZR KHAN, STYLED BAHADUR SHAH.!

When Bahadur Shah, with an efficient army, imvaded Bengal,
Shahbaz Khan, who, on behalf of Muhammad Shah ‘Adli, was at
that time Governor of Gaiir, advanced to fight. The grandees of
Shahbaz Khan, seeing the overwhelming force of Bahadur Shah,
deserted to the latter. Shahbaz Khan, with the remnant of the
soldiery who held on to him, resolved to fight, and was slain on

the battle-field.

the battle of Chapparghatta. He reigned over Bengal as king from 962 to 968
AH, (or 1555 to 1561 A.C.) Badaoni calls him Mubammad Bahadur. The
most important event of his reign was his war with ‘Adh Shah, whom he
defeated at the deciave battle of Surajgarha in Monghyr district, m 964 A.H.
At this battle, Salamin Kararani who held South Behar from Shor Shah's
reign assisted Bahadur Shah. (See Tarikh-1-Daudi and Badaom, pp. 488-484,

Muhammad Shih ‘Adli detached a large army in pursuit
of him. Im the environs of Chaprampiir, which is forty kro
distant from Akbarabaid and thirty io distant from Qanauj,
the two fo.ces encountering each other, a battle was fought,
when Taj Khan being routed, retired towards Chanar. On
the way, winning over certain Revenue Collectors of the
Crown-lands cf Muhammad Shah ‘Adli, he levied from them in
the shape of cash and goods whatever he could, and taking one

from Gwalior with his army against the Karanians, and on the
bank of the Ganges, the two armies encountered each other,
Hemi! the grocer, who was the generalissimo of Muhammed
Shah ‘Adli’s army, taking with him one halg@h of elephants, and
crossing the river, and fighting, became victorious. And when
Tbrahim Khin Sur,* who was ‘Adli’s sister’s husband, escaping
and capturing Delhi raised troubles, Muhammad Shih ‘Adi was
compelled to leave the Karanians, and to march back towards
Delhi. And the Karanians thus became independent. And, as
has been related, when Taj Khan reduced to his subjection the
City of Gair, after nemly nine years ruling over it, and conquer-
ing the kingdoi of Bengal, like others, he died.

REIGN OF SULAIMAN KARANI3

In the beginning of his career, Sulaimin Karani was one of
the giandees of Sher Shab. Sher Shah appointed him Gover-

caligsumo under Muhammad Shah Adli, and exhibited great personal courage
at the battle of Panipat fought in 964 A.H. between him and Akbar He
assumed the title of Rajah Bikrammadit at Deli. He ill-treated the
Afghans, who at heart despised him, and who, therefore, for the moat part
threw m ther lot with Akbar, (See Badaoni, Vol II, pp. 18 to 16).

2 See Badaons, Vol I, pp 422 to 428. During the chaos which arose
during the Jatter part of the feeble reign of Muhammad Shah Adli, it was
arranged between Ibrahim aud Sikandar ahas Ahmad Khan, that the former
would rule over the Eastern Empire from Delhi to the easterumost portions
of India, whilst the latter would be master of the Panjab, Multan and other
western tracts

3 According to the Akbarnamah, Badaoni and the Tabaqat-i-Akbari, he
died in 980 A.H. and reigned in Bengal from 971 to 980 A.H., or 1563 to
1572 A.C. He 1s sometimes called Kararani and sometimes Karam and also
Krani. Its related of him that he held every mo:nmg a devotional meeting,
m company with 150 Shiikhs and ’Ulamas, after which he used to trangact
business daring fixed hours, (See Bloch, Tr, Ain, p 171, and Badaont, Vol. Ls

nor of the Siibah of Behar, which he continued to hold in tho
reign of Salim Shah. When Salim Shah passed to the regions
of eternity, in Hindustan, tribal chiefs established themselves,
and in every head the ambition of sovereignty, and in every
heart the aspiration of suzeramty, arose. Sulaiman Khan, after
the death of his brother, Taj Khan, established himself with full
independence as king of Bengal and Behar, and abandoning the
City of Gaiir, owing td the inclemency of its climate, established
himself in the town of Tandah! Andin the year 975 AT, he
conquered the country of Orissa, and placing 1t under a permanent
Governor with a large army, he himself set out fo: the conquest
of the conntry of Kuch Behar He subjugated its environs and
outlying parts, and whilst he was besiegmg its capital, he got
news that the insurgents in Orissa had again raised the standard
of insurrection. Thus, of necessity, he abandoned the siege of
Kuch Behar town,2*and returned to Tandah, which was his
Capital. And for some time, in a similar manner, thore was
commotion all over Hindustan. And when Emperor Humayun
returned to Hindustan from Persia, Sulaiman Khan, excrasng
foresight, sent a letter embodying sentiments of loyalty and

His princips! nobleman and officer, Khin Jahan Lodi, held a conference with
Akbau’s general, Munim Khin-i-Khinan, in the neighbourhood of Patna, and
it was arranged to recite the Kht,ba and strike coms in Bengal after Akbar’s
mame (see p, 427, Bloch Tran., Ain, and Badaom, p 174) In 972 AH,
Sulaiman removed his capital from Gair to Tanduh Akbar sent an embassy
to him (Badaoni, p. 76, Vol. IL).

1 Pandah was on the west side of the Ganges, nearly opposite to Gair.

In 972 A.H. (1564 A.C ) Sulaimiin Kararani, the Afghun king of Bengal,

abandoned Gaiir on account of its bad climate, and shifted the capital westwaid
to Tandah, which was also called Khwaspir Tandah. In 9834,H (1575 AC.)
,Munim Khin-i-Khanin, Akbar’s Supasalar, re-ocoupied Gaiir, where a pesialence
goon broke out, and he as well as many Mughal officers and soldiers died
(See Badaoyy, pp 216 and 217, Vol 11), About 1242 A.H. (1826 A,C.) Tanda):

§ Taking advantage of the dissensions between the Afghans under Sher
Shih and the Mughals onder Emperor Humiyun, Kuch Behar which had
previously been subdued by Alan-d-din Hnsam Shih, king of Bengal, and
partially re-conquered by Sulaimin Karszani rose into semi-independence in
944.A.H wander Bisa, and became independent under Rajas Nara Narayan

friendship, together with presents. Fromthe other side also,
owing to the exigencies of the times which called for the destruc-
tion and extirpation of the descendants and adherents of Sher
Shah, the presents and gifts were accepted, and a condescending
reply containing expressions of reassurance and good-will was
sent, together with » Royal manifesto, ratifying Sulaiman's
continuance in his office. After this, though Sulaiman Khan
continued the Khugéa and the coin after his own name in the
kingdom of Bengal,! he styled himself Hazrat ‘Ala (the Supreme
Chief), and outwardly showing submission to Jallalu-d-din Muham-
mad Akbar Bidshih, he sent occasionally presents and gifts.
Nearly sixteen years* ruling independently over Bengal, in the
year 981 A.H. he died. And he was very energetic, industrious,
and strict. In the history of Firishta, the reign of Taj Khan
is not given, and the reign of Sulaiman Khin is described as
lasting 25 years. Since the brothers, from the beginning, held
conjointly the rule of this country, and Taj Khan came afterwards,
therefore the rule of both has been ascribed to one. God knows
the truth !

REIGN OF BAYAZID KHAN,8 SON OF SULAIMAN KHAN,

After Sulaimén’s death, his son Bayazid Khan, assuming the
sovereignty, ascended the throne of Bengal. As yet more than a
month had not elapsed, and according to another account, one
year aud six months he had ruled, when an Afghin named Hanso,

L From note ante, it would appear that he ceased to do so in Akbar’s
time,

% B.om note ante, it would appear that he ruled only for ten years over
Bengal, whilst he held Behar from the time of Sher Shieh.

Sawanih Akbari regarding the death of Sulaiman, accession and assassination
of his son Bayazid, and the installation of Bayazid’s brother Daud, chiefly

become Administrator of the affairs of the kingdom! Lodi Khan
who was a principal and trusty officer of Sulaiman Khan, demur-
ving, tried to kill him According to a tradition, after 23 days,
the younger brother, named Daud Khin, killed Hanso, to avenge
the death of his biother Exther way, after Bayazid, his brother,
Daud Khan, succeeded to the throne.

——Q———

REIGN OF DAUD KHAN, SON OF SULAIMAN KHAN.

When Daud Khan* ascended the throne of Bengal, sub-
duing completely all parts of Bengal, he introduced the Khutha
and the coin after his own name Owing to continual indulgence
in wine and association with low and mean people, and becanse
of numerous troops and retinue, and plethora of equipage, and
abundance of effects and riches, and greatness of rank and dignity
(in that he had 40,000 well-mounted cavalry, and 3,300 elephants,
and 140,000 infantry, consisting of musketeers, matchlockmen and
rocketeers and archers, and 20,0C0 pieces of ordnance, most of
which were battering guns, and many armed cruisers, and other

his youthful folly read the Hhiuéva in his own name, neglected all forms of
courtesy, and also 1]-treated the chief nobles of his father who consequently
hated him, Hanso, the son of his uncle Imad (brother of Sulaiman), who
wag also his brother in-law, then killed him. Lodi Khan then killed Hanso,
installed Daud (See J.A 8 for 1876, pp. 804-805),

§ Daud Khin became king of Bengal, Behar and Orissa in 980 A.H.
(1572 A.0.) and reigned from 980 A.H. to 984 A H. (1572 to 1576 A.C.), under
the title of Abul Mnzaffer Daud Shah, In 982 A H. Akbar personally wrested
Behar from him by storming Patna and Hajipur forts, and Dind fled to Orissa,
where the battle of Maghuimari or Tukaroi north of Jalisar, was fought in
1675 A.C. betweon him and the Imperialists, commanded by Munim Khan-i-
Khanin. Dind was defeated, aud concluded the Pesce of Katak, under
which Bengal and Behar were ceded by him to Akbar, the latter recognising
Diud’s sovereignty over Orissa In 983 A BH. Munim Khan-1-Khanan died
of malaria at Gair, with alarge part of his army, and Daud Khan, encouraged
by tls civoumstance, invaded Bengal, and on 16th Rabi IL 948 A.H. (12th
July, 1576 A.C). was defeated by Akba,’s General, Husam Quli Khan Jahan,
at Akmahal or Rajmahal, captured and beheaded. (See Vamkh-i-Dandi,

implements of war, which he had ready and in store) he became
haughty, and aiming at conquests caused troubles to the frontiers
of the Empire of Emperor Akbar. Although the well-wishers dis-
suaded him from this policy, and gave him good counsel, he did not
listen. And Munim Khan,! styled the Khan-i-Khanan, who was
Akbar’s Governor of Jaunpur, and held a mangab of Panjhazari,
under the order of the Emperor, turned towards the destruction
and extirpation of Daud Khan, and sent in advance of himself a
small body of Mughal officers, Daud Khan, on hearing of this,
appointed Lodi Khan Afghin, who was his premier grandee, to
oppose the Mughals. At Patna, both the armies encountered
each other, and for some time were engaged in skirmishes. Ab
length, both the factions patched up terms, and both the armies
withdrew to their respective Provinces. But Emperor Akbar,
declining to ratify the treaty, appointed Raja Todar Mal * (after

L He was appointed to his jagira in Jaunpur in the 12th year of Akbar’s
reign, when he concluded peace with Sulaimin Kararani, king of Bengal, who
promised to read the Kiwfoa and strike coins in Akbar’s name. Munim in
982 A.H. was appointed Governor of Behar, (after Akbar captured Hajipur
and Paina from Daud) and ordered to follow Daud into Bengal. Munim
moved to Tandah, opposite to Gaur, on the right side of the Ganges, to settle
political matters, and left the pursuit to Muhammad Quli Khan Barlas. The
latter followed Daud to Satgaon, whence however, Déud withdrew to Orissa,
and Muhammad Quli Khin Barlas from Satgaon invaded thé district of Jasar
(Jessore), where Sarmadi, a friend of Daud, had rebelled, but the Imperialists,
here too mat with no success, and returned to Satzaon. Muhammad Quli
soon after died at Midnipur, and Munim Khan with Today Mal invaded Orissa,
defeated Diud at the battle of Mughulmari or Tikaroi, when the Peace of
Katak was concluded, under which Bengal and Behar were ceded by Daud
to Akbar. Munim died of malaria at Giirin 985 AH The great bridge of
Jaunpur was built by him. It may algo be of interest to note that another
general, named Murad Khin, under Munim Khin-i-Khanin, about 982 A.H.
invaded Fathabad (or Fardpur), and conquered it as well as Sarker Bogla,
This Murad Khin died at Pathabad (Faridpnr) in 988 A.H., and Mukund,
the zamindar of Fathabad and Bhosna, invited Marad’s sons to 4 feast ang

raising him to the rank of Hazari) to the office of Administrator
of Bengal, and sent him in advance of the Khan-i-Khanan, and
detached other officers and soldiers under the command of the
aforesaid Khan for chastising Daud Khan, and repeated his order
to the’ Khan-i-Khanan in regard to the conquest of Behar. Since
at that time, between Daud Khan and Lodi Khan, some estrange-
ment had arisen, Lodi Mhan, being displeased, opened with the
Khan-i-Khanan communications of conciliation, and avowed to-
wards Emperor Akbar sentiments of submission and loyalty.
Another Afghan officer, named Qutlu Khan, who bore a grudge
against Lodi Khan, shaking the chain of enmity, denounced
Lodi Khan before Daud Khin, stating that Lodi Khan had been
in collusion with Akbar’s grandees, and that covertly he was of
one mind with the latter. Daud Khan, on being apprised of this,
writing @ soothing letter to Lodi Khan, and bringing him over to
his side, had him in his presence, and churlishly slew Lodi Khan,
who was renowned for his soundness of views, sagacity, bravery
and valour. Daud Khan then himself with a large army
marched towards the bank of the river Sone, to encounter Akbar’s
army. Andat the point of the confluence of the rivers Sone,
Sro and the Ganges, a great naval engagement took place.

The young gnd the old were tired out with the battle,

Owing to incessant shower of spears and arrows.

The hartle of daggers rose to the skies,

Hearts were pierced, and a torrent of blood set a-flowing in
the river.

The battle-axe became inlaid on the helmets of the heroes.

Like the comb of fighting cocks on the head.

At length, the fortune of Akbar triumphed, and the Afghins
being routed, took to flight, and retired to Patna. Some of
their war-vessels fell into the hands of the Mughals. The
Khan-i-Khanfin also following up and crossing the river, marched
with the greatest expedition to Patna, and investing that fort,

When the signal to assault the fort was given,

From both sides a hundred guns and muskets roared.

From the booming of the thundering guns, and their
smoke,

Like unto the sable cloud wherein the thundering angel
dwells,

From the shower of cannon-balls, like the hau,

Sushed in amidst those armies a deluge of destruction.

of Patna was impossible. Therefore, mustering up Imperial
courage, he with all his princes and nobles set out in one thousand .

the suburbs of Patna, he got news that‘Aesh Khan Neazi, who
‘was one of the faithful officers of Daud Khan, sallying out of the
fort, had been killed whilst fighting with the Khan-i-Khinan,
and that the garrison of the fort were contemplating flight. The
Emperor then detached Khan ‘Alim! with a corps of 3,000 cavalry
for storming the fort of Hajipur; and the latter arriving there,
wrested the fort from Fath Khan, aud reduced it to his own
possession. Daud Khan, on hearing of the fall of the fort of
Hajipur, deputed sagacious envoys to the Emperor Akbar,
asking forgiveness for his misconduct. The Emperor replied
that on his personal attendance, his crimes would be forgiven;
and in the event of his non-attendance, he might choose one out
of the following three alternatives: ‘“ (1) either he might engage
singly in a combat with me, (2) or he might send one of his
grandees to fight singly with one of my grandees, (3) or he might
send one of his war-elephants to fight singly with one of my
elephants; whoever is triumphant in either, the country shall be ,
his.” Daud Khan, on receiving this message, we frightened,
and seeing no advantage in tarrying at Patna, 96 night-fall slipped

conferred on him the title of Khan ‘Alim. ‘ When Akbar moved against Dind
Shah in Patna, Khin ‘Alim commanded a corps, and passing up the river on
boats towards the month of the Gandak, effected a landing.” (See Blochmann’s

out through:the iron-gate,’ and getting into a boat, and leaving
behind effects and equipage,' fled towards Bengal. The forts of
Hajipur and Patna were seized by the Imperialists, and the
Emperor Akbar pursued the vanquished Afghan army to a dis-
tance of 25 kro, and 400 war-elephants of Daud Khan, together with
other equipages, fell ‘into the hands of the Mughal heroes. Who-
ever (amongst the vanquished) fled, saved his life, the rest were
put-to the sword. The Emperor, leaving Munim Khan to
subjugate the. ontlying provinces and to extirpate Daud Khin,
retired from Dariapur.| When the Khan-i-Khanin reached
Sakrigali, Daud Khan becoming helpless fled to Orissa. And some
of the grandees of Akbar, ike Rajah Todar Mal and others, who
had-taken the route* to Orissa in pursuit of him, were twice
vanquished by Junaid Khan, son of Daud Khin, Munim Khan,
hearing of this, himself’ marched to Orissa. Daud Khan ad-
yanced to encounter the latter; when both the forces approached
each other, they fell into battle-array.*

advanced from Patna on boats in pursuit of Dind Shih, the king of Bengal.

The heroes arrayed themselves on the battle-field,

All were armed with daggers, arrows and spears.

On two sides the two armies sprang up like mountains,

One without terror, the other with terror.

All vied with each other,

And charged, and themselves were charged with guns,
arrows and spears. ’

From the blood of the heroes of both the armies,

Flowed a torrent on that battle-field.

On the field fell many a slaughtered,

On both sides, towered heaps of corpses.

An Afghan narhed Gujra,! who in heroism and valour was the
Rustam of his time, and who commanded the van of Daud Khin’s
army, made a bold onslaught on the commander of the Khan-i-
Khanan’s van, named Khin-i-‘Alim, discomfited the Imperial
vanguard, slew Khan ‘Alim, and shook the van, And a number
of Imperialists who were between the centre and the van,
becoming discomfited by the attack of Dand Khan, reeled back to
the centre, and caused confosion. The Khan-i-Khanan, with the
small remnant of troops that yet held the ground, advanced in
front of Gujra, and by chance, Gujra and the Khan-i-Khinan
encountered each other.

When the two heroes encountered each other,
They unsheathed from both sides dazzling swords.
Now one, and then the other, inflicted sword-cuts,
Worthy of heroes.

The one did not succeed in penetrating the cuirass,
The other defended himself with a shield.

At length, by the sword of Gujra,

The body of the Khan-i-Khinan got wounded.
Other adherents came in the midst,

And intervened between the two combatants.

and that there is a family there that claims Gujra Khin as its ancestor.

When Gujra a second time came to fight,

From the aim of destiny, the bow became stretched,
When the arrow Int him clean on the forehead,
The arrow passsd right through the head.

Gujra fell on the field like a mountain,

By his fall, his army became dispirited,

When fortune turned its face from Daud Khan,
From every side, misfortune hemmed him in.

Daud Khan fled from the battle,

As he no longer dreamt of victory.

Daud Khan, leaving behind the war-elephants and other
armaments, in despair fled from the battle-field. And Rajah
Todar Mal and other Imperial grandees marched in pursuit! of
Daind Khan. When Dand Khan reached the environs of the
river Chin,’ he took refuge in the fort of Katak. Since every
avenue of escape was closed, he was obliged to place his family
and children inside the Fort, and then himself advanced to fight,
putting the coffin on the shoulder, and preparing to die. Rajah
Todar Mal communicated to the Khan Khanan the state of
affairs. Although wounded, the Khin Khanan on the wings of
swiftness proceeded to that place. But Daud Khan negociated
terms of peace through the mediation of one of the Omra, and

1 It appears fram the Akbarnamah that after the battle of Takroi, Todar
Mal pursued Daud Khin up to Bhadrak, whilst Mun‘im Khin the Khan-i-
Khanin owing-te-his wounds still lay behind. At this time Dand Khan collect-
ed ins troops at Katek, and so Todar Mal wrote to Mun‘im Khan to come up,
and Man‘im Khin in spite of his wounds, moved up with the whole Imperial
army to Katak, when the Peace of Katak was concluded. Under it, Daud
Khin formally resigned the sovere gniy of Behar and Bengal to Akbar, retain-
ing only Oriese. The battle of Takroi (8rd March, 1 575 A 0.)—called by
Badaoni ‘Bichwi-—was a moat decimve battle, as it'virtually ended Afghan
supremacy in Bengal and Behar, and substituted Mughal rule in its place.

Soon after, owing to the badness of its climate, he fell ill, and

saulted the centre of Daud Khan, and a great battle commenced.

On that baitle-field,? mutual fightings occurred :
Both the armies lost numbers of men.

From the numbers of the killed, mounds were raised,
And signs of the Day of Resurrection appeared.

Imperial throne, inasmuch as from official despatches, news-letters,
and the correspondence of officers, news of the insurrection of

Singh to the Nizimat of the Sabah of Bengal, whilst Wazir Khan
was exalted to the office of Diwan and Auditor é his Province.!
After their arrival in this country, the refractory ‘( man advanced
to fight, and a battle ensued. ‘Ogman with great shrewdness opened
secret negotiations. As the war was protracted, and the extirpa-
tion of the Afghans was not accomplished, in that very year
of accession, Rajah Man Sing * was recalled from office, and

of Afghan opposition was broken, in the tame of Emperor Jahangur,

Government by the Mughal Emperors, who appointed two distinct func-

other, the Diwan (in charge of Revenue and Finance). This system of
Government, though actually enforced in Bengal m Jahangir’sa time, must

raised to the rank of a Panjhaza7, with 5,000 soldiers and troopers ;
and 2 lacs of rupees ‘was given him for his allowance, and 3 lacs of
yupees was given for the expensés of Ins contmgent. After
taking leave of the Emperor, he arrived in Bengal. As yet some
months had noé passed, when he was killed at the hands of ‘Ali
Quli Beg Astajli, styled Sher Afghan Khan? And the detail of

particulars of lus career in Bloch Tr of Ain, Vol. I, p. 340, and also in

1 Hisname was Shaikh Khuba [Qntbu-d-din Khin-i-Chishti] and his father
was Shaikh Zada of Badaon, and his mother a daugher of Shaikh Salim of Fath-
pur Sikri He was a foster-brother of Jahangir, who whilst a Prince conferred
upon Khuba the title of Qutbu-d-tin Khan, and made him Sibadar of Behar.
On Jahingi’s accession,to the throne, Khuba wasappointed Sibader of Bengal,
(1015 A.H.) At that time Shor Afghan ‘Ali Quli Istajli was tuyuldar (or
jagirdar) of Bardwan, and Ins wife Mehrunnissa (afterwards Empress Nir
Jahin) was coveted by Emperor Jahangir Qutbu-d-din had instructions to
send Sher Afghan to court, but the latter refusing to go, Qutb went to
Bardwan, where Sher Afghan came to meet him. On his approach, Qutbt
hfted up his horse-whip Sher Afghan thereon rushed with his sword agaist
Qutb, and inflicled a cut on Ins abdomen Qutb died, and one of Ins followers
Ambah Khan, gave Sher Afghan a sword-cut on the head, when the latter was
also killed. (Bloch Tr.,Am, Vol. I, p 496 and Igbalnamah-t Jahangtrt, p 19).

3 He was safarch: or butler of Ismail II, king of Persia After the latter's
death, he went to India, and met ab Multan, Abdur Rahim Khin-i-Khanin,
and received a mangab, and on arrival at court, Akbar gave him in marriage to
Mebronnissa (the future Nir Jahin), daughter of Mirza Ghiyis Tehrani.
Prince Salim fell in love with her, and brought about, on his accession to the
throne, Sher Afghan’s death. Sher Afghan had received Bardwan district as
twyul or gagi?, on Jahingir’s accession. His body was buried in the shrine ‘of
the samt Bahram Saqqa at Bardwan. (See Igbalnamah, p 22).

p. 186), tolet her shoot them She killed two with one bullet, and the other

this incident is this, ‘Ali Quli Beg Astajli was a butler of
Shah Isma‘4l,! son of Shah Tahmasp Safavi! On the death of
Shah Isma‘il, coming to India vid Qandahar, at Multan he entered
the service of ‘Abdur Rahim Khan, Khan Khanan,? who was
then employed on the conquest of Vhatah and Sindh. The Khan
Khanin informally enlisted him in the ranks of Imperial officers, and
in that expedition, ‘Ali Quti shewed bravery and rendered valuable
services. When the Khan Khanan from that expedition returned
triumphant to the Imperial presence, at his request, ‘Ali Quli was"
hononred with an appropriate Mansab, and atthe same time, a
daughter of Mirza Ghiyig Beg Tehrani,’ named Mehrunnisa,* was
wedded to him. Andatthe time when Emperor Akbar proceeded
from Akbarabad (Agra) to the conquest of the Dakhin, and the
Orown-Prince (Prince Salim, afterwards Emperor Jahangir), was
ordered to undertake the subjugation of the Rana of Udaipur, ‘Ali
Quili Beg was appointed as an auxiliary to the Prince. The Prince,

two with two bullets, and go one of the courtiers spoke out on the spur af the
moment the verse given in the text. See Bloch. Tr, Ain, Vol. I, p. 524,

1 These were kings of Persia. See p 97, Namath-Khusruay.

3 He was & sepahsalar or Commander-in-Chief under Akbar. His great
military services were conquests of Smdh and Gujrat He was also an ac-
complished scholar, and translated into Persian Memoirs of Babar. See
Bloch. Tr., Ain, Vol. I, p. 384 and Igbalnamah-i-Jahangirs, p. 287,

8 His real name was Mirza Ghiyiisu-d-din Muhammad, and his father was
Khwajéh Muhammad Sharif, who was Vazer to Tatir Sultin and hie son
Qazaq Khin, and who was subsequently appointed, by Shih Tahmasp, Vazir
of Yazd, After his father’s death, Ghiyds Beg fléd from Persia with two
sons and one daughter. On the way at Qandahar, his wife gave birth to a
daughter, named Mehrunnmssa—the futnre world-renowned Nir Jahan,
eongoré of Emperor Jahangir On his arrival at Fathpor Sikri, Akbar
appointed him Diwan of Kabul, and subsequently Diwin-i-Bayitat, In
Jabingir’s reign, he recerved the title of Itimadu-d-danlah. After the death
of her first husband, Sher Afghan, at Bardwan in the fight with Qutbu-d-din
Khan, Jahangir’s Governor of Bengal, Mehrunniasa was bronght to court,
and married in 1020 A H. by Jahangir, who bestowed on her first the title of
Nir Mahal and then that of Nir Jahn, her father Ghiyas Beg being at the
same time advanced to the office of Prime Mimster or Vakil-i-Kal. See

and 55.

shewing every attention to bim, gave him the title of Sher Afghan,
and qn accession to the throne, bestowing onhim a Jagir at Bardwan
in the Sibah of Bengal, he sent him there. Afterwards, when the
crookedness of his conduct, his wickedness and ill-temper
became known to the Emperor, the latter, whilst sending Qutb
Khan to Bengal, gave the latter a hint that if he found Sher
Afghan well-behaved and loyal, well aud good, but if otherwise,
he should send him tothe Imperial presence, and that in coming
if he made excuses, he should punish him. When Qutbt-d-din
Khan reached Bengal, he was dissatisfied with Sher Afghan’s
action and conduct. Although he summoned the latter to his
presence, putting forward idle excuses, he did not attend Qutbn-
d-din Khan communicated the matter to the Emperor, who
ordered that agreeably to the injunctions conveyed at the time
of his departure, he should punish Sher Afghan. The above
Khan, on receipt of the Imperial order, instantly marched
swiftly to Bardwan. Sher Afghan on getting news of the
arrival of the above Khan, advanced forward with two grooms
to receive him. At the time of meeting, the soldiers of
Qutbu-d-din Khan crowding in stood at a distance, like a ring.
Sher Afghan said: “ What is this treatment, and what does
it mean?” The Khan told his soldiers to disperse, moved
alone in Sher Afghan’s company, and commenced conversation.
Sher Afghan read signs of treachery in the aspect of affairs, and
forestalling the other, he thought it prudent to apply the remedy
before the disease appeared, and with great agility hit Qutbu-
d-din on the abdomen with a sword, so that the latter’s entrails
came out, The Khan! seizing his abdomen with both hands,
shouted out: ‘ Don’t spare him, don’t let this wretch escape.”
A Kashmirian, named Aina Khan,* who was one of Qutb’s
principal officers, spurrmg his horse, struck Sher Afghan with a
sword on the head. In that plight, Sher Afghan with another blow
fimshed Aina Khau’s work. At this moment, the soldiers of Qutbu-
d-din Khan collecting from all sides, killed Sher Afghan also,
by inflicting successive cuts Sher Afghan Khan is that person,

this moment,

THE NIZAMAT OF JAHANGIR QULI KHAN’

Towards the end of the year 1015 A.H , which was the second
year of Emperor Jahangir’s accession, Jahangir Quli Khan, who was
Governor of the Subah of Behar, was appomted to be Governor of
Bengal. And his name was Lialah Beg, and he was a slave-boy

1 What chivalry towards women was possible under Islim in olden
days even in India, is eloquently testafied to by the career of Nir Jahin,
the renowned Empress. Emperor Jahangir, her Royal Consort, used to
say of her, “Before I married her, I never knew what marriage meant,
I have conferred the duties of Government on her; I shall be satisfied if I
have a seer of wine and half a seer of meat per diem.” With the exception
of the Khutba, she received all the privileges of royalty. She set by
the side of her Consort m administering State affairs, and her name appears
side by side with that of Emperor Jahangir on the Imperial farmans and coins,
She took particular care of orphan girls, led the fashions of the tames, and dis-
played sesthetic art in adorning apartments and arranging feasts. She was
also a poetess. She exhibited great resourcefulness and bravery in rescamg
Jahangir from Mahabet Khin’s hands She hes buned at Lahore near
her husband. On Jahangir’s coins, the following inscription was engraved.

Emperor Akbar, who bestowed him on Prince Niru-d.din Muham-
mad Jabangir, He wasastrong-buili man, and he had rendered
useful services In religious matters and in regard for justice,
he was very firm. After reaching Bengal, as yet he had not fully
set his hand to the work of administration, when death claimed
him. His rule lasted one month and some days. When news of
his death reached the Emperor, Islam Kh&n,! son of Shaikh Badru-
d-din Fatehpuri, who held the office of Governor of Behar, was
appointed Governor of Bengal. And the Governorship of Subah
Behar and Patna was conferred on Afzal Khin,? son of Shaikh Abul

RULE OF NAWAB ISLAM KHAN, AND AN ACCOUNT
OF THE FALL OF ‘OSMAN KHAN.

When in the third year of Emperor Jahangir’s accession, the
Nizadmat of the Siibah of Bengal was entrusted to Islim Khan, the
latter had strict orders to extinguish the fire of msurrection and
rebellion that had been kindled by ‘ Osman Khan. Islam Khan on

Akbar’s renowned Prime Minister Islim Khin died as Governor of Bengalin
1022 A.H. (Tuzuk, p. 126). His name was Shaikh Alau-d-din Ohishti, and he
was a grandson of Shaikh Salim, the Saint of Fathpir Sikm. He received
the title of Islim Khin, and was Governor of Bengal from 1016 to
1022 AH. He shifted in 1015 A H., the Mughal Viceregal Capital of Bengal
from Tandah to Dacca. See Igbalnamah-r-Jahangiri, p. 33 and Maasi-ul-
Umara.

® Shakh Abul Faz] Aliami, Akbar’s friend and Prime Mmister, was born
on 14th Jannary, 1551 4 0., (6th Muharram, 958 A H) at Agrah, during the
reign of Islim Shah. He wasa son of Shaikh Mubarik; held the office of Prime
Minister under Akbar and actively co-operated with the latter in the enuncia-
tion of a liberal policy of toleration in the government of the mixed races
subject to the Musalman Rule in India He was a great scholar, and author
of several works including the Akbarnamah and the Ain-i-Akbari He was
murdered by Bir Smgh, at the instigation of Prmce Salim (afterwards
Emperor Jahangir) on 12th August, 1602 A.O. See lus life in Blochmann’s

of the administration of the country. When his good administra.
tion and his thorough grasp of the affairs of the Nizémat came to be
known by the Emperor, the latter, in recognition of his good
services, in the 4th year of accession, raised him to the rank of a
Panjhazari, including soldiers and troopers. Islam Khan detach-

Tandah to Dacca or Jahangirnagar (so called after Emperor Jahangir) by
~ Jahangir’s Viceroy of Bengal, named Islim Khin. Dacca continued to remain
henceforth the Mughal Viceregal Capital of Bengal for nearly a century
(barring a few years when it was temporarily shifted to Rajmahal).

Rustam-i-Zaman.” In the printed Pers text, y is inserted by mustake be-
tween “ Shaikh Kabir” and “ Shujait.Khin,” thus misleading the reader to
fancy that these were two individuals. See note post He was a relation of
Islim Khin-i-Qhishti, Governor of Bengal, and received first the title of
Shujait Khin’ from Prince Salim, who on ascending the throne, gave him
the additional title of “ Rustim-i-Zaman,” on account of his services in putting
down the Afghans under ‘Osmin in Bengal See p. 64, Iqbalnamah Jahangir

commander of 1,000 foot, 800 horse, and reccived the title of Kishwar Khin
from the Emperor Jahangir. He was for some tame Governor of Rohtas,
and served in Bengal in 1021 A.H., under Shujait Khin (Shaikh Kabir

pointed his auxiliaries. When these reached the frontiers of the
tract® under ‘Osman, they first deputed a sagacions envoy to con-
ciliate the refractory mind of the leader of the insurrection. They
strung the precious pearl of good advice to the ear-corner of his
heart Inasmuch as that wretched man (‘Osman Khan) was by
inherent nature a bad stuff, and had not the capacity of appreciat-
ing goodness, not appraising the value of this pearl of advice, he
collected brickbats of vain aspirations in the vessel of his bad
luck, and in the face of that shining pearl. he put forward the
stature of his wild ambition, gave permission to the envoy to
withdraw without accomphshing his mission, and preparing to dies
spurred swiftly the horse of aggressiveness and fighting, and

in 1027 A.H. was Governor of Behar (See Bloch. Tr , Ain, Vol. I, pp. 521

tract including the Sundarbans, the lands alongside the Brahmaputra and
the Megna, in fact, the whole tract from Ghoraghat (or Rangpur)
southward to the sea, His residence is mentioned m the histories

“ Vilayet-i-Dacca,” but his father "Isa Khin’s residence (ude p, 848 of do) is
mentioned to have been at Baktarapur, close to Khizrpur. Khisrpur has been
identified with a place about s mile north of modern Narainganj, close to

seventh year of accession, towards the end of the month of Zilhaj,
1020 A.TL., the latter ari ayed their forces, and advanced to the field

They fell to fighting against each other from every side.

to hell! On seeing that some of the leadera of the Imperialists
had been killed, and their ranks emptied of veterans, a second time
‘Osman placing before himself the rogue elephant, named Bacha,
himself mounted on a saddled elephant, personally assaulted the
Imperial van, and delivered snccessive onsets. From the side
of the Imperialists, Shujéit Khan,’ with hie relations and brothers,
advancing to oppose him, exhibited great bravery and heroism.
Many of Ins relations were killed, and many retreated on receiv-
ing mortal wounds. When that elephant came in front of
Shujait Khan, the latter spurring his horse struck it with a spear
on tts trunk, and with great agility drawing the sword from his
waist, inflicted two successive cuts on its head ; and when he came
in collision with the elephant, he drew his dagger, and inflicted
on it two more cuts. The elephant, fiom its great ferocity, not
recking of these cuts, with great fury rushed up, and flung down
both the rider and the horse. Shewmg agility, Shujait dismonnted
from his horse, and stond erect on the ground. A+ this juncture,
Shujait’s groom struck the trunk of the elephant with a donble-
edged sword, and inflicted a serious cut, causing the elephant to
fall on its knees. Shujiit Khan, with the help of his groom,
threw down the rider of the elephant, and with a dagger inflicted
another cut on its trunk. The elephant roaring fiercely fled after
this cut, and moving some paces fell down. Shuja‘it Khin’s horse
sprang up unhurt, and the Khan mounted it again, In the mean-
time, another elephant attacking the Imperial standard-bearer
threw him down with the standard.

and pursued ‘Osmin. See also Iqhalnamah, pp. 61 te 64.

‘Osman were fighting for their homes and hearths, and did not deserve this

Shnjait Khan shouted out, “Take care, behave hke a man, IT am
alive, and will soon advance to your rescue.” A number of troops
‘who were round the standard-bearer took courage, inflicted
serious cuts on the elephant which fled, and placed the standard-
bearer on the horse again. At this time, when the batile was
lingering towards its close, and many had fallen, and many being
wounded were unable to move their limbs, the Imperial fortune
blazed forth, and a cannon-ball hit ‘Osman Khan on the forehead,
and levelled him straight on his horse Though he realised that
he could not survive this wound, still he heroically encouraged his
soldiers to fight on And when heread signs of defeat in the fore-
head of his fate, pulling back the rem of his adversity, with the last
breathings of a dying man, he reached Bengal. And the triumph-
ant Imperialists following him up to his camp, halted. ‘Ogman!
expired at midmght. Wali Khan, his brother, and Mamriz
Khan, his son, leaving behind the tents and the armaments,
and removing his vorpse, fled to their tent. Shujait Khan on
hearing of this, thought of following up the enemy, but his ad-
visers opposed the pursuit that day, on the ground that the
troops were tired, the killed had to be buried, and the wounded
dressed. In the meantime, Mu‘taqad Khan, who was afterwards
honoured with the title of Lashkar Khan, ‘Abdus-Salim Khan, son
of ‘Abdul Mu‘azzam Khin,? and other officers of the Emperor
arrived with a fresh re-inforcement of 300 cavalry and 400 mus-

1 Khwajah ‘Osman, according to the Makhzan-i-Afghani, was the second
son of Miyan *Isa Khin Lohani, who after the death of Qutb Khan was the
leader of the Afghans in Orissa and South Bengal. ‘Osman succeeded his
brother Sulaiman, who had ‘reigned’ for some time, had killed in a fight
Himat Singh, son of Ruyah Nin Smgh, and had held lands near the Brahma-
putra, and subdued the Rajahs of the adjacent countries. ‘Osman succeeded
him, and received from Min Singh lands in Omasa and Satgaon and later
in Eastern Bengal, with a revenue of § or 6 lacs per year. His readence is
described to have been at “Kohistin Dacca,” the “ Vildéyet-i-Dacca” aud
Dacca itself The battle between ‘Ogmin and the Imperialist General, Shujiit,
took place at a distance éf 100 kos from Dacéa.on 9th Muharram, 1021 (01 2nd
March, 1612 4.0.) Stewart places the battle on the banks of the Subarnarika
in Orisea, which is improbable. ‘Osmin’s brother, Wali, on submission, received
a tile with a jagir, and was made a commander of ona thousand. According
to the Maasir he was murdered. See Bloch. Tr., Ain, Vol I, p. 520, Makhzan-

kketeers. Shujait Khan taking this corps with him, chased the
enemy. Wah Khan despairing sent the following message: “The
root of this insurrection was ‘Ogmin; he has met with his deserts,
we are all loyal. If we receive assurance of safety, we would
make our submission and would send the elephants of ‘Osman,
in the shape of tribute.” Shujait Khan and Mu‘taqad Khan,
shewing chivalry, arranged terms of peace The following day,
Wali Khin and Mamriz Khan, with all their brothers and
connexions, came to meet Shujait Khan, and presented forty-
nine elephants as tribute. Shujait and Mu‘taqad Khan, taking
charge of them, moved 'tictorious and triumphant to Islam Khan
to Jahangirnagar (Dacca). Islam Khan sent a despatch contain-
ing news of the victory to the Hmperor at Akbaribad (Agra).
On the 16th of the month of Muharram 1021 AH, thus despatch
reached the Emperor, and was perused. In recognition of this
good service, Islim Khin was raised to the mansab of a
Shashhaziri, and Shujéit Khin had his mansab raised, and
received the tatle of Rustam-i-Zamin; whilst all other Im-
perialists who had loyally and gallantly co-operated in the
extirpation of ‘Osman Khan, received similarly befitting mansabs.
The insurrection of ‘Ogman Khin lasted eight years, and in
the 7th year of the Emperor's accession, corresponding to
1022 A.H., his subjugation was accomplished, In the 8th year
of the Hmperor’s accession, Islam Khan led an expedition against
the Mags, who were brutes in human form. Islim Khan sent to
the Emperor, in charge of his son, Hoshang Khan, a number of
the Mags that were captured, and in the same year (1022 A.H.)
Islata Khan died in Bengal. Thereupon, the Governorship of
that country was entrusted to his brother, Qasim Khan.

NIZAMAT OF IBRAHIM KHAN, AND THE ARRIVAL
OF PRINCE SHAH JAHAN IN BENGAL

Ibrahim Khan Fateh Jang,! in the year 1027 A.H., corres-
ponding to the 13th year of the Emperor's accession, received the
Viceroyalty of Bengal and Orissa. He appointed his nephew,
Ahmad Beg Khan?# to be Governor of Orissa, whilst he himself
resided at Jahangirnagar (Dacca), and devoted himself to the
work of administration. As during his incumbency, several grave
affairs came to pass, these will be briefly narrated. In the 17th
year of the Emperor’s accession, corresponding to 1031 A H.,
news reached Emperor Jahangir to the effect that the King of
Persia was aiming to wrest the fort of Qandahar. In conse-
quence thereof, Zainnl-‘Abidin, the Pay-Master General of the
Ahadi* troops, communicated an order to Prince Shah Jahan at
Burhanpur, directing the latter to march quickly to the Inrperial
presence with troops, artillery and elephants. The Prince march-
ing from Burharpur® reached Mando,® sent a message to the

® See Bloch. Tr., Ain, Vol. I, p. 512. He was a son of Muhammad Sharif,
eldest son of Ghiis Beg, father of Empress Nir Jahin.

§ In the 15th year, when the Persians threatened Qandahar, Khin Jahin
‘was appointed by Jahangir Governor of Multan. In the 17th year, Shah
Akbar, king of Persia, took Qandahar, after a afege of forty days. Khan Jahin
was called to court for consultation, and xt was decided that Prmce Khurram
{Shih Jahin) should be placed at the head of the expeditionary force to re-
conguer Qandahar In the meantime, Shih Jahan iebelled, and the expedition
to Qandabar was not undertaken. See Bloch Tr, Ain, Vol I, pp. 508-504.

non-Regnlars and Auxlianes. They were created under Akbar. See Bloch.

Emperor to the effect that ag the rainy season had approached, he
would make Mando his rainy-season quarter, and would afterwards
wait on the Emperor. He also asked for pargannah Dholpur ! being
added to his jagér, and set Daria Khan? Afghan to take charge of it.
But before the arrival of the Prince’s letter, the Emperor had
negotiated the marriage of Prmce Shahryar with a daughter
of Nur Mahal’ by Sher Afghan,* and at Nur Mahal’s request
the aforesaid Pargannah had been bestowed on Shaharyar, and
Sharifu-l-Mulk, servant of Prince Shaharyar, had taken possession
vf the fort of Dholpur. Svon after, Darié Khan arrived and
wanted to forcibly take possession of the fort. From both sides,
the fire of conflict kindled. As luck would have it, an arrow hit
Sharifu-l-Mulk on the eye, and blinded him. This mishap
caused the Begam to be indignant; the fire of discord blazed up,
and at the instance of the Begam, the expedition to Qandahar
was entrusted to Prince Shaharyar, whilst Mirza Rustam ® Safavi
was appointed ‘Ataliq of the Prince and Generalissimo of

daughter named Ladli Begum, to whom Prince Shahryar (fifth son of Jahangir)
was married, Shah Jahan or Prince Khurram was Jahengir’s third son Nir
Jahn had no children by Jahangir.

Shih Tahmasp king of Persia (930-984 AH.), and Governor of Qandahar
under the latter in 965 A.H. Mirza Rustam’s daughter was marred to Prince
Parviz, second son of Jahangir. He invaded Qandahar, but met with no
success. In 1021, Jahangir appomted him Governor of Thatha, and after-
wards Shéshhazar? and Governor of Allahahad, and im the 21st year, Governor
of Behar. He died in 1051 at Agra. His third son Mirza Hasan-1-Safavi was
Governor of Koch under Jahangir and died in 1059 A H., and his grandson (son
of Mirza, Hasan) nemed Mirza Safshekan was Faujdar of Jessore in Bengal.
(Sea Bloch Tr., Ain, Vol. I, pp 314-315 and Maasir-ul-Umara). Mirzanagar,
a place close to Jessore town, probably was Mirza Safghekan’s Fanjdari head-
quarters, and received its name from him He died in 1078 A.H. Mirza,
Safshekan’s son, Mirza Saifu-d-din Safavi, accepted the titular distinction of

his army. On hearing of the blazing of tho fire of discord, Shah
Jahan sent to the Emperor along with a letter Afzal Khan, son of
Abul Fazl ‘Allami, who after his dismissal from the Governorship
of Behar, held the office of Diwan to the Prince, so that with the
aid of cajolery and civility the storm of the dust of discord might
be made to subside, and relations of amity and harmony between
the Emperor and the Prince might not cease. Inasmuch as the
Begam held absolute sway over the mind of the Emperor, Afzal
Khan was refused an audience, and was ordered back with-
out accomplishing his mission. And orders were passed on the
Imperial Revenue-officers directing that the Mahals in the
possession of Shah Jahan, in the Sarkars of Hisar? and Doab,’
should be transferred to Prince Shaharyaér. And injunctions
were issued to Prince Shih Jahan, intimatg that the
Siibabs of the Dakhin, and Gujrat® and Malw&* were bestowed
on him, and that he might rule over them, makmg his head-
quarters within those limits wherever he pleased, and directing
that he should quickly despatch to the Emperor some troops for
the expedition to Qandahar. And in the beginning of the month
of Khurdid, in the 18th year of the Emperor's accession, in the
year 1082 A.H. Asaf Khan,’ was appointed Subahdar of the Pro.
vinces of Bengal and Orissa. Since a daughter of Asaf Khan had
been married to Sh&h Jahan, some malicious persons imputing

to Agaf Khan partiality for Shah Jahan, induced the Begam to
call from Kabul Mahabet Khan, who was an old enemy of Agaf
Khan, and who was also ill-disposed to Shah Jahan. And the
Imperial order with the Begam’s message was sent for sammon-
ing Mahabet Khan. Mahabet Khan on arrival from Kabul, was
honoured with an audience by the Emperor. Order was also
passed to Sharif Khan,! Vakil of Prince Parviz, to hasten to
Court with the Prince and the Behar army. And sineoe the
Begam was anxious, owing to separation from her brother, that
year on the 2nd of the month of Adar, order was given to Asaf
Khan to return to Court. In short, on bemg apprised of the
foregoing incidents of inattention on the part of the Emperor, and
of ill-will on the part of Nir Jahén Begam, Shah Jahan. arranged
that Qazi ‘Abdul ‘Aziz proceeding to court, should represent his
wishes to the Emperor, whilst he himself would follow before the
arrival of Prince Parviz and the armies from different parts of
the Hmpire, so that the dust of discord might possibly be laid.
In short, the aforesaid Qazi met the Imperial army on the banks
of the river* of Ludianah. Inasmuch as the Emperor's mmd was
enamoured of the Begam’s seductions, the Qazi was refused
access to the Emperor, and Mahabet Khan was ordered to im-
prison him. Soon after, Shah Jahan also with a large army
encamped at Fatehpir, in the vicinity of Akbar&bid (Agra).
The Emperor marched back from Sirhind,’ and all the grandees
and officers from different jagirs joined the Emperor, and before
the Caprial, Delhi, was reached, numerous force collected. The
vanguard of the Imperialists was entrusted to the command of
‘Abduliah Khan,* who was ordered to proceed one kroh in advance
of the Imperial camp. But Shih Jahan, foreseeing the result,
thought that if he engaged in fighting against such a numerous
army, the result might prove disastrous. Consequently, together

with the Khén Khan&n ! and other officers, retiring by the right.
side road, he marched 20 kroh northwards. He left, however, Rajah
Bikramayit * and Darab Khan, son of the Khin Khanan, together
with other officers, in front of the Imperialists, so that if the
latter, under the direction of the Begam, led the pursuit, the
aforesaid commanders might prevent their advance, till the
discord subsided On the 20th Jaméadi-al-Awwal 1032 A.H.,
news of Shah Jahan’s withdrawal reached the Emperor. The
Begam, under the advice of Mahabet Khan, detached Asaf Khan
Khwajah .Abul Hasan,’ ‘Abdullah Khan, Lashkar Khan,‘
Fedai Khan and Nawazish Khan,® &., with 25,000 cavalry
te fight. From Shah Jahin’s side, Rajah Bikramajit and Darab
Khan, arraying their forces, advanced, and on both sides the
fighting commenced with arrows and muskets. As ‘Abdullah
Khan? was in intrigue with Shah Jahan, he promised that when
the two forces would encounter each other, availing himself of an
opportunity, he would go over to the Prince’s side. Finding an

rebelled, he sided with the latter. His second son’s name was Darab Khin,
who fell into the hands of Prince Parviz and Mahabet Khin, who killed him,
wrapped. his head in a table-cloth, and sent it as «present of a ‘melon’ to
his father, Mirza Abdur Rahim.

3 His name was Rai Pati Das; he was a Khatri. Akbar conferred ow
him the title of Raja Bikramajit. He served Akbar as joint Diwan of Bengal,
Diwan of Behar, and was made a commander of 5,000, Jahangir on his
accession created him Mir Atash or Superintendent of Artillery. When dis-
turbances broke out in Gujrat, he was sent to Ahmadabad to pacify the
rebels. Seo Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. I, p, 469, Bloch. Tr. and Maaszr-ul-Umara,

opportunity now, he with the grentest expedition joined Shah
Jahan’s army. Rajah Bikramajit who was aware of ‘Abdullah
Khan's plan, with great delight went to Darab Khan, to inform
the latter of ‘Abdullah Khan’s desertion. As luck would have
it, a cannon-ball hit the Rajah on the forehead, and threw him
down. From this mishap, the thread of the arrangement of
Shah Jahan’s army was broken. Although a commander
like ‘Abdullah Khan, destroying the basis of the Imperial van-
guard, had joined the Prince’s army, Darib Khan and other
commanders of Sha Jahan’s army were not daring enough to
hold their ground. On the Imperialists’ side, the desertion of
‘Abdullah Khan, and on the Prince’s side, the fall of Rajah
Bikramajit caused mutual confusion, and both the armies wera
dispirited. Towards the end of the day, both the forces withdrew
to their quarters. At length, the Emperor withdrew from Akbar-
Sbad towards Ajmir, whilst Prince Shih Jahan retired towards
Mando. On the 25th of the Jamadi-al-Awwal, the Emperor
detached Prince Parviz with a large army to follow up Shah
Jahan ; and Mahabet Khan was entrusted with the command of
Prince Parviz’s army. When Prince Parviz with his army,
crossing the defile of Chanda! arrived in the Vilayet * of Mando,
Shah Jahin with his army sallied out of the fort of Mando, and
detached Rustam Khan® with a body of troops to encounter
Prince Parviz. Bahéu-d-din Barqandaz, one of the confidants
of Rustam Khan, a servant of Shih Jahan, held treason-
able correspondence with Mahabet Khan, and was waiting
for an opportunity, Atthe time when the two armies fell into
battle-array, Rustam Khan riding forward joined the Imperialists.
This wretched Rustam Khan was by Shah Jahan elevated from
the mangab of a Sehbasti * to that ofa Penjhazdri, and honoured with
the title of Rustam Khan and appointed Governor of Gujrat, and
he enjoyed the Prince’s fall confidence. Now that the Prince

appointing him generalissimo detached him to encounter Prince
Parviz, the wretch shelving the obligations of so many years’
kindness, joined Mahabet Khan. Owing to the occurrence of this
mishap, Shah Jahan’s aimy got demoralised, and all confidence
between each other was lost Many, going the high-way of
infidelity, fled. On hearing of this, Shah Jahan summoned the
remnant of the army to his side, crossed the river Narbada, and
removed the boats to his side of the mver-bank. Leaving Baiiim
Beg, the Pay-Master General of the Force, with a body of troops
on the banks of the river, Shah Jahin himself with the Khan-
i-Khanin and ‘Abdullah Khan and others proceeded towards the
fort of Asir and Burhanpur. Muhammad Taqi Bakshi intercept-
ing the letter of the Khin Khanan, which the latter had secretly
despatched to Mahabet Khan, produced it before Shah Jahan
On the top of the letter, this line was written :—

Pstoye HS yebry wo do
heh? £5 2 doy Si yy

Translation :

A hundred persons with their eyes watch me,
Or else I should have fled from this discomfort.

Shah Jahin summoning the Khin Khbanan with his gon
Darah Khan from his house, secretly showed him the letter. The
latter failed to give any satisfactory explanation. Consequently,
the Khan-i-Khanin with his son was kept in surveillance close to
the Prince’s quarters, and then the inauspiéious presage of the
line (quoted above) came to pass. Mahabet Khan sending secret
letters, had diverted the Khan Khanén from the path of loyalty,
through the persuasions of traitors And the Khan Khanan, by way
of advice, told Shih Jahan that asthe times were out of joint,
following the, saying. Jlmy dle 5h 93 aie 93 ly cites (Translation :
“Tf the times Go not fall in with you, you must adjust yourself
to the times ”) he should arrange for an armistice, as that would
be expedient di@Jdesirable in the interests of humanity, Shih
Jahan deeming the extinguishing of the fire of discord to be a great
achievement, called the Khin Khanan to his closet, and first reas-
sured his mind in respect of him by making the latter swear by
the Qordn. And the Khan Kbéndn placing his hand on the Qoran
swore with yehemence that he would never play false with the


--- Page 214 ---
187

Prince, nor turn disloyal, and that he would put forth his efforts
to bring about the welfare of both the parties. Thus being reas-
sured, Shah Jahan sent off the Khan Khanan, and kept Darab
Khan and his sons with himself. It was also settled that the
Khan Khanin should remain on this side of the river Narbada,
and by means of correspondence arrange terms of peace.
When news of the conclusion of an armistice and of the departure
of the Khan Khanan became known, the troops who had been
stationed to guard the banks of the river, ceasing to be vigilant
and alert, neglected to guard the ferries of the river. Of a night,
at a time when these were asleep, a body of Imperialists plunging
into the river with their horses, gallantly crossed over. <A great
lhubbub arose, and from panic men’s hands and feet wee
paralysed. Bairam Beg, ashamed of himself, went to Shah
Jahan. On hearing of the treachery of the Khan Khanan and of
the crossing of the river Narbada by the Imperialists, Shih
Jahén deeming it inexpedient to halt any further at Burhanpur,
crossed the river Tapti, in the thick of the rains, amidst o
storm-wave, and marched towards Orissa,! scouring the Province
of Qutbu-l-Mulk.®

1 The following is extracted from Bloch Tr, Ain, as it briefly and at the
same time lucidly desoribes Shah Jahin’s movements :—

“Shih Jahin rebelled, returned with Mirza Abdur Rahim Khin-i-Khanin
to Mando, and then moved to Burhanpir. On the march thither, Shih
Jahin intercepted a letter which Mirza Abdur Rahim had secretly written to
Mahabet Khan, whereupon he imprisoned him and his son Dirib Khan, and
sent them to Fort Asir, but released them soon after on parole. Parviz and
Mababet Khin had in the meantime arrived at the Narbadda to capture
Shah Jahin. Bairam Beg, an officer of Shih Jahin, had for this reason re+
moved all boats to the left mde of the river, and successfully prevented the
Imperiahets from crossing At Mirza Abdur Rahim’s advice, Shah Jahin
proposed at this time an armistice, He made him swear on the Qoran, and sent
him ag ambassador to Prince Parviz, Mahabet Khin, knowing that the fords
would not now be so carefully watched as before, effected a crossing, and
Mirza Abdur Rahim, forgetful of his oath, jomed Parviz and did not return
to Shih Jahin, who now fied from Burhanpur, marching throngh Talinganah
to Orissa and Bengal, Mahabet and Mirza Abdur Rahim followed him up a
short distance beyond the Tapti. . . Shih Jahin then moved into Bengal
and Behar, of which he made Dirib Khin Governor.” Bloch. Tr., Ain, Vol.

AN ACCOUNT OF THE ARRIVAL OF PRINCE SHAH
JAHAN’S ARMY IN BENGAL, AND THE FALL OF
IBRAHIM KHAN FATEH JANG.

When Prince Shih Jahin’s army reached Orissa, Ahmad Beg
Khan, nephew of Ibrahim Khan, Nazim of Bengal, who from before
hia uncle held the Deputy Governorship of Orissa} was out in the
interior to chastise some Zamindaérs. Suddenly hearing of the
arrival of the Prince, he lost all courage, and abandoning his
mission. he proceeded to Pipli! which was the Headquarters of the
Governor of that Province, and withdrew thence with his
treasures and effects to Katak, which fiom Pipli is 12 kroh
towards Bengal. Not finding himself strong enough to encamp
even at Katnk, he fled to Bardwan, and informed Saleh Beg,? nephew
of Ja‘fer Beg, of the whole affair. Saleh Beg did not credit the
news of the arrival of Shih Jahan in Orissa. At-this time, a
letter of a soothing tenour came from ‘Abdullah Khan to Saleh
Beg. The latter, not beimg won over, fortified the fort of
Baidwan, and entrenched himself there. And when Shah Jahan’s
army arrived at Bardwan, ‘Abdullah besieged the fort, and
Saleh Beg was hard-piessed. When things came to their worst,
and all hopes of relief wee lost, Saleh Beg was obliged
to surrender to ‘Abdullah Khan. The Khan putting
@ piece of cloth round the Beg’s neck, dragged him to the presence
of the Prince. When this thorn was put out of the way, the
banners of victory were raised aloft towards Rajmahal. When this

leh Beg) as 9 aon of Mirza Shahi, and nephew of Mirza Jafar Beg Asnf Khan

described as aman of the greatest genius, an able financier, and a capital ac-
countant His intelligence was such that he conid master the contents of a paga
by a glance; he was a great horticulturist: planting and lopping off branches
with own hands in tug gardens. He was alaoa great poet. He was Vakilu-
}-Mulk and a Commander of Five Thousand, under Emperor Jahangir. His
son Mirza Zsinul-abidin is mentioned in the Ain as a commander of 1,500
with 500 horse.

news reached Ibrahim Khan Fateh Jang,! who was Viceroy
of the Sibah of Bengal, he sank in the river of bewilderment.
Although his auxiliary forces were scattered about in the tract?
of Magha and in other places, mustering up courage, at
Akbarnagar otherwise called Rajmahal, he set himself to
strengthen the fortifications, to mobilize his troops, and to arrange
his forces and armaments. At this time, the message of the
Prince came to him, to the following effect: “Owing to the
decree of fate, whatever was predestined has passed from poten-
tiahty ito action; and the victorious army has come this
side. Though before the outlook of my aspiration, the extent of
this Province is nob wider than the area covered by the movement
of a glance, yet as this tract has fallen in my course, I cannot
summarily leave it. If you intend to pioceel to the Imperial
presence, and to stay my hand from meddling with your life,
property and family, [ tell you to set out in full security for
Delhi; or else if you cousider it expedient to tarry in this Pro-
vince, select any place in this Province that may suit you,
and you will be let alone there at ease and comfort.” Ibrahim
Khan in reply wrote: “The Hmperor has entrusted this country
to this, their old servant. So long as my head survives, I will cling
to this pravince; so long as my life lasts, I will hold out. The
beauties of my past life are kaowu to me; how little now remaius
of my future life in this world ? Now I have no other aspiration
than that, in the discharge of my obligations for past Royal
favours and in the pursuit of loyalty, I may sacrifice my life, and
obtain the felicity of martyrdom” In short, Ibiahim Khan at
first intended to shelter himself in the fort of Akbarnagar, but as
the fort was large, ard as he had not at his command a sufficiently
Jarge force to properly defend 1t fiom all sides, be entrenched
himself in his son’s mausoleum, which had a small rampart. Aé
this time, a body of Shah Jahin’s troops who were detailed to
garrison the Fort besieged the rampart of the mausoleum, and
from both inside and outside, the fire of arrows and muskets

blazed up. At the same time, Ahmad Beg Khan also arrived,
and entered the rampart. By his arrival, the hearts of the
besieged were somewhat encouraged As the family and children
of many of Ibrahim Khan’s party were on the other side of the
river, ‘Abdullah Khan and Daria Khan Afghan planned to cross
the river, and array their forces on the other side. Ibrahim
Khan! on hearing of this, became anxious. Taking in his com-
pany Ahmad Khan, Ibrahim marched confounded to the other side,
left other persons to protect the fortifications of the mausoleum,
and sent in advance of himself war-vessels, so that these seizing
the routes of march of the Prince’s army, might prevent his crogs-
ing over.

1 Mirza Ghiis Beg’s third son was Ibrahim Khan Fateh Jing. He was a
brother of the Empress Nir Jahin, and through her influence, became Gover-
nor of Bengal and Behar, under Jahangir. He was killed near his son’s tomb
at Raymehal, durmg Shih Jahan’s rebellion. His son had died young, and
waa buried near Rajmahal, on the banks of the Ganges ( Tuzuk, p 383),
His nephew, Ahmad Beg Khan, on Ibrahim’s death, retreated to Dacca,
where he handed over to Shih Jahin 6500 elephants, and 45 lacs of rupees
(Tuzuk, p 884). See also Padshahnamah 11,727 and Bloch. Tr., Ain, Vol.

But before the war-vessels ariived, Daria Khan had crossed the
river, Ibrahim Khan on being apprised of this, directmg Ahmad
Beg to cross the river, sent him to oppose Dana Khan.t When
the two armies encountered each other, a great battle ensued on
the banks of the river, and a large number of Ahmad Beg’s
comrades were killed. Ahmad Beg, not findmg himself strong
enough to stand lus ground, retired. Ibrahim Khan witha corps
of well-mounted cavalry, joined him. Daria Khan, on hearing of
this, retired a few kroh, and Abdillah Khan Bahadur Firuz Jang *
also advancing afew ‘oh, under guidance of zamindars, crossed
the river, and joined Daria Khan. By chance, on a site which is
flanked on one side by tlie river and on the other by a dense
jungle, they encamped, and arayed their troops for battle.
Ibrahim Khin, crossing the iver Ganges, set to fight. He detach-
ed Syed Nirullah,® an officer, with eight hundred cavaliy to form

1 Dana Khin was a Rohilla general under Shah Jahan. In the begin-
ning, he was employed under Shaikh Farid, and under Shurifn-1-Mulk, distin-
guished himself in the battle of Dholpir. After the battle of Benares, he
deserted Shih Jahin (See Maaswu-l-Umara, p. 18, Vol IZ)

8 When Rajab Partab, Rajah of Bhojpur or Ujjain (west of Arrah) revolt-
ed against the Emperor Shab Jahan, in the 10th year of Shih Jahan’s reign,
Abdillih Khin Firuz Jang besieged and captured Bhoypiir (1016 A.H.)
Partab surrendered, and was executed, his wife became a Muhammadan and
‘was married to Abdiillah’s grandson. (See Pudghahnamah 1, b. pp. 271 to
274 and Maasiru-l-Umara, p. 777, Vol II)  Abdillah Khin, though he was
thoroughly loyal to Prmce Shih Jnhin at the battle of Benares, subsequently
seceded from the Prince, und submitted to Jahangir through the intercession
of Khin Jahan (Seep 248, Fasc 3, Iqbalnamah-1-Jahang1iz)

8 One Mir Nirullah is mentioned m the Ain amongst the learned men of
Akbar’s time. It is evident the Nirullah in the text was a Syed of Barha;
for the Syeds of Barha from Akbar’s tame were enrolled in the Army, and
claimed their place in battle im the van or haraol. Many of these Barha
Syeds for their military or political services to the State, were honoured by
the Mughal Emperors with the honorific distinction of “ Khin,” which m
course of time very often obliterated all traces of their being Syeds, For
instance, Syed Alf Asghar, son of Syed Mahmid of Barhs, received the
title of ‘ Saif Khin’ under Jahangir, bis nephew Syed Jafar received the title
of ‘Shujat Khin’, Syed Jafai’s nephew, Syed Sultin, received the title of

the van, and set Ahmad Beg Khan with seven hundied cavalry
to form the centre; whilst he himself with thousands of cavalry
and infantry, held the line of reserve. A great battle ensued,
when the two forces encountered each other. Niirullah being
unable to stand his ground, retreated, and the fighting extended
to Ahmad Beg Khan The latter gallantly continuing the fight,
‘was seriously wounded. Ibrahim Khin being unable to be a
passive spectator of the scene, advanced rapidly By this forward
movement, the array of his force was disturbed. Many of his
followers stooped to the disgrace of flight, whilst Ibrahim Khan
with a, few troops only advanced to the battle-field. Although the
officers of his staff seizing him, wanted to drag him out from
that labyrinth of destruction, he did not assent to retreat, and
raid: “At my time of life, this cannot be, What can be better
than that, sacrificmg my life, I should be reckoned amongat the
Joyal servants of the Emperor”? At this juncture, the enemy
from all sides rushing up, inflicted on him mortal wounds, finished
his work, and victory declared itself for the adherents of the
fortunate Prince. And a body of men who were entrenched
inside the rampart of the mausoleum, on being apprised of this,
weie depressed At this time, the Prince’s army set fire to a
mine which they had laid under the rampart, whilst gallant and
intrepid soldiers rushing up from all sides stormed the forti-
fications. In this assault, ‘Abid Khan Diwan and Mir Taqi
Bakhshi and some others were killed by arrows and muskets, and
the fort was stormed. Many of the gattison of the fort fled
bare-headed and bare-footed, whilst a number of people with whom

family and children, effects and treasures were at Jahangirnagar
(Dacca), Shah Jahan’s army proceeded there by river Ahmad Beg

1 For a graphic contemporary account of this warfare, see Iqbalnamah-i-
Jahangiri (Pers. text, Faso. 8, pp. 218~221), and the Tuauk (p. 883). Ibrahim
Khan was killed near the tomb of his son at Rajmahal, on the banks of the
Ganges Our author appears to have borrowed his account (in an abridged
form) from the Iqbalnamah, though there are shght variations, In the text
we are told that Ibrahim Khin at the battle had with him “ thousands of
cavalry and intantry,” whilst in the “ Iqbalnamah,” it is mentioned that
Thrahim Khan had with hiv onlv “ one thousand cavalry.”

4 Ibrahim Khin Fatih Jang was a son of ‘Itamd-u-daulah Mirza Ghiis.
His real name was Mirza Ibrahim.

In the commencement of his career, he held the office of Bakhshi and
Wagia-navis ab Ahmadabad in Gujrat, In the 9th year of Jahangir's reign.
he received the title of Khan’ and the mangab of hazar and pangadi, and
was promoted to the office of Imperial Bakhsh, ahd tyag gradually farther
advanced to the rank of Panjhazari and to the office of Subadar (or Viceroy)
ot Bengal and Orissa, receiving at the same time tho titles of “ Ibrahim Khin
Fatih Jang.” In the 19th year of Jahangir’s reign, Prince Shah Jahin
invaded Orissa and Bengal vid Telingana. On hearing of this news, Ibrahim
Khan moved from Dacca (which was then the Viceregal Capital, and where his
family and treasures were) to Akbarnagar or Raymahal. Princo Shah Jahin
sent messengers to him, to win him over to his mde, but he proved unflinching
in lus loyalty to the Emperor, and foll fightmg heroically in the battle of
Rajmahal, uear the mausoleum of his son. Tbrahim Khin’s reply to Prince
Shah Jahan, is a model of dignified and firm protest couched in the heat dip-
lomatic form of the Persian language, and is worth quotmg:—

Khan'!, nephew of Ibrahim Khan, who had gone ahead to that
city, saw no resource except in surrender, and through the

Jahangir’s accession, between the Afghans under Khwajah Osman Lohani,
and the Mughal Imperialists under Shujait Khin Rustam-i-Zamin (Shaikh
Kabir-i-Chishti),—a battle which finally crushed Afghan resistance in Bengal
and Orissa, and firmly consohdated Mughal supremacy throughout these
Provinces. (See pp. 60-64, Fasc. 1, Pers, printed text of Igbalnamah-i.
Jahangiri, a contemporary record, and also Tuzuk for fascinating descriptions
of this sangumary and decisive battle near Dacca), Stewart wrongly places
‘the battle “on the banks of the Subarnarika in Orissa.” Osman being stout,
rode ai the battle on a rogue elephant called Bakita. Many Imperialist
leaders, such aa Syed Adam Barha, Shaikh Agha, Iftikhir Khin, Kighwar
Khan fell at the battle, which was half decided in favour of Osman, when a
chance arrow-shot wounded Osman on the forehead, and, coupled with the
arrival, of Mughal reinforcement under Mu’tagqid Khan and Abdis Salam
Khia, saved the Mughal disaster, and turned it into a victory.

It would appear that when in the 19th year of Jahangir’s reign corre-
sponding’ to 1083 AH Prince Shah Jahan rebelling against his father, invad«
ed Bengal, the Mughal Bengal Viceroy, Ibrahim Khin Fateh Jang (a relation
of Empress Nir Jahan) had moved from his capital at Dacca or Jahangir-
nagar to Rajmahal or Akbarnagar. The Igbalnamah-i-Jahangir (p, 218, Fase. 8,
printed text), a contemporary record, states that Ibrahim’s troops were
scattered at the time on the borders of Magha, which signifies South Western
Behar. Owing to paucity of troops (the Maaswr explains otherwise), Ibrahim
did not think of fortifying the fort of Rajmahal which waa large, bub en-
trenched himself in the mausoleum of his son, situate within the Fort and
alose to the river Ganges. Shah Jahin moved from Burhanpiir in the Dakhin
across Talingana into Orissa, overran it across Pipli and Katak, and moyed
to Bardwan acrogs Sarkar Madaran, and after capturing Bardwan (where
Salih was commandant) marched up to Rajmahal, where the great battle was
fought, and after defeating Ibrahim Khién, proceeded to Dacca, whither
Ahmad Beg Khin (nephew of Ibrahim and of Empress Nir Jahan) had previ-
ously retreated after Ibrahim’s death. Ahmad Beg surrendered to Shih Jahan
wat Dacea (according to the Tuzuk and Maasir) with forty-five lacs of treasure
and 500 elephants. Shah Jahan leaving Darab Khan (a son of Mixza Abdur
Rahim Khiv Khanén) as Governor of Bengal, marched back westward across
Bengal, Behar and Jaunpur to Benares, where he waa opposed and checked by
Mahabet Khan. (See Jgbalnamah-+-Jahangirs, Faso, 8, Pera. text, Pp. 216, 216,
217, 222, 228, 228, 238, 289), Shih Nawaz Khan was the eldest son of Abdir
Rahim Khin-i-Khinin ; his life also is given in the Maasir-ul-Umara.

\ Ahmad Beg Khan was a son of Muhammad Sharif, and a nephew of
Ibrahim Khan Fateh Jang, the Bengal Viceroy, and of Empress Nir Jahan.
At the time of Prince Shih Jahin’s incursion into Orissa and Bengal, he was

against Khurda, On hearing of Shih Jahiin's inyasion, he withdrew to Pipli

intercession of Shah Jahan’s confidants, was granted an audience
with the Prince. The Prince’s officers were ordered to contis-
cate Ibrahim Khan’s treasures. Besides goods and silk-stuffs,
elephants and aloes wood, ambergris and other rarities, forty
lacs of rupees were confiscated. The Prince released from confine-
ment Darab Khan, son of the Khan-i-Khanin, who had hitherto
been in prison, and exaeting from him an oath, entrusted to him
the Government of Bengal, and took along with him as hostages
the latter’s wife and a son, Shah Newz Khin.! The Prince sent
Rajah Bhim,’ son of Rajah Karan, with a large force, as his
Deputy to Patna, and he followed himself with ‘Abdullah

(his head-quarters), thence to Katak, and not feeling himself secure even
there, marched. first to Bardwan, whence he went to Rajmahal or Akbarnagar,
and joined his uncle Ibrahim Khan. Being defeated in the battle there,
Ahmad Beg moved to Dacca (which was then the Viceregal capital of Bengal,
and where the family and treasures “f Ibrahim Khan were), but was soon
overtaken there by Prince Shih Jahin, to whom he surrendered. On Shah
Jahin’s accession, he was appointed Faujdar of Siwastan. (See Maasw-wl-
Umara, p. 194, Vol. 1).

1 In the text there is some mistake. When Da1ib Khin (second son of
Mirza Abdur Rahim Khin-i-Khinan) was made Governor of Bengal, Shah
Jahin took his wife, a son and a daughter, and also @ son of Shih Nawaz Khan
(eldest:son. of the Khan-i-Khimin) as hostages (see Maasw-vl-Umara). Shih
Nawaz was not taken as a hostage, as the tert vould imply. Darib was
subsequently killed by Mahabet Khin, at the instance of Jahangir. The
following chronogram is given in the Maasir-ul-Umara (p. 17, Vol. II), as
yielding the date of Darab’s death (1084 A.H.):—

& Ram Dag, the Kachwah Rajpit, was at first attached as usib in the
Financial Department under Todar Mal, and soon gained Akbar’s favour by
his regularity and industry. Emperor Jahangir conferred on him the title of
* Rajah Karan,’ but owing to his disgraceful flight during the wars in the
Dakhin, he lost Jahangir’s favour. Jahangir is stated to have cursed him
thus:—“Whon thou wert in Rai Sal’s service, thou hadst a tankah per diem;
but my father took an interest in thee, and made thee an Amir. Do not
Rajpits think flight a disgraceful thing? Alas, thy title, Rajah Karan,
onght to have taught thee better, Mayest thou die without the comforts of
thy faith.’ His sons were Naman Das and Dalap Dias—Bhisa Das is not
moritioned amongst his sons (see Bloch. Tr., Ain, Vol. I, p. 483). But one
Bhim Singh is mentioned (see Bloch. Tr., Ain, Vol. I, p. 418), amongst the
grandsons of Madhu Singh, son of Rajah Bhagwan Dis. This Bhim Singh wax
killed in the Dakhin, in the 8rd year of hth Jahan’s reign. Another Rana
Karan is mentioned in the Maasir-ul-Umara (p, 201, Vol, IT).

Khan and other officers. As the Sibah of Patna was assigned
as a jagir to Prince Parviz, the latter had appointed his Diwan,
Mukhalas Khan, as its Governor, and Alah Yar Khan, son of
Iftikhar Khan, and Sher Khan Afghau, as its Faujdars. On the
arrival of Rajah Bhim, they lost courage, and Fad not even
the boldness to shelter themselves in the fort of Patna,
till the arrival of auxiliaries. They fled fiom Patna to Allahabad.
Rajah Bhim without movement of the sword or the spear,
entered the city, and subdued the Sabah of Behar. Shah
Jahan followed, and the Jagirdairs of that tract went to
meet him. Syed Mubarik, who was Commandant of the fort of
Rohtas, leaving the fort in charge of a zamindar, hastened to pay
his respects to the prince. The Priuce sent Abdullah Khan with a
body of troops towards the Sibah of Allahabad,and sent Daria Khan
with another body of troops towards the Sabah of Oudh, whilst
after a while, leaving Bairém Beg to rule over the Sibah of
Behar, the Prince himself advanced towards those parts. Before
Abdullah Khan crossed the river at Chansa, Jahangir Quli Khan?

and Behar vid Telingana and Orissa, and advanced towardg Paima, after the

Sher Khan Afghan), instead of holdmg ont in the fort of Patna, fled to
Allahahad. After Shih Jahin’s accession, Mukhalis Khan was appointed
Vapjder of Gorakpur, and in the seventh year of Shah Jahin’s reign, -was-
appointed a commander of Three Thousand and also Sibadar of Telmgans.
He died in the 10th year of Shih Jahin’s reign, (See p. 428, Vol.. Ill,

to Allahabad. Abdullah quickly advanced to the town of Jhosi,
which is on the other side of the Ganges facing Allahabad, and
encamped there. As he had taken a flotilla of large vessels with
him from Bengal, with the help of cannonade crossing the river,
he encampe at the pleasantly-situate city of Allahabad, whilst
the main body of Shah Jaban’s army pushed up to Jaunpir.

PRINCE SHAH JAHAN’S FIGHTINGS WITH THE
IMPERIAL ARMY, AND HIS WITHDRAWAL TO
THE DAKHIN.

When news of Shah Jahin’s advance towards Bengal
and Orissa reached the Emperor, he sent orders to Prince Parvjz
and Mahabet Khan, who were in the Dakhin, to march
quickly towards the Subahs of Allahabad and Behir, so that in case
the Nazim of Bengal was unable to oppose successfully the advance
of Shah Jahan’s army, they were toengage Shah Jahan. In the
meantime, news of the fall of Nawab Ibrahim Khan Fateh Jang,

at Chansa to proceed te Allahabad, Jahangir Quh Khan fled from Jaunpir to
Allahabad and joined Mirza Rustam Safavi there. He subsequently became
Governor of Allahabad, and on §hah Jahan’s accession, was appointed
Governor of Sirat and Jimagarh. He died in 1041 A.H. at Siirat. (See
Maasir-ul-Omara, p. 524, Vol. I, Pers. text).

1 Mirza Rustam Safavi was a son of Sultin Husain Mirza, grandson of
Shah Ismail, king of Persia. Mirza Rustam was appointed by Akbar, ttoyer-
nor of Multan; Akbar also made him a Panjhazari, and gave him Multen ag
Jagir. One of his daughters was married to Prince Parviz, and another to
Shah Shuja’. He enjoyed great influence with Jahangir who made him a
Shaskhazari, and also Governor of Allahabad, which he successfully held
against Shah Jahin'’s General, Abdallah Khan, forcing the latter to retire to
Jhosi. He was subsequently Governor of Behar. Shah Juhin pensioned
him off, and he died at Agra in 1051. lt is worthy of ‘interest to note that
his grandson, Mirza Safshikan (son of Mirza Hasan Safavi) was Fauiderof
Jesaore in Bengal, where he died in 1073 (aee Bloch. Tr., Ain, p, 814,Wqh I).
After him, I guess Mirzanagar (a seat of old Jessore Musalman Faujdars) is
named. The family still survives there, though impoverished-/Safehikan’s
80D, Mirza Saifu-d-din. Safavi, accepted the title of “Khan” undex
Emperor Aurangzeb. (See Maasir-ul-Umara, Pers. text, p. 478, Vol. TTI),
The Maastr (printed text).states that on the death of his father, Mirza
Hasan Sufavi, Mirza Safshikan was appointed Fanjdar of ‘Hast’ in Bengal.

Nazim of Bengal, reached the Emperor, who thereon repeated his
previous orders to Prince Parviz! and Mahabet Khan. Prince
Parviz with Mahabet Khan and other officers marched towards
Bengal and Behar. As the Commander of Shah Jahan’s army,
drawing the boats towards his side, had fortified the ferries of
the river Ganges, some delay was caused in the arrival of the
Imperialists. The Imperialists, with considerable difficulty, col-
lected thirty flotillas of boats from the zamindars, and under the lat-
ter’s guidance selecting one ford, succeeded in crossing over. For
some days, both the armies arrayed themselves in front of each
other. As the Imperialists numbered 40,000, whilst Shah Jahin’s
army did not number more than 10,000, the advisers of
Shah Jahan dissuaded the Prince from offering battle. But
Rajah Bhim, son of Rana Karan, unlike other advisers, displayed
rashness, and with the rashness common to Rajputs insisted that
he would part company, unless they agreed to fight. Prince
Shah Jahan, of necessity, considered it expedient to humour Bhim’s
wishes, despite paucity of troops, and passed orders for fighting.
Both sides rallying into ranks, commenced to fight. *

On both sides, the troops rallied .nto ranks,
Holding in hand daggers, arrows and spears.

1 Prince Parviz was the second son of Emperor Jahangir, and » great
fayourite with the latter, He imitated his father in everything, “in dress,
in quaffing wing, in eating, and in night-keepmg” (Igbalnamah-t-Jahangtrt,
Fase, 8, p. 278), and “never disobeyed his Imperial father’s wishes.’ He
died at the age of 88 yoars in the Dakhin, where he was employed in sub-
jugating the country and in quelling the ingurrection of Malik Amber, in
1085 A.H,, that 1s, in the twenty-first year of Emperor Jahangir’s accession
to the throne. He rendered also important services to his father, m opposing
Shih Jahin’s invasion of Bengal, Behar, and Orissa, and with the help of Ins
generalisamo, Mahabet Khin, defeated Shih Jahin at Benares, and obliged
the latter to abandon Behar, Bengal and Orissa, and to beat a hasty retreat
to theDakhin. (See pp. 288, 289, 240, 278, 279, Igbalnamah-i-Jahangws, Fasc
3, Pers. text, which is a contemporary record),

8 See description of this battle at Benares between the Imperialists under
Prince Parviz and Mahabet Khan, and Shih Jahin’s troops, in the Ighalnamah-
i.Jahangiri, a contemporary record, p. 288, Pers text. Shah Jahin was
totally defeated, owing to the rashness of his favourite officer, Rajah Bhim,
who himself fell fighting, being out to pieces by the Imperialiste. -The
Maanr-ul-Umara states that the battle took place un the side of cig 43

(Nahr-é-Tunas) in the Suburbs of Benares.

They tramped up to the field for fighting,

Yea the fire of war blazed up.

First from both sides, the artillery of the gunners,
Commenced scattering fire on the hosts. :
From the smoke of the gun-waggons of the two forces,
You might say a pitchy cloud had formed.

The cannon-balls showered like hail,

Yea a storm of destruction blew :

Yea the heads and hands, the breasts and feet of the Com-
Biew like wind on all sides. (manders,
From blood, yea on every side a stream flowed,

Yea like fish, the bodies of the heroes throbbed.

On every side showered stone-rending arrows ;

They passed right through every body that they lodged in.
From swords and spears, breasts were torn to shreds ;
The corpses of heroes fell on the ground.

But the Imperialists, like stars,

Hemmed in on the army of the Prince.

They surrounded the latter in that battle,

Yea as the ring encircles the finger.

From Shah Jahan’s army, Rajah Bhim the valorons,
Was not cowed down by this slaughter.

Some of his race who were his comrades,

Hurled themselves on the enemy's force.

They spurred their horses, yea like lions in fight,
They drew swords, yea like wate: dragons.

By one gallant charge, they broke the enemy's ranks,
And swiftly attacked the enemy’s centre.

Whoever stood in the way of that force,

They hurled down Ins head on the dust.

Bnt the veteran Imperialists,

When they saw that suddenly a calamity had come.
Spurred on their chargers from every side,

And attacked that elephant-hke hero, Bhim.

They cut up his body with the sword,

And horled him down from his steed on the dust.
Other commanders and officers (of Shah Jahan).
Could not advance to his (Bhim’s) rescue.

The gunners, on seeing this crisis, leaving the artillery,

fled, and the arsenal was captured by the Imperialists. Daria
Khan and other Afghins and Generale ceasing to fight, decamped.
The Tmperialists, collecting from all sides like a circle formed by
a pair of compasses, surrounded the Prince, who remained at the
centre. Save and except the elephants carrying flags and standards,
and select targeteers who were behind the Prince, and ‘Abdullah
Khin who stood to his right-hand side at a short distance, not a
single soul remained. At this moment, an arrow hit the horse
of the Prince. When ‘Abdullah Khan saw that the Prince would
not retire from the field, he moved up, and by use of great
entreaties and exhortations, succeeded in bringing out the Prince
from the field, and placing before him his own horse, induced the
Prince to mount it. In short, from the battle-field up to Rohtas,
the contest did not cease. As at this time, Prince Murad Bakhsh!
was born, and long marches could not be made, leaving him to
the protection of God and appointing Khedmit Parast Khan and
some other trusty se: vants to take care of him, Shah Jahan with
other Princes and adherents slowly marched towards Patna and
Behar. At the same time, letters were r:eceived from people in
the Dakhin, especially from Malik ‘Ambar? the Abyssiman

l He was the fourth and youngest son of Sauh Jahin, whose other sons
were (1) Dara Shekoh, (2) Shih Shuja (8) Aurangzch.—Sce p 3806, Iqbal-
namah-t-Jahangi i, Fase 8, Pers. text

® He gave no end of trouble to Jahangir. His insurrection is fully
described in the Iqbalnamah-1-Juhangurt, a contemporary recoid, Fase. 3,
pp 234 to 288 =The anthor of the Igbalnamah-1-Jahangim pays a high tribute
to his military genius and generalship, to his administrative capacity and
vigorous rule m the Daklin (See p, 271, Fasc 8, Igbalnamah-1-Jahangirw
Pers. text). He died at the ripe old age of eighty, holding his own against
the Imperialists to the last. After Malik Ambar the Abyssiman’s death, ins
generalissimo, Yaqiit Khin the Abyssiman, together with Malik Amber's son,
Fatih Khin, and other officers of Nizam-ul-Mulk, submitted to Khin Jahan,
Jahangiz’s Viceroy or Subadar in the Dakhin, in the twenty-first year of

on knowing the disloyalty and villainy of Darab Khan, slew
the latter’s grown-up son, and satisfied Ins grudge. Although
Shah Jahan sent orders to prevent the son being killed, these had
no effect When the news of Shah Jahan’s retreat from Bengal
to the Dakhin reached the Emperor, the latter ordered that
Mukhalas Khan should quickly go to Prince Parviz, who had
gone to Bengal in pursuit of Shih Jahin, and taking up the office of
Sazawal (Superintendent of Revenue), should send the Prince with
other leading noblemen to the Dakhin. Consequently, Prince
Parviz left for the Dakhin, entrusting the Stbah of Bengal

THE ASSIGNMENT OF BENGAL IN JAGIR TO
MAHABET, KHAN! AND HIS SON.

When the Sibah of Bengal was assigned,in the shape of
Jagir, to Nawab Mahabet Khan and his son Khanahzid Khan,

1 Mahabet Khan distinguished himself under Emperor Jnhangr m the
long war carried on im the Dakhjn. He was early attached by the Emperor
to Prince Parviz, as atalig and generalissimo, when the Prince was sent to the
Dakhm to quell the imsurrection there. Where Prince Shah Jahan subse-
quently rebelled against his father (Emperor Jahangir), and marching ont
from the Dakbin across Talingana mvaded Orissa and over-ran Bengal and
Behar, the Hmperor ordered Mahabet Khan along with Prince Parviz to oppose
Shih Jahin’s mogress In this, Meahabet Khin (along with Prince Parviz)
completely succeaded, inflicted a crushmg defeat on Shah Jahan on the battle-
field of Benares, and compelled the latter to beat a hasty retreat across
Behar, Bengal and Onsaa into the Dakhin For this signal military service,
Mahabet Khan received from Prince Parviz (no doubt, with the previous sanc-
tion of the Emperor) Bengal m yag?r. His head was soon turned, and he failed
tosend to the Emperor the war-elephants taken by him m Bengal, and also
failed to remit the Impenal revenue from Bengal For this, the Emperor
summoned him to hie presence for chastisement, when Mahabet Khan adopted
the extraordinary and »mpudent step of getting at the person of the Nmperor,
and plaomg the latter for some tame under surveillance—from which at
Jength the Emperor was rescued by the bold stratagem of his Queen, Nur
Jahin Begam. Mehabet was then sent away m disgrace to Thata, whence he
‘went to Gujrat,'and joined the rebel Prince, Shah Jahin. (See pp 228, 238,
285, 288, 239, 244, 245, 248, 252, 258, 254, 265, 256, 257, 268, 259, 260, 261,

they, parting company with Prince Parviz, marched to Bengal,
And orders were given to the zamindars of that country to cease
impeding Daréb Khan, and to allow him tocome, Darab Khan,
without any impediment, came to Mahabet Khan. But when the
news of Darab’s coming to Mahabet Khan reached the Emperor,
the latter sent an order to Mahabet Khan to the following effect :
“What expediency dost thou see in sparing that villain? It behoves
you, instantly on reading this, to send the head of that mischievous
rebel to the Imperial presence.” Mahabet Khan, cart ying out the
Emperor's order, beheaded Dar&b Khan, and sent the latter’s head
to the Emperor. And as Mahabet Khan had not sent to the
Emperor the elephants that he had captured in Bengal, and had
defaulted in payment of a large amount of the Imperial Revenue,
the Emperor passed orders to the effect that ‘Arab Dast Ghaib!
should go to Mahabet Khan, confiscate the elephants and send
them to the Emperor, and tell Mahabet Khan, that if he got proper
accounts, he should submit them personally to the Emperor, and
pay up all Revenue arrears to the Imperial exchequer.’ Mahabet
Khan first sent the elephants to the Emperor, and subsequently
after appointing his son Khanahzad Khan to be Subadar of
Bengal, set out to meet the Emperor with four or five thousand

From the Maastr-ul-Umara (p 885, Vol. III), the following additional
facts about Mahabet Khin are gleaned. His real name was Zamansh Beg,
his futher’s name being Ghiwar Beg Kabuli. He was a Razavi Sayyid.
Ghiwar Beg came from Shiraz to Kabul, and thence to India, and entered
Akbar’s service, and distmguished himself in the battle of Chitor. ZYamanah
Beg, in youth, entered Prince Salim’s service as an ahads, and soon was
advanced to the office of Bakhshi under the Prince. In the beginning of
Jahangir’s reign, Zamanah Beg was appointed to be commander of three
thousand, and received the title of Mahabet Khin. He was deputed to serve
with Prince Shih Jahin in the Dakhin, and in the 12th year of Jahangir's
xeign, was appointed Sibadar of Kabil. In the 17th year, dissensions broke
out between Emperor Jahangir and Prince Shih Jahin, and Mahabet Khin
was recalled from Kabul. When Shah Jahan ascended the throne, he ad-
vanced Mahabet Khin to the rank of Hajt hasar7, and conferred on him the,
title of “ Khin-i-Khanin Sipisilar,” and appointed him Sitbadar of Ajmir, and
next, Subadar of the Dakhin. He died in 1044 A.H.

1 He appearsto have been employed by Emperor Jahangir on similar
migsions with reference to other refractory princes and officers, such as Hoshang,
son of Prince Danyal, and Abdor Rahim Khin-i-Khanan and Mahabev Khin,
(See p, 244, Igbalnamah-s-Jahangirt Pers. text, Faso. 3, and also Maasr-ul-
Umara, p. 892, Vol. 8).

blood-thirsty Rajput cavalry, and resolved inwardly that in ease
any harm or injury were attempted against his honour, property
or life, he with his family and children would be prepared to face
martyrdom. When news of his arrival reached the Emperor, order
was passed that he would not be granted an audiences, so long as
he did not pay up the Revenue arrears to the Imperial Exchequer,
and so long as he did not redress by exercise of justice the public
grievances against him. Afterwards sammoning to his presence
Barkhurdar, son of Khwaja! Nakghbandi, to whom Mababet Khan,
withont* the Emperor's approval, had betrothed his daughter, the
Emperor had him disgracefully whipped and thrown into prison,
with his neck bound and head bare. In the morning, Mahabet
Khan rede out with his cavalry, and without making oheisance to
the Emperor, ia an insolent and daring manner broke open the
door of the Emperor’s Private Chamber,’ entered it with four
hundred or five hundred Rajputs, saluted the Emperor in hunting
and travelling suit, and marched back towards his own residence.*

was an eye-witness of what occurred. From the account that he gives, it

Tn short as the Imperial army had gone towards Thatah, Mahabet
Kbin was ordered to join it there. In the meantime, Prince Parviz
died. As Sharif Khan! had entrenched himself in the fort of
Thatah, Sh&b Jahan’s army marched back tothe Dakhin. Mahabet
Khan after reaching Thatah sent letters to Shah Jahan, avowing
his loyalty, and Shah Jéhan being conciliated, Mahabet Khan
entered the former's service. In consequence, the Sibah of Bengal
was transferred from Khinahzad Khan, son of, Mahabet Khan, ta
Mokkaram Khan,’ son of Muazzam Khan, and the Province of

Khin, leaving some Rajput troops to guard the bridge, marched up to the
Imperial tent with a large number of Rajpnt cavalry. At the time, the
Emperor was reposing m the Khaskhiné. Méahabet Khan fearlessly broke
open the door, and entered it with about 500 Rajput cavalry, and paid
obeisance tothe Hmperor. The Emperor coming out of the tent, seated
himself on the Imperial Palanquin, which had Iain in front of the tente
Mihabet Khiin came quite close to the palangnin, and addressed the Emperor
as follows: “Fearing that through the vindictiveness and malice of Amf

daring step of personally throwing myself on the Imperial protection. Sires
if I deserve to be killed and punished, kill and punish me in fyour Impenal
presence” (p. 256, Fase 3, Igbalnamah). In the meantime, Mababet Khén’s
Rayput cavalry surrounded the Imperial tent from all sides. Then Mahat et
Khin told the Emperor that that was the usual time for the Emperor to go
out hunting, and asked the Emperor to mount « horse. The Emperor mount-
ed ® horse, and went out some distance and then léaving the horse mounted
nn elephant, Miaihabet Khan in hunting dress accompanied the Emperor ant
led the latter to his own camp. Winding that Nur Jahan Begam had heon
left behind, he led back the Emperor to the Imperial tent, but in the mean-
time Nor Jahan had gone across the river and had joined her brother, Asif
Khan and was busy concerting measures to rescue the Emperor. After some
days, by adoption of an genious and a bold stratagem—when the efforts of
all the Imperial officers had failed—Nur Jahan succeeded in rescuing her
Royal Consort, and m banishing Mihabet Khan, who was sent in disgrace
to Thatah. (See p. 276, Fasc. 8, Igbainamah s-Jahangiri) Malabet Khan
subsequently joined Shah Jahan in the Dakhin.

1In the Igbalnamah, “Sharifu-J-Mulk” it appeara thet Prince Shih
Jahan had gone from the Dakhin to invade the province of Thateh. Then
Sharifn-l-Mulk, on behalf of Prince Shabriyir, held the Fort of Thatab with
4,000 cavulry and 10,000 infantry, On hearing the news, the Emperor
Jahangir sent an Imperial army to repel Shih Jahin’s invasion, and Mababet.
Khan was sent on the same errand. Qhih Jehan wasobliged éc raise the
siege, and to march bavk to the Dakhin vid Gujrat. (See Igbainamah and alae

and significant from the modern stand-point, as the chronicle of this adminis.
tration contains, for the first time, a reference toa conflict (no doubt, then ux
important) between the Christian European merchants in Bengal and the
Musalman Vicsroys of Bengal. To supplement the account of this Musalman
Vi-oroy wih some additional facts gleaned from the Maasw-ul-Umara, would
therefure be interosting

Qisim Khin was a son of Mir Murad of Juain (in the Vilayet of Baihaq)
Mir Murad was a leading Sayyid of that place, whence he migrated into the
Dakhin. He was brave and « capital archer, and was engaged by Emperor
Akbar to train up Prince Khurram. He was subsequently appomted Bakshi
of Lahore, m the 46th year of Akbar’s reign. His son, ‘“ Qism Khan” (this
was evidently Ins title, his aotual name 1s not given in the Maasir) wasa
man of oulture and literary habits. Under Islim Khin Qhishti Farigi
(Jahangic’s Bengal Viceroy), Qasim Khan served as Khazanchi or Treasurer-
General of Bengal. Islim Khin took particular interest in training him up.
Some timea fter, Qisim Khan was lucky in getting married to Manijah Begam,
sister of the Empress Nir Jahin. This matrimonial alliance was a turning
point in Qisim Khin’s fortune; he was soon advanced in rank and dignity.
The witty courtiers of the time called hm “Qasim Khiin Manijah” He soon
became an associate of the Emperor Jahangir. Towards the end of J ahangir’s
reign, he was appointed Siibadar (or Viceroy) of Agra In the firat year of
Shih Jahin’s reign, the Emperor (Shih Jehan) raised him to the Mangab of
Panghazurt, and appointed him Siibadar (Viceroy) of Bengal, in place of
Fidei Khin. During his stay in Bengal (durmg Jahangir’s reign), Shah
Jahin had become personally apprised of the excesses practiced by the
Christians (Portugnese, obviously) resident in the Port of Hughli. For in-
stance, Shah Jahin had come to know that these often took unauthorised leases
of adjoining pargannas, oppressed the tenantry of those pargannas, and some-
times by tempting offers, converted them to Christianity, and even sent them
to Farang (or Hurope). Further these Christians (Portuguese, obviously)
carried on similar malpractices even in pargannas, with which they had no
connection. Further, these Christians; under the pretext of carrying on
trading transactions, ad in the beginning established some ware-honses
which they had gradually and clandestinely, by bribing local officers, converted
inte large fortified buildings. In consequence, the bulk of the trade which had
found its way, hitherto, to the old Imperial emporium at Sitgaon, was
diverted to the new port of Hughli. In consideration of the above circum.
stances, the Emperor Shah Jahan, whilst sending Qisim Khan to Bengal

admuistration, and to the putting down of disturbances. In the
sixth year of Shah Jahan’'s accession, he marched against the
Christians and Portuguese who had become insolent in the port of
Hnghli, and after fighting expelled and defeated them. As a
reward for this service, he received favours from the Emperor,
but he soon after died.

NEZAMAT OF NAWAB ‘AZAM KHAN.

Afte: this, Nawab ‘Azam Khan! was appointed to the
Negimat of Bengal. As he could not properly discharge the

as his Viceroy, gave the latter instructions to expel the foreign Christian
(Portuguese) traders from the port of Hughli. Accordingly, in the 4th year of
Shih Jahin's reign, Qisim Khin sent his gon *Inaitnllah Khan in com.
pany of Alohyar Khan and other officers to Hughli, and he sent also by the
sea-route wd Chittagong another company of troops on a fleet of vessels
from the Imperial Nawarah or Fleet stationed in Dacca, so that the
Portuguese mght not escape by water, giving out at the aame time
that the expedition had as its objective Hijlt. These besieged Hughli,
and, after the fighting was protracted to three months and a half,
succeeded in storming it, and in expelling the Ohristian (Portuguese) traders
from it. 2,000 Christians were killed in the fighting, 4,400 were taken
prisoners, and 10,000 Indian captives that were in the hands of the Portugnese
were released, and 1,000 Musalman soldiers got killed in the fighting. Three
days after this victory (in 1041 A.H.)Qisim Khin died of diseaso. He built the
Cathedral Mosque at Agra in Angah Khan bazaar, (See p. 78, Vol. 8, Maasn-

Mangab and the office o& Imperial Khansaman, Inthe 15th year of Jahangir’s
reign, he was appointed Sibadar ( Governor) of Kashmir and next Mir Bakhghi

Jahin raised him to the rank of 4 anghazari, and also to the office of visier of
the Supreme Diwan. In the second year of Shah Jahin’s reign, he was set to

duties of a Governor, the work of administration fell into confu-
sion. The Assamese, making an incursion, invaded and ravaged
many of the pargannahs within the Imperial domains, and along
with much riches and effects captured and carried away ‘Abdus
Salam,' who had gone on an expedition to Gauhati wath 1,000
Cavalry and numerous infantry. When this news reached the
Emperor, the latter superseded ‘Azam Khan, and appointed Islim
Khan, who had much experience in the work of administration
and was one of the principal ‘Omara of Jahangir, to the office of
Sitbadar of Bengal.

RULE OF NAWAB ISLAM KHAN.

When Nawab Islim Khan was appointed Sibadar of Bengal,
as he was an experienced and a sagacions ruler, on his arrival in

did not satisfy the Emperor, who sent him to Bengal as Viceroy, in succession
+o Qasim Khin, who died in the 5th year of Shah Jahin’s reign. He continu-
ed in Bengal as Viceroy for three years only, and in the 8th year was trans-
ferred to Allahabad, and subsequently fo Gujrat, and lastly to Jaunpur, where
he was Rector of the Jaunpur University, and died in 1059 A.H., in his 76th
year, and was buried in a garden which he had laid out on the banks of the
Jaunpur river. His danghter was married to Prince Shah Shuja (after
the latter had lost his first wife,a daughter of Mirza Rustam Safavi). He
possessed many good qualities, and was very strict in auditing the accounts
of ’Amils (Collectors of Revenue). (See Maastr-ui-Umara, p. 174, Vol. 1).
1 This ‘Abdus Salam would seem to be the Abdus Salam (son of Muazzam
Khan, Sibadar of Delhi) who opportunely reinforced Shujait Khin at the
decisive battle neur Dhaka (Dacca) with the Afghan leader Osman Lohani.
He would seem, therefore, to have bean a brother of Mukkaram Khan (an-
other son of Muazgam Khan) who was Governor of Bengal and who was con-
queror of Kuch Hajo (or Kuch Behar) anf Khurdah. ‘Abdus Salam at the
time would seam to have been Governor of Kuch Hajo, in succession to his
brother Mukkaram Khan, and to have invaded Assam. (See n. ante).
The Alamgirnamah (p. 680, Fasc. VII, Pers. text) calls him ‘Shaikh
Abdus Salam,” and states that towards the early part of Shih Jahin’s reign,
he was ‘Faujdar’ of ‘ Hajo’ (that is, Kuch Hajo, or western part of Kuch
Behar), and that at Gauhati he together with many others was captured by
the Assamese, and that, to chastise the Assamese, an expedition to Assam
was shortly after (during the Viceroyalty of Islim Khan II ahas Mir Abdus
Salam) sent out under command of Siadat Khin (Islam Khiin’s brother), but
that the expedition reached only Kajal (which is on the frontier of Assam),
and did not result in any decisive issue, as Islam Khan was shortly after
recalled by the Emperor to assume the office of Imperial Vizser at Delhi.

the Sibah, he vigerously set himself tu the work of administra-
tion. He organised‘a punitive expedition against the refractory
Assamese, ‘and also planned to conquer Kuch Behar and Assam,
Marching towards those tracts and fighting many battles, he
chastised those wicked tribes, recovered the Imperial mahals which
had been over-run by the latter, and marched against Kuch Behar.
After much fightings, he stormed numerous forts, and then extir-
pated the refractory Assamese. At this juncture, Islam Khan! was
recalled by Shah Jahn, for the purpose of being installed in the
office of Vazir. And order was sent-to Nawab Saif Khin® to the

1 Islim Khan Maghadiz; his actual name was Mir Abdus Salim, and his
titles ‘were “Ikhtisig Khan” and subsequently “Islim Khan’ He should
not be confounded with “ Isl8m Khan Chishti Farugqi,” whose real name was
Shaikh ’Alau-d-din, and who was Viceroy of Bengal, under Emperor Jahangir.

Mir Abdus Salim was in the beginning a Munshi or Secretary of Prince
Shah Jahin. In 1080 A.H. (darmg Jahangir’s reign), he was Vakil-t-Darbar
or Prince Shah Jnxhin’s Political Agent at the Imperial Court (Shih Jahan
being engaged at the time in affairs connected with the Dakhin), and at the
same time received the title of ‘“Ikhtisis Khan.” When dissenmons broke
out between Shah Jahin and Hmperor Jahangir, Mir Abdus Salim joined
Shah Jahin On Shih Jahan’s accession to the throne, he raised Mir Abdus
Salim to the rank of Chahdihazdr?, bestowed on him the title of “Islam
Khin,” and appointed him Bakhshi and subsequently Governor of Gnjrat,
with command of Five Thousand. In the 8th year, on the recall of A’zam

Khan (the Bengal Viceroy), Mir Abdua Salim alas Islim Khan Mashadi was
appointed Viceroy of Bengal In the 11th year of Shih Jahan's accession,
he achieved several notable triumphs, vss., (1) the chastisement of the
Assamese, (2) capture of the son-in-law of the Assam Rajah, (8) capture of
fifteen Assam forts, (4) capture of Srighat and Mando, (5) successful establsh-
ment of Imperial military out-posts or Zhanas inall the mahals of Koch Hajo
(the western portion of Kuch Behar), (6) capture of 500 Koch war-vessels.
Manik Rai, brother of the Rajah of Arrakan, also at this time came to Dhaka
(Dacca) and took refuge with Ielam Khin. In the 18th year (in the text, cor-
rectly, Lith yeur), Islam Khan was called back by Shih Jabin from Bengal,
and installed in the office of Imperial Yaar, He was subsequently appointed
Viceroy of the Dakhin, where he died at Aurangabad m the 21st year of Shah
Johan’ Sxreign, in 1057 AH. He was buried in a mangoleam at Aurangabad,
He was a learned scholar, a brave general and a sagacious administrator. (See
Maasir-ul-Umara, p. 162, Vol. I).

3 Saif Khan Mirza Safi was a son of AmanatKhin, He married Malikah
Bani, sister of Empress Mamiaz Mahal, and a danghter of Asif Khan Eminu-
d-danieb, and-was thus closely conneoted with Emperor Shih Jaban, by mar-
mage. He first became Diwin of the Sibah of Gujrat, and for his victory
over "Abdullah Khan onder daring circumstances, was appointed Sibadar of

effect that the Nizamat of Bengal was assigned to Prince Muham-
mad Shu/j‘a, and that until the latter’s arrival, he should, as Prince’s
Deputy, carry on the work of Bengal administration. As Islim
Khan, in the very midst of fighting, had to march back to the
Imperial presence, the work of Assam conquest was left incomplete,
and his departure wasa signal for fresh disturbances amongst
the Assamese. This happened towards the end of the llth year
of Shah Jahan’s reign.

RULE OF PRINCE MUHAMMAD SHUJ‘A.

In the 12th year of Shah Jahan’s reign, Prince Muhammaa
Shuj‘a! arrived in Bengal, and made Akbarnagar or Rajmahal the

Gauijrat, and also received the title of “Saif Khan.’ He was subsequently
appointed by Emperor Shah Jahan to be Governor of Behar (where at Patna
he built several lofty public edifices), ([Safiabid town, near Jamalpir in
Monghyr, I guess, was built by him, and 1s named so after him. There ig
still a place in it called “ Safi Sarai” or “Safi’sinn.” If my meniory serves
‘me aright, I found a big well wn Monghyr town near the Olab, which bears
af inscription to show that it was built by Saif Khin]. In the 5th year of
eth Jahin’s reign, he became Governor of Allahabad; in the 8th year, he
was selected as Governor of Gujrat, and next appointed Commandant of
Agra. In the 12th year, when Islim Khin Mashadi was summoned back
from Bengal to Delhi, to assume charge of the portfolio of Imperial Vazarat,
Bengal was assigned to Prince Shih Shuj‘s. As tHe Prince wag at the time
away at Kabil, Saif Khan received orders to admimster Bengal on behalf of
the Prince, during his absence. In the 18th year of Shah Jahin’s reign (in
1049 A H.) Saif Khan Mirza, Safi died m Bengal, and his wife Malkah Bini
died the following year. (See Maasw-ul-Umara, p. 416, Vol II).

1 Prince Shih Shuj‘a was the second son of Hmperor Shah Jahan, whose
ot v song were (1) Dara Shekoh, (2) Aurangzeb, and (3) Murad. Shah Shuj‘a
wa. married to a daughter of Mirza Rustam Safavi, and subsequently (on the
death of his firs. wife) to a daughter of Nawab ‘Azam Khar. (a former Bengal
Viceroy). Shih Shuj‘a, on appointment to Bengal, temporarily removed the
Viceregal Capital from Dacca to Rajmahal, He twice ruled over Bengal,
that is, once for eight years, and again (aftor a break of two years) for
another eight years. Shab Shuj‘a’s rule over Bengal was marked by the intro-
daction of financial refortas and by the growth of revenue, “ About 1658
A.O, he prepared a new rent-roll of Bengal, which showed 34 Sarkars and
1,350 mahals, and a total revenue on Khalsa and Jagir lands of Ry 13,215,907
exclusive of abwabs.” (See Blochmann’s Contr, to history of Bengal nud the
Padghahnameh). §hah Shnj‘a was a lover of architectare, and he built
numeraus marble edifices in Rajmehal, Monghyr and Dacca, He also

seat of his Government, and adorned it with grand and hand-
some edifices. The Prince deputed to Jahangirnagar or Dacca, his
Deputy and father-in-law, Nawab ‘Azam Khin.' The affairs of
administration which had fallen into confusion by the departure
of Islim Khan, received now fresh eclat. For a period of eight
years, the Prince devoted himself to the work of administra-
tion. In the 20th year* of Shah Jahin’s reign, the Prince was
recalled to the Imperial presence, and Nawab ‘Itaqiéd Khan was
appointed to the Nizamat of the Sibah of this country.

NIZAMAT OF NAWAB ‘ITAQAD KHAN.

When Nawab ‘Itaqid Khan ® being appointed to the Nizamat
of Bengal arrived in this country, he ruled over Bengal for two

Behar (see Alamgiwrnamah), but shortly after he received a cheok in his
onward career by coming in collision with his clever brother, Aurangzeb, and
at length fed to Arrakan where he perished.

Professer Blochmann’s list (p. 511, Ain, Tr., Vol.1), does not give his name,
In the 17th yeur of Jahangir’s reign, he was appointed Governor of Kashmir, ,

Jahangir toa command of five thousand. In the 5th year of Shah Jahan’s

despatched an.expeditionto Palaun (Palamow) under Zabardast Khan, and
defeated its zemmdar or Rajah, named Partab, who submitted to the
Emperor, and agreed to pay an annual tribute of one lac of rupees. In the
20th year of Shah Jahan’s reign, when Prmce Shih Shuj‘a was recalied
from Bengal, ‘Itaqid Khin m addition to his Governorship of Behar was
appointed Viceroy of Bengal, where he continned for two years. In the 28rd

a man, of great refinement and culture, ard his aesthetic tastes led him to
be one.of the founders of a new and elegant style of architecture. He built
a splendid palace on a new and improved design ab Agra.

AN ACCOUNT OF THE RULE OF SHAH SHUS‘A, FOR THE
SECOND TIME, AND THE END OF HIS CAREER.

When, for the second time, Prince Muhammad Shuj‘a arrived
in Bengal, for eight years more he carried on vigorously the work
of administration, and conquering other tracts added laurels to
himself. In the 30th year of the Emperor’s accession, corres-
ponding to 1067 A.H., Emperor Shah Jahin fell ill. As
the period of illness become protracted,! and the Members of

1 Hmperor Shah Jaliin fell ill at Delhi on ‘7th Zil-haj 1087 A.H. (Alam.
girnamah, p 27). At the time of the Emperor’s illness, Prince Dara Shekoh,
the eldest son, was at Agra, Prince Shuj‘a, the second son, was in Bengal;
Aurangzeb, the third son, was in the Dakhin ; whilst Prince Murad, the fourth
gon, was in Gujrat. Owing to illness, Shih Jahan was invisible to the public
as well as to his ministers and officers, and great confusion in State affairs
occurred, and Dara Shekoh went tothe Emperor, and took into his hands
the rems of Government In order to make himself thoroughly master of the
situation, Dara Shekoh aimed to keep the Emperor fully under his control,
and so forcibly removed the Emperor together with all royal treasures from
Delhi on 20th Maharram, 1068 A H. (1086 in the printed Pers. text ia a mis-
print) to Agra, which was reached on 19th Safar, 1068 A.H. In the mean-
time, Murad proclaimed himself King in Gujrat, whilst Shuj‘a similarly
proclaimed himself King in Bengal, and invaded Patna and Benares
(Alamgsrnamah, p. 29).

Dara Shekoh’s plan was first to vanquish Shah Shuj‘a, next Murad, aad
to reserve the final blow for Aurangzeb, whom he dreaded most. In
pursuance of this scheme, he first detached a large army under the command
of his son Sulaiman Shekoh together with Rajah Jai Singh to operate against
Shah Shuj‘a. The army under Sulaiman Shekoh on the 4th Rabi-al-Awwal
1068 A.H, reached Bahadorpnr, a village on the banks of the Ganges, 2} kos
from Benares, and 1} kos from Shah Shuj‘a’s encampment §hzh Shnij‘a had
brought with him a large number of Nawarah or war-ships from Bengal, and
#O waS sanguine of success, and treating the foe with contempt, he had dis-
pensed with all ordinary precantions of war. Sulaiman Shekoh madea femt
retreat which further took in Shih Shnj‘a, and then suddenly wheeling round,
made a bold dash which completely surprised Shah Shuj‘a, who leaving behind
his tents, treasures, guns and horses, hastily got into a boat, and sailed down
to Patna, thence to Monghyr, where he halted for some days. Sulaiman
Shekoh’s army pursued Shuj‘a fo Monghyr; and, then the latter quitting

216

Government could not obtain audience with the Emperor, great
confusion ensued in the affairs of the Empire Since amongst the

Monghyr, set ont for Bengal. (See Alamgunamgh, p. 31). Whilst these
events were transpiring in Bengal, Aurangzeb with his marvellons insight
grasping the situation forestalled Dara Shekoh by making a move from
Aurangabad towards Burhanpur on Friday, 12th Jamadi-ul-Awwal 1068 A H,
(Alamgunamah, p. 48). After halting for a month at Burhanpnr to get
news of the state of things at Agra, Aurangzeb learnt that Dara Shekoh had
detached a large army under Rajah Jaswant Singh, who had already arrived
at Ujjain, in Malwah. This made Aurangzeb deade his plans. He imme.
diately on 25th Jamadi-al-Akhirah on a Saturday marched from Burhanpur,
reached the banks of the Narbadda, crossed 16, and on the 20th Rajab
encamped at Dibalpur. On the 21st Rajab, setting out from Dibalpur, he
met on the way Prince Murad, and won him over to his side (Alamgyrnamah,
p. 55), and reached Dharmatpur, a place 7 kos from Ujjain, and
one kos from Rajah Jaswant Singh’s army, and pitched his camp on the
banks of a iivulet, called Obiir Narainah. (Alamgirnamah, p. 66).
Rajah Jaswant Singh was quite ont-witted by this strategic move of
Aurangzeb who had united his forces with those of Murad. Aurangzeb then
inflicted a crashmg blow on Rajab Jaswant Smgh at Dharmatpur. (See
charming description of this battle in the Alamgurnamah, Pers text, pp 61,
66 to 74). Marching quickly from Dharmatpur, Aurangzeb passed through
Gwalior. In the meantime Dara Shakoh had marched to Dholpur (p. 85,
Alamgwnamah), to oppose Aurangzeb’s progress, and to prevent his crossing
the Chanbal mver. Anrangzeb quickly however crossed the Chanbal river at
the ferry of Bbhadureah, which is 20 kos from Dholpur, on the first day of the
month of Ramzan On the 7th Ramzan, the battle of Dholpar was fonght,
and Dara Shekoh was completely defeated by Aurangzeb. (See description
of the battle of Dholpur in the Alamgwnamah, pp 100 to 104). Dara Shekoh
fled to Agra, and thence to the Panjab and other places, was eventually
captared and beheaded, Shortly after his installation, Aurangzeb drew his
force against Shih Shuj‘a who had advanced, and occupied Rohtas, Chunar,
Jaunpur, Benares and Allahabad. The battle between Aurangzeb and Shuj‘a
was fought at Kachwa, a place close to Korah, and resulted in Shuj‘a’s defeat.
{See desemption of the battle in the Alamgyrnamah, Peis text, p. 243). After
lng defeat, Shuj‘a fled to Bahadurpur, thence to Patna, thence to Monghyr
which he fortified, and thence (owing to the treachery of Rajah Bahroz,
gammndur of Kharakpur) to Rangamati, and thence (owing to treachery of
Khwajah Kamalu-d-din, zamindar of Birbhum) to Rajmahal, thence through
minor places to Dacca, thence through Bhaluah and mmor places to Arrakan,
always heroically contesting every inch of ground against the hosts of
Aurangzeb, led by his General Muazzam Khan alias Mir Jomla, but every
time baffled by the treachery of so-called adherents, barring a noble band of
Barha Syeds who clung to him to the last. (See pp. 495 to 561, Alamgirnamah,
Pers. text}.

217

Princes Royal, no one except Dura Shekoh was near the Emperor,
the reins of Imperial administration were assigned to him. Dara
Shekoh, viewing himself to be the Orown-Prince, fully grasped
the threads of Imperial administration. Owing to this, Prince
Murad Baksh in Gujrat had the Khutbah read after his own name,
whilst in Bengal, Muhammad Shuy‘a proclaimed himself King, and
marshalling his forces, marched towards Patna and Behar, and
advancing thence, reached the environs of Benares. On hearing
this news, Dara Shekoh, during the serious illness of the Emperor,
marched with the latter from Shahjahanabad ( Delhi), to Akbara-
bad (Agra), on the 20th Muharram, 1068, A H corresponding to
the 31st year of the Emperor's accession, and on the 19th Safar,
reached Akbarabad (Agra), From this place, Dara Shekok
detached Raja Jai Singh Kaoboah, who was a leading Rajah and
a principal member of the Empire, together with other leading
noblemen, such as Diler Khan, Salabat Khan and Izad Singh, and
other officers holding the ranks of Panjhazari and Chahurkazaré,
besides a large army composed of his own and the Imperial
troops, along with guns and armaments, under the general scom-
mand of Sulaiman Shekoh, bis eldest son, in order to fight against
Muhammad Shuj‘a Accordingly, these marched from Agra on the
4th of the month of Rabiul-Awwal of the aforesaid year, and set
out on the aforesaid expedition. And after marching several
stages, and passing through the city of Benaies, these encamped at
the village of Bahadurpur (which, 1s situated on the bank of the
Ganges at a distance of two and a half kroh from the city of
Benares) to a distance of one and a half krokh from Muhammad
Shuj‘a’s army. Both the armies exhibited mulitary stategy and
tactics, and sought for an opportunity to surprise the other. In
consequence neither side madeasally. On the 21st Jamadiul-.
Awwal, the Imperialists made a feint as if to shift their camp, but
suddenly wheeled round, and rushed Shuj‘a’s army, which was
completely taken by surprise On hearing the news of the feint
retreat of the Imperialists on the previous day, Shuj‘a had
neglected his war-preparations, and was fastasleep. Bemg thus
taken by surprise, he woke up from his slumber, and mounting a
female elephant, he moved about restlessly, But the game was
alieady up, especially as Raja Jai Singh making a dashing flank
movement from the left side, closed in upou him, Seeing no alter.
native, Shih Shuj‘a got into his war-vessels which he had brought

up from Bengal, and sailed down swiftly, abondoning his treasures,
guna, horses, baggages and tents. Sailing swiftly down Patna,
he reached Mungir, and prepared to fortify it, and halted there
for some days. Sulaiman Shekoh’s army, after plundering and
ravaging and slaughtering and capturing, followed up Muhammad
Shuj‘a, and reached Mungir. Muhammad Shuj‘a, finding it impos-
sible to stand his ground there, fled with the swiftness of light.
ning and air, and entered Akbarnagar (Rajymahal). The Imperial
army reduced to subjection the Subah of Patna and Behar.t Butin
the meantime, Aurangzeb had marched from the Dakhin * towards
the Imperial Presence, and on the outskirts of the Narbadda had
fought an engagement with a numerons horde of Imperialists, and
after sanguinary fightings had inflicted a signal defeat, and had
marched to Shahjahanabad, and entered the Capital. Deputing
his eldest son, Sultin Muhammad, to be near the Emperor,
Aurangzeb put the latter under surveillance, and killed Dara
Shekoh® after much warfare, and in the loly month of Ramzan
1069 A.H ascended the Imperial throne of Delhi. Sulaiman
Shekoh, on hearmg the news of Dara Shekoh’s defeat, gave up the
‘pursuit of Shah Shnj‘a, and retreated towards Shahjahinabad
(Delhi), Muhammad Shuj‘a fancying that the straggle between
Dara Shekoh and Aurangzeb would be a protracted one, thought
his opportunity had come, and by the bad advice of AJivardi Khin
and Mirza Jan Beg and other members of his Government,

1 The Alamgirnamah, p. 81 (from which the account here in the text
appears to be borrowed) siys “From Monghyr to Patna became annexed to
the Satrapy (1q/@) of Dara Shekoh.”

& Aurangzeb moved from the Dakhin in 1068 A.H., inflicted a crushing
defeat on Dara Shekoh’s troops led by Maharaja Jaswant Singh at Ujjain, and
also defeated Dara Shekoh near Agra, and then informally proclaimed himself
Emperor in 1060 A. = (See Alamgwnamah, pp 59 to 86, and pp. 87 to 108).

3 Dara Shekoh, after his defeat by Aurangzeb near Agra, fled to Delhi,
and thence to Lahore, and after varions adventures in the Panjab, Gujrat
and Kabul was captured by Jiwan, zamindar of Dadar, and made over to
Anrangzeb who eaused him to be imprisoned and subsequently slain, and his
body buried in the mausoleum of Humayun at Delhi. (See Alamgurnamah,
pp, 438 and 408). Those who take an interest in Dara Ghekoh’s adventures
after his flight, will finda full accoant of the same in the Alamgtrnamah.
Dara §hekoh was o free-thinker and a pro-Hindn, and if he had succeeded to
the throne, he would have ont-Akbared Akbar in\his pro-Himdu poly.
Aurangzeb was the reverse of Dara Shekoh ; he was a champion of Islam, and

refurbishing his sword, laid claim as his heriiage to the suzerainty
of Bengal, and with a large and formidable army marched towards
the Capitalof Hindustan. As before Shuj‘a’s arrival, the struggle
in Hindustan between Aurangzeb and Dara Shekoh had terminated,
and Aurangzeb had already mounted the Imperial throne, on hear-
ing this news cf Shuj‘a’s march, Aurangzeb with his entire army
of Hindustan swiftly marched, and at Kachwah the two armies
encountered each other, and a battle was fought.

The armies were arrayed on both sides,

They stood forth like mountains on a plain.

When the armies from both sides approached each other,

From the dark dust that arose, the universe turned dark.

When from both sides they struck up drums of war,

The lion-hke heroes spread their claws to smite.

Tumult arose from drums,

The ear of the world was deafened

From guns and muskets, rockets and arrows,

Security in the world fled to a corner.

From the smoke of gun-wagons that mingled with the
atmosphere,

The sky became hidden from tne world’s view.

The spear warmed in slaughtering,

And whispered messages of destruction into the ear of Life.

The lightning of the sword kindled fire so much,

That it burnt the harvest of existence,

The fire of warfare blazed up so keenly,

That it scorched the heart of Mars aloft on the sky.

After much exertions and fightings, Aurangzeb’s army was
defeated. Aurangzeb, however, with a number of noblemen and
some gunners, stood his ground on the battle-fteld Alivardi Khan,
the generalissimo of Shah Shuj‘a’s force, attempted to capture
Aurangzeb and checkmate him. As God has bestowed greater
wisdom on Sovereigns than on the mass of mankind, and as in
military affairs, Sovereigns are endowed with a more accurate per-
ception of the situation, that wise sovereign (Aurangzeb) observing
the adage that “war is fraud,” deceived the aforesaid Khan by
holding out to him the chance of being appointed Prime Minister,
and said that if the latter could induce Muhammad Shuj‘a to


--- Page 247 ---
220

dismount from his elephant and to mount a horse, he would win
this game The aforsesaid Khan, seduced by the bait held out by
Aurangzeb, played false with his own old benefactor, and spoke
to Muhammad Shuj‘a as follows: “Victory has been already
achieved by our army, and the enemy’s force has been defeated,
As cannon-balls, and rockets and arrows are raining from every
side, it is possible that the Royal elephant might be hit ; it is
therefore advisable that your Highness should dismount from your
elephant and mount a horse. By the good luck of your Highness,
I would immediately capture and fetch ‘Alamgir” Instantly as
Shah Shuj‘a mounted a horse, the aforesaid Khan sent informa-
tion to ‘Alamgir. ‘Alamgir immediately adopted the ruse of
causing the music of victory to be struck up And since the army
did not find Shab Shuj‘a on the elephant, news spread in the
army about the victory of ‘Alamgir and the defeat of Shah Shuj‘a.
Shuj‘a’s force fled panic-stricken, thinking that Shuj‘a had been
killed, Although Shuj‘a made exertions to stop the panic and
prevent the flight, these were in vain Hence the adage is
“Shuj‘a lost a winning game.” The army of Aurangzeb collect-
img together, made an onslaught. When Shah Shuy‘a found that
he had lost the game, he was obliged to take to flight, and fled
to Bengal, and fortifying the passer of Teliagadhi and Sakrigali,
he entrenched himself at Akbarnagar (Rajmahal), ‘Alamgir
appointed Nawab Ma‘azzam Khan, Khan-i-Khanan, the Generalis-
simo, to be Subadar or Viceroy of Bengal. And detaching
twenty-two renowned noblemen, lke Nawab Islam Khan, Diler
Ehan, Daiid Khan, Fateh Jang Khan, and Ihtisham Kh&n, eto.
under the command of Sultan Muhammad, to pnrsue Shih Shnj‘a,
Aurangzeb himself triumphant und victorious marched back to-
wards the Capital (Delhi).

When Nawab Mu‘azzam Khin was appointed Subadar of
Bengal, he marched towards Bengal with a large army. As
the passes of Teliagadhi and Sakrigali had been fortified by Shah
Shuj‘a, viewing the forcing of those defiles to be a difficult opera-
tion, with twelve thousand soldiers he swiftly marched to Bengal

by way of Jharkand! and the mountains When the contending
armies approached each other, Shah Shuj‘a finding it impracticable
to tarry at Akbainagar (Rajmahal) caused ‘Alivardi Khan, who
was the root of allthis mischief, to be slain, himself retired to
Tandah, and erecting redoubts, fortified himself there. When the
two forces approached each other, separated by the river Ganges,
one day Sharif Khan, who was a source of mischief, and Fateh
Jang Khan, gettmg into boats, crossed over to the northern bank,
and they were similarly followed by others. From the northern
side of the bank, as soon as Sharif Khan landed, the soldiers of
Shah Shuj‘a gave battle. Nearly seventy persons who had reached
the banks were killed and slaughtered. The remaining boats retired
from the middle of the river. Sultan Shuj‘a ordered the wounded
persons to be killed ; but Shah Neamatullah Firuzpuri expostulat-
ed. Sh&h Shuj‘a who had great faith in this Saint made over to
the latter Sharif Khan together with other wounded prisoners.
The Saint nursed them, and after their wounds had healed up
sent them back to theirarmy. But Sultan Muhammad, desiring to
desert to his uncle, came alone to meet the latter, and receiving
much kindaoess from his uncle, stayed on with him. Sultan Shuj‘a
gave his daughter in marriage to him. Sultén Muhammad, on
the side of Sultan Shuj‘a, fought several battles with the Imperial-
ists, consisting of the Khan-i-Khanan® and Diler Khan, &e.

1 The Alamgirnamah indicates that at the time Shah Shuj‘a had halted
at Monghyr, fortifying the place Then Rajah Bahroz, zamindar or Rajah of
Kharakpar, who professed loyalty to Shah Shuj‘a, but in reality was a traitor
secretly intrigued with Aurangzeb’s general, Mir Jumle alias Mu‘azzam Khan,
and showed the latter another route across the hills to the east of Monghyr,
In covering this route, Mir Jumla had to make a detour of several mies; and
Shah Shoj‘a finding that he was being out-flanked, instantly sailed down on
his war-veasels from Monghyr Fort to Rangamati and Rajymahal, and on the
way fortified the passes of Teliagadhi and Sakrigali, which were then regard-
ed as the ‘key’ to Bengal.

p. 580, Pers. text.

From it, it appears that his name was Mir Muhammed Said Mir Jomle,
and his titles were “ Mn‘azzam Khin, Khin-i-Khanan Sipasalar” He came
from Ardastan, first served under Sulfin Abdullah Qutb Shah, ruler of
Golkondah, where he attained great eminence. Fallug out with Qutb §hih,
he joined Prince Aurangzeb who was then in the Dikhin. His great services
were (1) the conquest of Bijapur, (2) the extirpation of Shih Shnj‘s, (8) the
conquests of Kuch Behar and Assam. He was a statesman of great sagncity

At length, on finding Sultan Shuj‘a negligent and apathetic,
Saltaén Muhammad went over again to the side of the Im perialisis,
and from thence to the presence of Emperor Aurangzeb at Shah
Jahanabad, where he was imprisoned.! And orders were repeated
to the Khan-i-Khanan to pursue Sultan Shuj‘ a. In short, one day
jwhen Diler Khan, &c., crossed the river at Paglaghat, Diler
Than’s son, with a number of efficient men, was drowned. Sultan
Shuj‘a with his dependants and adherents, getting into war-
vessels which had been brought up from Jahangirnagar (Dacea),
set out for the latter place. The Khan-i-Khanan® also followed him
up by land. Finding it impossible to make a stand ai this place
either, Sultin Shuj‘a with a number of followers took the road to
Assam, and from thence proceeded to Arrakem, and took shelter
with the ruler of that tract, whu was a Sy#0,9 and ina short
time he died there, either owing to the trgachery of the ruler of
that tract, or from natural disease. When in the period of
anarchy under Sultan Shuj‘a, Bhim Narain, Rajah of Kuch
Behar,’ becoming daring, with a large force attacked Ghoraghat,

and foresight, and ag a general, he was matchless in his day. (See Maastr-ul-
Umara, p. 555, Vol III, Pers, text)

1 Details of Sulfin Muhammad’s desertion to Shih Ghuj‘a, and his
subsequent secession, are given in the Alamgurnamah.

& Details of Shih Shuyj‘a’s fightings and adventures are given in the
Alamgirnamah See notes, ante.

8 The description in the Alamgirnamah, pp. 687 to 562, shows that the
ruler of Arrakan was neither a Syed nor a Mussulman, but a Buddhist. Italso
appears from the Alumgwnamah that setting ont from Tandah on boats,
Sulsan Shuj‘a reached Dacea (Jahangirnagar) where his eldest son Zainu-d-
din had been from before. Zainu-d-din had arranged’ with the Rajah of
Arrnkan to escort Sultan Shuj‘a to Arrakan, on the latter’s arrival at Dacoa,
At this time, Maniar Khan, a zamindar of Jahangirnegar, proved obstructive
to Zainu-d-din’s plans, and so he (Maniiar) was first chastised with the help
of the Arrakanese. Starting from Dacca on boats, guarded by the Arrakanese,
Shuj‘a passed through Dhapa (4 kos from Dacoa), Siripur (12 kos north of
Dacca), BLaluah (which then formed the southern hmit of the Mughal
dominions in Bengal), and thence to Arrakan. One who cares to note names
of old Bengal towns, may profitably read this portion of the Alamgiwnamah,

4 In the Alamgirnamah (p 676), he is called ‘Bim Nara, zamindar of
Kuch Behar.” It is stated therein that hitherto he used to regularly pay
tribute to the Emperor, but that during the chaos which arose owing to
Emperor Shih Jahin’s illness, and owing to Shih Shny‘a march to Patna,
in order to lay claim to the Imperial throne, Bim Narain ceased paying
tribate, and invaded Ghoraghat or Rangpur and subsequently Kamrup.

he captured a large number of the Musalman residents, male and
female, of that place, and with the object of conquering Kamrup,
to which Province pertained the tracts of Hajo and Gauhati,
and which was included in the Imperial domains, he despatched
his minster named Sahuavath ! with a large force. On the news
of this invasion, the Rajah of Assam® shewing short-sightedness
sent also a large force by land and water towards Kamrup.,
Mw Lutfullah Ghivazi, who was Faujdar of the Province of
Kamrup,$ seeing from both sides torrents of invasion overtaking
him, aud despaivmy of rehef, and being ce: tam about the absence
of Imperial auxiliaries, quickly got into a boat, and reached
Jahangirnagar or Dacca, and rescued himself from the impending
danger. And Sahuanath, not being able to cope with the
Assamese, acting up to the saying: “To retarn is better,” retired
to his own country. The Assamese, without contest, conquered
the province of Kamrup, swept it with the broom of plunder,
carried by force to their own country all and everything, including
the moveable and immoveable effects of the people, pulled down the
edifices, left no trace of fertility, and reduced the whole
province to one plain, level ground. As Sultan Shuj‘a was ocen-
pied with his own affairs, the infidels of Assam finding an
opportunity conquered the environs of mauza Kadi Bari, which
is five stages from Jahangirnagar, aud placing a garrison at the
village of Tabsilah near Kadibari, raised the standard of daring
andinsurrection. Consequently, when the Khan-i-Khanan reached
Jnhangirnagar, after devoting himself for some time to ad-
ministrative business, he collected war-vessels and artillery and
other armaments, and leaving Ihtisham Khan to protect Jahan-
girnagar (Dacca) and its environs, and appointing Rai Bhogati
Das Shujai to charge of financial and internal affains, in the 4th

time, he subdued the Kingdom of Kuch Behar up to Gauhati.
After this, he pushed on with his forces to conquer Assam. In
the meanwhile, the Emperor’s order came, directing him to
march to Arrakan, in order to rescue the childten and ladies of
the household of Shah Shuj‘a from distress and from imprison-
ment at the hands of the Arrakanese, and to send them up to the
Imperial presence. The Khan in reply to the Imperial order,
represented that the Imperial tyoops were busy in fighting
to conquer the provinces of Kuen Behar and Assam, and that to
march to Arrakan, without accomplishing the conquest of the
aforesaid two provinces, was opposed to expediency, and that
he would postpone the expedition to Arrakan to next year,
and that this year, he would set about subjugating the

Jamadialsani of the aforesaid year, marching from Gauhati, he
entered Assam. Fighting by water and by land, he pushed:
through the jungles, mountains and rivers. And wherever
he went he established a garrison. Storming the citadel and
palace of the Rajah of that country after much fighting, he
gained much booty. After successive battles,! the hapless
Assammese, being routed, fled and escaped to the hills of
Bhutan, and the whole of Assam was conquered. At length,
the Rajah of Assam drawing the rein of submission to the neck,
and wearing the ring of abedience on the ear, deputed a trust-
worthy envoy to wait on the Khan-i-Khanan with gifts and
presents, and agreed topay tribute to the Emperor, and also
sent his own daughter with goods, rare silk-stuffs, elephants:
and other rarities in charge of Badli Phukan, for Emperor
Aurangzeb. The aforesaid Phukan, with all the presents, reach-
ing the outskirts of the city of Dacca, encamped and prepared

Assamese is well known, the Khan-i-Khanau was affected by their
sorcery. For some time he was laid up with pains on the hver
and heart, daily these increased, and poimted to a fatal termina-
tion, Although he got himself treated, no beneficial effect was
perceptible. Ho was, therefore, obhged to leave behind Mir
Murtaza and other commanders Leavyitg garrisons at every
strategic point, he proceeded to a hill, and from thence, owing to
his illness increasing, he set out! on a barge for Jahangirnagar

of the month of Ramzan 1073 A.H, corresponding to the 5th
year of Emperor Aurangzeb’s accession, he died on board the
vessel,? Subsequently, the garrisons of the outposts evacuated
their outlymg posts, but the Rajah’s daughter stayed behind
with the tribute, as the Rajah refused to take her back into his
household.

VICEROYALTY OF NAWAB AMIR-UL-UMARA
SHAISTA KHAN.

After the Khan-i-Khanan’s death, the office of Subadar of
Bengal being conferred on Amir-ul-Umara Shasta Khan, the
latter arrived in Bengal. For some years devoting himself to
administrative work, he administered justice and promoted the
welfare of the people. Bestowing grants of villages and lands on
widows of nobles and others in straitened circumstances, he
made them well-off. Spies informed the Emperor, whereon
Shaista Khan! himself went to the latter and explained the
true state of things. As the alleged dissipation of the Imperial
revenue was unfounded, he was re-invested with the Khellat
of appointment, and sent back to Bengal* Butasthe Khan was

1 Shaigta Khan was a son of Eminn-d-daulah Asaf Khan, and a brother
of Mumtaz Mahal, wife of Shah Jahan. His namo was Mirza Abi TFahb,
and his titles were “ Amur-ul-Umara Shiista Khan ” In the reign of Shah-
jahan, he becamean Panjhazars And Nazim of Balaghat in the Dakhin, and
subsequently Subadar of Behar and Patna, when he invaded Palaon (Palamn)
and subdued Partab, Zaminder of Palaon (Palamu). He then became Suba-
dar of Malwah and Gujrat and subsequently Viceroy of all the Subahs of the
Dakhin. He rendered good services to Aurangzeb in the latter’s fightings with
Dara Shekoh and Sularman Shekoh. On the death of Mir Jumla, he became
Viceroy of Bengal in 1664A.C. He chastised thoroughly the Mag pirates who
harried the coasts of Bengal, and wrested from them (chiefly through the exer-
tions of his own son, Buzurg Umed Khan) the fort of Chittagong, and named it
Islamabad (Alamgunamah, p. 940). He subsequently became a Hafthazari and
Viceroy of Agra, where he died in1105 A H. He was held in hgh esteem by
Emperor Aurangzeb, who lavished on him high privileges and semi-regal
honours. With all his greatness, Shiista Khin was meek and humble, courteous
and affable, just and liberal, brave, noble, and enlightened, He established
mosques with madrassas, rest-houses, bridges, and roads throughout India, and
his charities were wide. He was married to a daughter of Shah Nawaz Khin,
son of Abdur Rahim Khin Khianan. He formsa prominent figure in connection
with the early commercial enterprises of the English Hast India Company.
(See Wilson’s Early Annals of the English wm Bengal, Vol. 1, pp. 48—99 anzs11,
and Hunter’s “ History of British India,” Vol. 2, pp. 288-266), Nawab Shaista
Khin’s Viceroyalty in Sengal forms a brilliant chapter in the Mughal annals
of Bengal, as during it many useful public works, such as serats, bridges, and
roads were constructed, and the economic and agricultural condition of the
people attained an unique degree of prosperity, in that a maund of moe sold
fa the bazar for two annas only (See Maasir-v-Alamgiri, pp. 167 and 368, and

not desirous of staying m this Province, he used constantly
to write letters to the Emperor, requesting permission to kiss
the Royal feat, and begging deputation of some other officer to
assume the office of Subadar of this Province At first his resig-
nation was not accepted; but at length, owing to Shaista Khan's
importunities, the Nizamat was bestowed on Nawab Ibrahim Khan,
a@ son of ‘Alimardan Khan Yar Ofadar. Traces of the beneficent
administration of the Nawab Amir-ul-umara are known not only
in Bengal, but throughout Hindustan, One is this, that during his
Nizamat the cheapness of food-grains was so great that for a
damri, one seer of rice could be purchased in the market. At
the time of his return tu the capital Shahjahanabad (Delhi), he
caused the following inscription to be engraved on the western gate
of Jahangirnagar (Dacca): “ Let him only open this gate that can
shew the selling rate of rice as cheap as this.” From his time on-
ward tili the regimé of Nawab Shujaud-din Muhammad Khan, this
gate remained closed In the period of the Viceroyalty of Nawab
Sarfaraz Khan, the gate was again opened, as will be mentioned
hereafter. The Kuatrah and other buildings of the ‘Amir-ul-umara*
up to this day exist in Jahangirnagar (Dacca).”%

in his 98rd lunar year. For his parwana of pardon to the Boglish in 1687,

1 A dam was equal to the fortieth part of the rupee, and 2 damri was
equal to one-eighth part of a dam (See Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. I, p 81), that
is, 320 damris made up one rupee. Therefore, during Shaista Khin’s
Viceroyalty 1n Bengal, for one rapes 8 maunds of rice could be had, in other
words, the price, per maund, of rica was two annas only.

3 The Maasw-1-Alamgirs (p. 868) is highly eulogistic in praise of Nawab
Shasta Khan. It says that he estabhehed nnamerous caravanserais and
erected numerous bridges throughout India. Hus great achievements in
Bengal were (1) the Conquest of Chittagong which was named by him Islama-
bad (for details see Alamgirnamah, p. 940); (2) the extirpation of the Mag
pirates; (3) the rmprovement of the economic and agricultural condition of
Bengal; and (4} construction of numerous ugeful public works, (See also
Maasir-ul-umara, p. 680, Vol. II). During his Viceroyalty, Duldan Namjal,
Rajah of Tibat (through the exertions of Saf Khan Sibadar of Kashmir,
Murad Khin, zamindar of ‘fibat-i-Khurd, and Muhammad Shafi envoy)
submitted to Aurangzeb (pp. 921-922, Alamguwnamah).

royalty of Nawab Shaista Khan should have omitted all mention of the
Nawah’s greatest militury achievements in Bengal, vw., the chastisement of

VICEROYALTY OF NAWAB IBRAHIM KHAN!

Nawab Ibrahim Khin on being invested with the Khillat of
the Nigimat of the Subah of Bengal, arrived at Jahangirnagar

the Mag and Portuguese pirates and the re-conquest of Chittagong. I thera-
fore translate freely the following contemporary account from the Alamgir-
numah (Pers. text, p 948) —

Asthe Mags emerging from Arrakan on war-vessels (Nawarah) and
taking advantage of the struggle for supremacy hetween Anrangzeb and Shah
Shuj‘a, harried the coasts of Bengal, Emperor Aurangzeb sent out orders
to his Bengal Viceroy, Nawab Shaista Khan, to tnke immediate steps for
chastising the Mags, With this object in view, Nawab Shasta Khan first
took steps to guard and fortify his southern frontier ont-posts He appoint-
ed an Afghan named Said with 500 rocketeers and musketeers to charge of the
Noakhali ont-post, Muhammad Sharif, Faujdar of Hughli, with 500 rocketeers,
1,000 infantry and 20 guns to defend the out-post of Sankram-Kadah,
and set Muhammad Beg Abakash and Abil Hassan with the Imperial
war-vessels which lay at Siripir to patrol the river. From Siripir to
*Alamgirnagar covering 4 distance of twenty-one hrohk, an embanked road so
that it might not be flooded during the rains was also constracted under the
Nawab’s order, for military purposes. The Nawab then ordered Abiil Hassan
to bring round Dilawar, zamindar of Sardip, or to punish him, as the Iatter
secretly sided with the Mags. Abi Hassan attacked Sandip and fought with
Dilawar, who being hit by an arrow fled to the jungles. Meanwhile, the
Arrakanese fleet came up to Sandip to render assistance to Dilawar Abil
Hassan prepared to assault the Arrakanese fleet, which withdrew, and then
Abil Hasan, not pursuing it, retured to Noakhali. Nawab Shaista Khin,
on hearing of this, sent another fleet consisting of 1,500 gunners and 400
cavalry, commanded by Ibn-i-Husain, Superintendent of the Nawarah (Fleet),

1 Torahim Khan was the eidest son of Amir-ul- Umara ‘Ali Mardan Khin.
On his father’s death, he was made a Qhahar hazari, and subsequently a
Panjhasari. He becume Sibadar of Kashmir, of Lahor, of Behar, and of
Bengal in quick succession. Ws sons were Zabardast Khan (who chastised
the rebel Afghan, Rahim Khan) and Yaqiib Khan (who became Sibadar of
Lahor). He was recalled from Bengal in 1109 AH. (in the 41st year of
Aurangzeb’s reign), when Shahzadah Muhammad Azinh, alias ..zimu-sh-Shan,
was appointed in his place. (See Maasir-i-Alamgiri, pp. 71, 168, and 387, and
Maasvr-ul-umara, Vol, 1, p. 295). The Hnglish merchanis styled him “the
most famously just and good nabob” (see Wilson’s Harly Annals of the
English wn Bengal, Vol. I, p. 124), as he allowed them to return from Madras
and finally settle at Sutanuti (future Calontta) in the first year of his
Vaceroyalty (1690), after Emperor Aurangzeb had tuat year granted a
‘general pardon’ to the Buylish merchants, on their making a most humble
submissive petition, and on thew ‘promising to pay a fine of Rs. 150,000?
(See Hunter’s India, Vol. 2, pp. 265-266).

(Dacca) and devoted himself to administrative affairs. He un-
furled to the oppressed the gates of justice and clemency, and did

Jamal Khan, Serandaz Khan, Qaramal Khan and Muhammad Beg, to re-
inforce Abil Hassan, to co-operate with the latter and occupy Sandip
(Sondip), and to extirpate its zamindar, Dilawar. Ibn-i-Husain with this
re-inforcement moved up to Noakhali, which is in front of Sandip, and
halted there with Muhammad Beg, in order to blockade the passage of the
Arrakanese fleet. Abil Hassan with others then attacked Sandip, wounded
and captured Sharif, son of Dilawar, and captured also, after severe fighting,
Dilawar with his followers, and sent them prisoners to Jahangirnagar
(Dacea) in charge of Maniiar, zamindar of Jahangirnagar, and subdued
Sandip Nawab Shaista Khan, on getimg news of the couquest of Sandip,
appointed Abdil Karim, brother of Rashid Khan, to the charge of Sandip,
with 200 cavalry and 1,000 infantry. The Feringis (Portuguese) were at this
time siding with the Arrakanese, so Nawab Shnste Khin first took steps
to detach the Fermgis, and for this purpose sent ont letters to some of the
leading Fenngis Some of these letters falling into the hands of Karam
Kibri, a Mag, who with a fleet was in the environs of Sandip, the latter com-
wmonicated 14 to the Rajah of Arrakan, who lost confidence in the Fermgis,
and ordered that the Feringis should be deported from Chittagong to Arrakan,
The Feringis of Chittagong gettang scent of this set fire to many of the
Arrakanese fleet, and fled to Noakhali in the Mughal dominions. Farhad
Khan, Commandant of Bhaluah ont-post, kept some Feringis with himself,
and sent their leaders to Nawab Shaista Khan to Dacca (Jahangirnagar),
The latter treated them generously. The Nawab then sent ont an expedition

heels, fled to Jahangirnagar (Dacca), which was the Viceregal
capital of Bengal On hearing of this, Naru-l-lah Khan,!
Faujdar? of the Chaklah of Jasar (Jessore), Hugli, Bardwin, and
Meduipur, who was very opulent and had commercial business,
and who also held the dignity of a Sehhazari, marched out from
Jasar§ in order to chastise and subdue the rebels. From the din
of the enemy’s march, considering himself unable tv stand the
onset, he retired to the fort of Hugli, and sought for help
from the Christian Dutch of Qhuchrah (Chinsurah). The enemy,
on getting news of Nurullah’s cowardice, promptly set to besiege
the fort, and after skirmishes reduced the garrison to straits.
And that coward, acting on Shaikh S‘adi’s couplet:

“When you cannot vanquish the enemy by your might,
You ought to close the gate of disturbance, with largesses,”

throwing away his treasures and effects, consideréd it lucky to save
his own hfe. With a nose and two ears, clad in a rag, he came
out of the fort; and the fort of Hugli, together with all his
effects and property fell into the enemy’s hands. From the
occurrence of this disaster there was a universal commotion.
The leading gentry and nobility of the town and suburbs, and
the merchants and residents of the environs, together with
ther effects, tonk refuge in Qhuchrah (Chinsurah), which was a
place of security. The Dutch leaders sailed up to the foot of
the fort with two ships Joaded with soldiers and armaments.
and by a shower of canuon-balls, they battered the buildings
of the fort, and flooded the harvest of numerous lives ‘with the
torrent of destruction. Subha Singh, not arranging terms of
peace, fled to Satgaon, close to Hugli, and there. too, not finding

1b practicable to tarry, retired to Bardwan, and under the lead
of Rahim Khan marched thence with his rabble towards Nadia
and Murshidabad, which was then called Makhgusabad, Amongst
the women and children of the slain Kishan Ram that were
captives in the oppressive grip of Subha Singh, the former's daughter
was adorned with the ornaments of beauty and elegance and of
chastity and modesty. That wretch of a villain (Subha Singh)
plotted to stain the hem of the maiden’s chastity with the filth
of defilement. As fate would have it, that dog of a night wanted to
pounce on that maiden,! and through seduction of Satan, it stretched
out its hand towardsher. That lion-like maiden with the swiftness
of the wink of blouu-shedding eyes, by means of a sharp knife
which she secreted with herself for such an occasion, cut hm up
from below the navel to the belly, and with the same sharp knife
cut asander the thread of her own life. When this world-con-
suming fire was extinguished, another arose in the person of
that villain’s brother, by the name of Himat Singh. The
latter also resolved to set the world on fire, and attempted to
plunder and pillage the Imperial domains. And Rahim Khan,
owing to the strength of his rabble and clan, styled himself
Rebim Shih Placing crookedly on the head of pride the cap
of vanity, and collecting a large number of low .and ignorant
badmashes, he redoubled the flame of insurrection,® sc that from
Bardwan to Akbarnagar (Rajmahal) on the west of the
Ganges, half the Province of Bengal was harried by him. And
whoever amongst the Imperial adherents refused to submit to him
was punished and tortured Amongst them, in the environs of
Murghidabad, there lived an Imperial officer, named Neamat
Khan, with his family and dependants. When he refused to
join Rehim Shah the latter, thirsty for his blood, ordered his
head to be brought. Seeing the measure of his life full to the
brim, Neamat Khan prepared to drink out of the cup of martyr-
dom, and advanced to the field. Tauhar Khan, his nephew, who
was as brave as his name implied, spurring on his charger, made a
brave onset. At length the forces of the enemy hemmed him in,
and from every side attacked him, so that he drank the syrup of
martyrdom, and his comrades, one after another, were levelled

round him on the bed of annihilation. Neamat Khim, on see-
ing this, without cuirass and armour, tying a sword to his
unlined garment, mounted a swift charger, cnt through the right
and left wings of the enemy’s force, and, dashing up to the centre,
inflicted a cut on the head of Rahim Shah. As fate would have
it, Neamat’s sword striking against the latter’s helmet broke
From ferocity of disappointed rage, putting his grip on Rahim’s
face and seizing ns waist with the hand, by sheer strength,
Neamat dismounted Rahim from his horse and threw him on the
ground. With great agility then springing from his own horse,
Neamat sat on the top of Rahim’s chest, and drawing a dagger
from his waist struck him on the throat. Accidentally, the
dagger got entwined in the link of the cuirass of Rahim and dia
not penetrate through to his throat Meanwhile, the adherents
of Rahim Shah coming up wounded Neamat Khan, by inflicting
cuts on him with swords and spears, so that he was disabled, and
dragging him down from his saddle, they threw him down
on the ground. Rahim Shah, recovering life in a way a second
time, remained unhurt and unscathed. And they carried Neamat
Khan to a tent, with Ins flickering life,in a state of fainting.
From excessive thirst, he opened his eyes to signal for water.
When the men of Rahim Shah brought a cup of water, his feel-
ings revolted against his drinking it out of their hands, and thus
with a parched lip he quaffed the goblot of martyrdom. The
zamindars of the environs and the news-messengers, in succession,
carried this woful news to Nawab Ibrahim Khan, to Jahangir-

nagar (Dacca). The Nawab, to whom the following couplet is
applicable :-—

“ Although possessed of the strength of a lion,
In seeking vengeance, he was flabby like a soft sword ”

owing to pusillanimity, said: ‘“ War causes the spilling of blood
of God’s cieatures; what necessity is there that the blood of people
on both sides should be shed ?”' And when from messages and
news-letters, the gist of this disaster reached the Emperor in
the Dakhin, an Imperial order was despatched to Zabardast Khan,
son of Ibrahim Khan, conferring on him the office of Fanjdar !

1 Apparently, Zabaidast Khan was appomted to the office of Faujdar

of the chaklahas of Bardwan, Mednipur, etc., insisting on the
chastisement of the miscreant enemy, and directing the Nazims
and Fanjdars of the Subahs of Oudh and Allahabad and Behar,
that, wherever they might get trace of the enemy, they should
capture him with his women and children. It was also proclaimed
‘hat whoever would desert the enemy should be granted security
of life, and whoever would join the enemy and thereby draw the
paint of infamy on the face, should have his family extirpated. And
so it came to pass. Shortly after, the Subahdari of Bengal and
Behar was conferred on Prince ‘Azimu-sh-shan, who was ordered
to proceed to Bengal with a numberof the Imperial officers.! The
noble Khan, named Zabardast Khan, on the very receipt of the
Imperial order, fitting out u fleet of war-vessels armed with
artillery, sailed op from Jahangirnagar (Dacca) with a numerous
force, and spurred on the charger of war. Rahim Shah, on hear-
ing news of the approach of the Imperial army of vengeance,
swiftly marched to the banks of the Ganges, with a large army,
consisting of infantry and cavalry. Zabardast Khan, mooring his
war-vessels alongside the river-bank, quickly entrenched himself
in front of the enemy's force, arrayed his troops for battle, and
placed in front of the entrenchment of those Gog-like people the
projecting parts of waggons, m the shape of Alexander’s wall.
On the next day, advancing from his entrenchment, he arrayed
his troops, posting armed heroes and warriors in the right and left
wings, in the centre, in the van, and intherear. Placing the
aitillery in front, he advanced like the wave of the sea, and struck
the ketiledrum of war. When the din of call to battle resounded
in the ear of Rahim Shah, the latter became perturbed, but moved
with his intrepid Afghan soldiers to encounter the Imperialists.
From the side of the Imperialists, Zabardast Khan ordered the
artillery to be brought into action, and directed the discharge of
vauskets and war-rockets. The gunners and musketeers and
rocketeers did not slacken their fire, whilst gallant combatants
eharged with their swords, and worked havoc in the enemy's
ranks.

The eartn up to the sky became pitchy dark.

From profuse spilling of blood on that battle-field,

One roa: ing sea of crimson was spread.

The heads of warriors iooked like ripples therein,

Their corpses swam like fish therein.

After terrible carnage, the cowardly Afghans took to ther
heels and Rahim Shah retreated from the field. Zabardast
Khan, who was strong and agile, became triumphant, and striking
blows after blows, drove the Afghans like cattle to their tents.
For three fall hours the fire of warfare continued to blaze. Towards
sun-down, owing to the excessive sultriness of the wind, and
owing to terrible exertion and fatigue, the cavalry had to give up the
chase. So the victors withdrew their hands from the work of blazing
the fire of warfare and encamped on tho battle-field, and set about
washing, and burying the dead, and nursing and dressing the
wounded. They passed the night in alertness and watchfuluess,
posting advance-gusrds and night-patrols. Next morning when
the King of the Hast,’ riding on a blue charger® and suspending
the dagger of rays, advanced on the plain of the celestial sphere,
the darkness of the hosts of night and the troops of stars became
effaced, nay extinguished, by its one onset; and again triumphantly
seeking vengeance, the victors set about setting their forces in
battle-array. On the approach of the two armies, they charged
with their spears, swords, and daggers. The Imperialists tying the
girdle of devotion and self-sacrifice to the waist of their lives,
engaged in killing the insurgents, and piled up a heap from the
slain. And after two hours’ fighting the Afghan force was once
again shattered. Rahim Shah, stooping to the disgrace of flight,
fied, and in a hapless state took the route to Murshidabad.
Zabardast Khan to a distance of one farsakh rode forward, beat
and chased the enemy; captured and slew a large number of the
rebels, and capturing their treasrres, effects, armaments and horses,

triumphantly returned to his own camp. He then made a gift of
the booty to the soldiers, according to their rank, and did not
spare himself 1 w'nning their hearts. For three days he halted
there, and looked after the nursing of the wounded. For the pur-
pose of effectually blockading the passages, and cuting off the
enemy’s supplies he despatched stringent orders to the zammdars
and watchmen of passages. He sent the wounded soldiers, together
with the more precious goods and spoils, to Jahangirnagar (Dacca),
and detailed scouts in all directions for ascertaining the where-
abouts of those who had fled. Rahim Shah, in a hapless condition
and in an anxious mood, reached Murghidahad, and there exerted
himself diligently to mobilise troops. Rallying round some of his
vanquished rabble, who were in a state of disorder, and also others
who were in straits and. without armour and helmets, he opened out
his treasures and chests, and by distributing horses and arms and
by lavishing money, he quickly mobilised an army, and once again
prepared. for battle. Zabardast Khan,’ on the fourth day, striking
the kettledrum of march from the battle-field, advanced in pursuit
of the enemy towards Murshidabad. In the meantime, the zamin-
dars of the vicinity flocked in and joined the Imperialists. After
marching several stages, Zabardast Khan encamped on the east
side of the plain. Rahim Shah, seeing the overwhelming force of
the Imperialists, felt himself no match for them, and cowardly fled to
Bardwan. Zabardast Khan hotly chased him and gave him no rest.

was appointed Sitbadar of Bengal and Behar.

For the chastisement of the rebels, he started from the Daxhin
with his two sons, named Sultan Karimuddin and Muhammad
Farukh Sir for the Subah of Behar, and swiftly arrived in Behar
vtd Subah Oadh and Allahabad. The Prince issued Royal mandates,
as potent as God’s decrees, summoning to his presence the Zamin-
dars, ‘Amils, and Jagirdars. These appeared in His Highness’
presence with tributes and gifts, and were recipients of valuable
Khillats according to their respective ranks. And attending to
the administration of the State affairs, they paid in the revenue and
taxos into the Imperial treasury. The fiscal and administrative
affairs were entrusted to honest Diwans and thrifty Karkuns, and
Tahsildars were appointed to charges of Circles and Mahals.
All of a sudden, news of the victory of Zabardast chan and of

tion of such valuable services, might be invested with the office of
Stibahdar of Bengal, the ambitious Shahzidah, moving from Stibah
Behar, swiftly marched to Rajmahal, and spurring his horse for the
chastisement of the rebels advanced with his large force to Bardwan.
The Prince ignored Zabardast Khan’s services, and failed to bestow
on him a single word of praise or encouragement. The aforesaid
Khan, becoming depressed by the apathy of the Shahzidah, and
finding his great labours wasted, resolved to proceed to the Emperor.
Caring not for the power of the Shahvadah, he struck the kettle-
drum of march, and took the rouwfe to the Dakhin. Rahim Shih
who, fiom fear of the fury of that lion of the forest of warfare, had
been hiding like the fox and the jackal, in the holes of the mouse
and the serpent, finding now an opportunity, brought back water
into the rivulet of his ambition, and triumphantly made incursions
ou the frontiers of Bardwan, Hugli, and Nadia. Pillaging the in-
habitants of that tract he desolated it, nay rendered it aden
of wild beasts and a nest of owls and crows. After the
departure of Zabardast Khan the Prince, with great self-reliance,
despatched mandates and orders to Jahangirnagar (Dacca) for
conciliating and reassuring the Zamindars and Faujdars. His
Highness himself, slowly marching from Akbarnagar (Rajmahal),
advanced stage by stage, studying the convenience of his troops.
The ‘Amils, Faujdars, and zamindars, with appropriate contingents
drawn from their respective mahals, presented themselves before
the Prince with gifts and tributes, and accompanied the latter in his
Royal Piogress. Theill-fated Rahim Shah, fancying the news of
the approach of the Prince to be a fiction, hke his own fate, was
sleeping the sleep of negligence. When, however, the news of
the approach of the Royal Army reached the ear of that wretch,
he hurriedly and anxiously concentrated his Afghan levies who were
scattered far and near, and prepared for warfare. Thatroyal eagle
of the summit of the Empire, caring not for that flock of spérrows,

bravery, scon gave him an umque position amongst the Imperial officers of
his day, and he enjoyed the full confidence of his sovereign, who used to call
him “ Yar Ofadar” or the “ faithfal friend.”

slig important pubhe works were (1) the irrigation ef a large canal
joming the river Ravi with Lahore city ; (2) the establishment of a splendid
public garden called “Shalamar” together with aqueducts, reservoirs, and
fountains, on the banks of that canal, close to Lahore. (See Maasir-ul-Omara,
Vol. II, p 807).

set out unhesitatingly, without baggage and paraphernalia, and
pitched his camp in the outskirts of Bardwan. There the Prince
suspended the royal pearl of salutary advice to the ear of that con-
temptible prevaricator, promised reward in the event of acceptance,
and threatened vengeance in the event of refusal. That dissembler
treated the bright pearl of the order of the Prince ostensibly as
the jewel of the ear, but covertly as the gravel of his own eyes, that
is, apparently he shewed signs of submission, but in reality, he
sowed the thorn of rebellion and dissimulation in tle field of his
heart. He besought to his assistance Khwajah Anwar, elder brother
of Khwajah ‘Agam,! who was a high officer and a boon companion of
the Prince, and in fact the latter's prime-miuister, and represented.
that in case the Khwajah came and promised on oaths and re-assured.
his mind, next morning he would proceed in his company to the
Prince’s presence, to sue for pardon for misdemeanour. Theguileless
Prince, ignorant of the wiles of that traitor, asseuting to his request,
ordered the above Khwajah to proceed early in the morning to
Rahim Shih’s camp, and instructed him to reassure the latter and
to fetch him to the Royal Darbar to publicly avow submission.
Next morning the abovementioned Khwajah, following the order
of his master, adopted no measures of precaution, and rode out with a
few relations and friends. Halting in front of the camp of Raihm
Shah, he sent information, and on horseback remained on the
look-out, Hiding bis armed Afghan soldiers in his tent, Rahim
Shah was in pursuit of treachery. Opening towards the envoy
the door of wiles and softness, he requested that the Khwajah should
enter his camp. Fearing lest smoke might arise from the fire of
the reptile, the above Khwajah hesitated to go in, and making
promises summoned out Rahim Shah. When the demands of both
sides resulted in a parley and the object of the mission remained
anaccomplished, suddenly Rahim Shab with an armed force sallied
out of his camp shouting and advanced in front of the Khwajah.
From wounds of the tengue it culminated in wounds of the
spear. Fathoming the water underneath the straw, Khwajah
Anwar, regretted his coming, and wanted to return without ac-

received the titles of “Samsam-ud-daulah Khan Dauran Amir-ul-Umara.”

complishing the object of his mission. Rahim Shah, advancing
forward, commenced fighting. Being compelled to encounter him,
Khwajah Anwar gallantly and bravely fought, and made heroic
exertions, but being covered with mortal wounds, fell together with
a number of his comrades. Finding the field deserted, the
Afghans with swords rushed out and attacked the Royal camp
of the Prince.

When that scion of the Imperial family

Beheld perfidy in that prevaricator,

And also in regard to the condition of Khwajah Anwar,

News arrived that his head hatl been severed from his body ;

His face became cherry from rage,

He called for arms from the armour-bearer,

He placed the cuirass on the shoulder and the helmet on the
head,

From head to foot he became a figure of iron.

He suspended an adamantine sword,

And placed tightly a dagger in his waist.

He tied one sunny shield to his shoulder,

And placed a shining spear in his hand.

He hung a quiver from his waist,

And threw round the shoulder a Kaianian bow !

He tied a noose to the top of his howdah,

And clutched with the hand an iron mace.

He gave order that the Generals of the army

Should collect quickly near the Royal tents.

At his order, the battle-seeking army

Flocked in towards the Prince.

When the Prince mounted his elephant,

He looked like the sun on a mountain.

The kettledrum of battle was struck, and the army moved,

Like the 1iver waving.

He advanced to the field and raised aloft his standard,

And boldly set himself to put his troops in array.

He arranged. his centre and wings:

The right and left wings, the rear and the van.

fantry, like the men at chess, were set in their proper places,
Rahim Shah made a hostile flank movement, and fought gallantly.
A number of Afghan troopers clad in cuirass and armed with
daggers, by a desperate sally, galloped right through the ranks of
the Imperialists, reached the centre, and sought for the Prince,
shouting out ‘ Azimu-sh-Shan.” Atfacking the Royal elephant
with their horses, they prepared to give the final checkmate. The
Imperial cavalry and infantry, unable to withstand the onslaughis
of those villains, left the Prince in a corner before the enemy and
fied. Thus the thread of the arrangement of the Imperial army
was snapped. Rahim Shah, breaking through the entrenchments,
attacked the Prince’s elephant. At this crisis, and at the sight
of this impudent daring, Hamid Khan Quraishi,’ who was standing
at a short distance, spurred on bis charger like an arrow shot from
its bow, attacked Rahim Shah, and said, “ Villain, I am Azimu-gh-
Shin.” Promptly discharging a rock-piercing arrow from his
quiver, he pierced Rahim Shah on the chest.

He pulled out his bow from its string

And drew out his Khadang® arrow from its quiver.
He joined the arrow-notch to the ass’s leather,

And aimed at that giant.

When the arrow-notch was shot to take aim,

It pierced through the breast of that fighting demon,
Piercing right through his breast,

It figured like the balance from weight.

In quick succession Hamid Khin shot other arrows at the
neck of Rahim Shah’s horse, and laid low both its neck and head.
Rahim Shih, owing to two mortal wouuds on the breast, was

felled tothe ground. Hamid Khin with great agility sprang
down from his horse, and sat upon Rabim Shah's chest, and sever-
ing the villain’s head from his body whirled itround on a spear.
At the sight of this, the cowardly Afghan soldiery faltered and fled,
whilst the standards of those insolent villains were turned upside
down. The zephyr of triumph and victory once again blew on the
tails of the Imperial banners, and the Imperial band of victory and
trinmph struck up londly, whilst cries of “ Allah, Allah” resounded
from the earth to the sky. The cavalry of the victorious Imperial
army chased the vanquished to their tents, and whoever amongst
young or old fell across the range of its career became the food of
the crocodile of blood-drinking swords ; whilst the rest who escaped
the sword, scampered off, covered with wounds and racked by
anxieties. Much booty and numerous captives fell into the hands
of the Imperialists. The fortunate Prince, an associate of triumph
and victory, entered Bardwan, and made a pilgrimage to the noble
shrine of the saint Shah Ibrahim! Saqqd. Making votive offerings,
the Prince entered the citadel, and sent a congratulatory message
on this victory to the Emperor, and despatched troops for
chastising the adherents and abettors of the miscreant Afghans.
Wherever trace could be found of their whereabouts, they were
captured and slaughtered, and in a short time the districts of
Bardwan, Hugli, and Jasar (Jessore) were purged of the defilement
caused by the Afghan raiders. The tracts that had heen desolated
by the ravages of these rebels once again became fertile, Jagat
Rai, son of Kishan Ram, the slain Zamindar of Bardwan, was in-
vested with the khilat of the hereditary Zamindari of his forefathers.
In a similar way, other Zamindars of that tract who had been
oppressed and banished by the Afghans, were re-assured by Royal
Proclamations of goodwill, and re-installed in their hereditary
ranks and dignities. Taking fresh settlements of the Khalsah
mahals (crown lands) andof Jagirs, these commenced making collec-
tions of rent; whilst the holders of Tiyuls® and ‘Aimahe and

time on Mansabdars in lien of salaries, and algo on others by way of reward
during lifetime or a fixed period. In the early Mughal period, the word
“tynol” is frequently mentioned, but it frequently gives way to the word

Altamghas re-entered into the possession of their respective mahals.
Hamid Khan Quraishi, in recognition of his gallantry was re-
warded by the Emperor with theadvancementof his mangab, with the
bestowal of the title of Shamshir Khan Bahadur, and with the office
of Faujdar of Silhat (Sylhet) and Bandasil (P). And the other offi-
cers of the Prince, who had rendered good services, according to
the measure of their services, and according to their ranks, were
honoured with mansabs and dignities. The Prince halted in the
fort of Bardwan, which contained the Residency of the Faujdars
of that district, laid the foundations of buildings, and erected a
Cathedral mosque. And in Hugli, he founded Shahgani,! alias

Jagir, from Akbar’s time. In the time of Sher Shah, the Afghan king, the
word Jagir 18 also frequently used. In the Ghorian, Khilji and Tughlak
periods, the word ‘ Iqta,’ corresponding to ‘Jagir," is frequently used, (See
Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, Tarikhi Firaz Shahi, and Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. I, p. 270).

Besides the “ Jagira” or “Iqtas” or “tiyuls,” there was another class
of land-tenures which were conferred for benevolent purposes, were hereditary
{unlike Jagirs), and free from revenue and cesses, and imposed no obligations
for military or other services. These before Mughal times were called milk,
madad-t-mash, ayema and altamghah, but were denominated in Mughal times
by the Ohagitai word “Sayirghal.” An officer called Sadr-i-Jahin, or Adminis-
trator-General, was in charge of these Sayirghals, These were conferred on the
followmg four classes of persons: (1) On enquirers after wisdom who have
withdrawn from worldly occupations and make no difference between night and
day in searching after knowledge” ; (2) on such as practise self-denial and have
renounced society of men; (3) on suchas are weak and poor and have no
strength for enquiry; (4) on honourable men of gentle birth who from want
of knowledge are unable to take ap a profession.” (See Tarikh-i-Firuz
Shahi, pp. 853, 382, and 6558, and Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. I, pp. 268, 270, 271,
272).

Sher Shah was very liberal in conferring these awmahs and altamghas,
which, however, were considerably resumed by Akbar who, on account of his
hatred of the Ulama, deprived them of their madad-t-mash lands, and
banished most of them to Bengal. (See note in Ain-s-Akhart, Vol. I, p. 270,
and Badadom, Vol Ii, pp 274, 276, 279).

Altamgha, a Tarkish wo1d, meant a ‘red royal seal or stamp’ and also a
‘royal grant’ of rent-free tenure, which was perpetual, hereditary, and
transferable. (See Ain, Vol II,p 57”). In founding this system of Sayur-
ghels or Altamghos, the Musalman Rulers were actuated by « desire to per-
petuate the three aristecracies of birth, of character, and of intellect.
Care was taken to also maintain more or less permanently the fourth
aristocracy of wealth, as the Zamindars under Mughal Emperors were more
or less permanent quast-state functionaries.

sohicitude to profit by the advice of saints and he exerted himself
to promcte the welfare of the realm. One day he sent Sultan
Karimi-d-din and Muhammad Farukh-sir to invite over Sufi
Biaizid,* who was the most glorious amongst the saints of Bard-
wan. On their approach the saint greeted them with the saluta-
tion of “Salam Alaekum.” Sultan Karimi-d-din, assuming the
gravity of princely rank, did not respond ; but Farukh-sir walking

communicated his father’s message. The saint, being pleased
with the courteous behaviour of Farukh-sir, took the latter by the
hand, and said: “Sit down, you are Emperor of Hindustan,”
and he offered prayer for Farukh-sir. The arrow of the saint’s
prayer reached the butt of Divine acceptance. As a result of
courteous behaviour on the part of Farukh-sir, what the site desired
was bestowed on the son. When the saintarrived to meet ‘Azimu-
sh-Shian, the latter advanced, and making apologies besought the
saint's prayer for the attainment of the object which His Highness
had in view. Thesaint said: “What you seek, I have already
bestowed on Farukh-sir, and now the discharged arrow cannot be
recalled.” Offering the Prince benedictions, the saint returned to
his own closet. In short, being satisfied with the administrative
methods and arrangements introduced in respect of the affairs of the
tracts of the Ohaklah of Bardwan, Hugli, Hijli, and Midnipur, &c.,
the Prince set out on Imperial war-vessels, constructed by Shah
Shuja, towards Jahangirnagar (Dacca). After arrival at Dacca,
he set himself to organise the administration of that tract. When
information about certain improper acts of the Prince like prac-
tices of Sauda-i-Khds and Sauda-i-‘Am, and the wearing of saffron-
coloured red clothes at the time of the Holt, which is the Nawroz
or New Year of the Hindus, through the medium of messages of
news-writers and historiographers, reached Emperor Aurangzeb,
the latter was annoyed.! The Emperor wrote thereon to the Prince
asfollows: ‘A Saffron-coloured helmet on thy head, a red garment
on thy shoulder, thy venerable age verging on forty-six years;
hurrah on thy beard and moustache!” In regaid to Sauda-i-Khag
the Emperor wrote the following across the news-letter, and putting
his own signature returned it: “What propriety is there in

caustic and terse letters full of withering sarcanms, few Persian writers surpass
Aurangzeb. He was in the habit of constantly writmg D.-O. letters to his
officers, in order to keep them straight, The reader who wishes to have a
taste of Aurangzeb’s caustic sarcasm, might turn to the original Persian,

Sauda\-i Khas with Sauda-i-‘Am P

Those who purchase—sell ;
We neither purchase nor sell ”

And by way of censure, to serve as a deterrent, the
Emperor reduced the Prince’s mansab by 500. The meanings
vf Sauda-i-Khig and Sauda-t-‘Am are as follows: “ All the goods
which arrived on board the mercantile ships at the port of Chatgaon
(Chittagong), &c., were bought up on behalf of the Prince,’ and were
styled Sauda-i-Khas ; afterwards those very goods were re-sold to
the merchants of this country, when they were called Sauda-c-
‘Am. When the news-letter containing the Emperor's signature
came to be perused by the Prince, the latter abandoned the afore-
said trade. The Emperor Aurangzeb appointed Mirza Hadi to the
office of Diwan of the Province.of Bengal, after bestowing on
him the title of Kar Talab Khinu. The Mirza_was a saga-
cious man, and an officer of honesty and integrity. He had
already held the office of Diwan of the Saibah of Orissa. In
several Mahals pertaining to Orissa he had effected retrenchments
in expenditure, and had thus become prominent amongst the
Imperial officials. He was held matchlessin probity and rectitude
of purpose. Rendering eminent services, in periods of siege and
war, hehad got into the good graces of Emperor Aurangzeb. At
that period, the reins of the administration of Financial and
Revenue affairs, the power over the assessment and collection of
revenue, and payments into and disbursements from the Impenal
Treasury lay in the hands of the Diwan of the Subah. The Na-
zim had jurisdiction over the Procedure and Administration of
Political affairs, such as the repression and chastisement of the
refractory and the disobedient, and the extirpation of rebels and
tyrants. Hxcept with regard to the Jagirs attached to the Nizamat
and personal Mangabs and presents, the Nazim had no power to

3 “ Azimu-sh-Shan was lazy and covetous. ~ He was ready to concede any-
thing for a sufficient bmbe.” In July 1698, for the sum of Rs. 16,000, the
Enghsh were permitted by the Prince to purchase from the existing holders
the right of renting the three villages of Calcutta, Sutanati, and Gobindpnr,

meddle with the Imperial revenue. Both the Nazim and the Diwan
were guided in the administration of the affairs of the Subah by a
Procedure Code! that was issued year after year by the Emperor,
and they were not permitted to deviate from, or infringe, them
by a hair-breadth. Kar Talab Khan, being appointed by Emperor
to be Diwan of the Subah of Bengal, arrived at Jahangirnagar
(Dacca). After waiting on the Prince, he devoted himself to the
administration of the fiscal affairs And the remittances into, and
disbursements from, the Treasury being in charge of the above-
mentioned Khan, the Prince’s control over the income and expendi-
ture ceased. The abovementioned Khan, finding that the country
was without thorns, and fertile and rich, commenced re-assessment,
and deputed sagacious and thrifty Collectors to every Parganah
and Qhaklah and Sarkar. And after assessing accurately the
Imperial revenne and sair taxes, he remitted one Kror of rupees to
the Emperor, and piepared a complete Revenue-roll of the Khalsuh
mahals (crown lands) and of the Jagirs. In former times, owing to
the badness of the climate of Bengal, the higher officers did not
care to seek for service in this Province, as they fancied it not
only fatal to human hives, but as actual haunts of demons.
Therefore, the Chief Imperial Diwins, by way of inducement, con-
ferred numerous Jagirs in Bengal on the Bengal Mansadars. In
consequence of this policy, very few Khalsah mahals were left
in Bengal, so that the revenue of the mahals of this Subah did
not suffice to meet either the pay of the soldiers under the Prince,
or that of the nagdi troops. Therefore, their pay had to be
provided for from revenues of other Subahs. The aforesaid
Khan submitted a scheme to the Hmperor suggestiug allotment of
lands in Orissa on account of Jagirs to the Bengal Mangabdars ;#

1 The Procedure Code or Manual, containing set rules and regulations on
all revenue and administrative affairs, waa called in Persian Dastur-ul-‘Amal,
It was issued to all Provincial Governors, Administrators, and officials after
being personally approved by the Emperor himself, and every year modifi-
cations or additions were made to it with the Hmperor’s approval. No
provincial Administrators, whether Nazims or Diwans, had authority to
deviate from the set rnles contained in the Dastur-ul-‘Amal. Badaons (Vol. I,
pp. 884-885) states that in the time of Salim Shah, son of Sher Shah, the
Dastur-ul-Amul waa so comprehensive and oxplicit that even on Neclesiastical
matters (not to speak of Fiscal or Administrative matters), no reference to
(jazis or Muftis was necessary.

§ The Manyabdars were the higher officers under the Mughal Kx:perors ,

and this scheme met with the Emperor's approval. The Khin!
thereon resumed all Jagws in Bengal, together with their seir
revenues, save and except such as pertained to the Nizamat and
the Diwani,? and allotted in lien thereof Jagtrs to the Bengal
mansabdars in Orissa, the soil whereof was comparatively worse,
poorer, more sterile, and less fertile. By this ingenious stroke of
policy, the Khan effected a big surplus in the Bengal reverne to
the credit of the Emperor, and squeezed ont the profits from the
Bengal Zamindars and Jagirdars. And by minnte attention to
details, he effected considerable vetrenchments under the several
Heads of the Public Expenditure. Year after year, he euhanced the
Revenue-assessments of the Subah, and thus became the re-
cipient of Imperial favours. When the Prince (‘Azimu-sh-Shian)
found his control over the Bengal revenue diminished, he was con-
stantly ina bad humour. Besides, the rewards which the Khan
received for his good services from the Emperor weighed as thorns of
envy on the heart of the Prince, and kindled the fire of his jealousy.
The Prince schemed to kill the Khan, but failed in his aim.
The Prince won over to his side the Commander of Nugdi troops

the term, however, was also used in the times of Sher Shah, The leading
Mansabdara were either Provincial Governors or Generals in the Army,
whilst other Mangabdars held Jagus. These Mansabdars sometimes held
Mangab (or office) in one Province or Sibah, and Jagir lands i in another.
(Sea din-1-Akbari, Vol I, pp. 241-242, Blochmann’s trans.)

i Revenue from land was called Khiraj. Jassayah was capitation tux
levied from non-Moslem subjects in exchange for protection afforded, at the
rate of “48 derhams for persons of condition, 24 derhams for those of the
middle class, and 12 for the lowest class.” Over and above the land-revenue,
taxes on properties were called “ Tamgha.” Imports on mannfactures of
respectable kinds were called Jthat, and the remainder Sair Jéhat, Sair in its
original purport, meant “ walking,” ‘moving,’ or ‘unstable, and so came to
denote all unstable sources of state revenue (barriug land-revenus or Khiraj
which was stable), such as customs, transit duties, market-tax (See Vol. t,
pp. 57 and 58 and p, 66, din-1-Akbar, for a list of Sair taxes abolished by
Emperor Akbur).

& Jagirs were conferred on Mangabdars for military service, and on
others they were conferred without requiring military service. Before
Mughal times the word “Iqta” corresponding to “Jagir” 1s frequently met
with in the Tabagat-i-Nagri as well as in the Tarikh-i.firuz Shahi. Bat
in histones of the Mughal period, the word ‘Iqta’ ig seldom met with, and
is replaced by the word Jag, In Akbar's tite, an officer called Diwan-1,
Jugu or Superintendent of Jagirs was mamtamed. (See din, Vol. I, p. 261).

named Abdul Wahed and the Nagdi Contingent under the latter,
by holding ont promises of rewards and increase in pay. These
nagdt troops were old Imperial servants. From pride of their
sti ength and from confidence in their number, they did not truckle
to the Nazim or Diwan of Dacca, and much less to others.
From their conceit of bemg dexterous swordsmen, they fancied
others no match for themselves. For their nonchalance and
bravado,! they were widely known. These nagdi troops were
incited to waylay the Khan when opportunity might offer, under
the pretext of demand of pay, and to kill him. This wicked
Contingent at the instigation of the Prince were on the look-out
for an opportunity to kill the Khan. The Khan adopting piecau-
tionary measures, always carried in his retinue an escort of
armed troops, and never failed to be on the alert whilst going to
and from the Darbar. One day, however, early of a morning, he
rode out unattended to wait on the Prince. On the way, a
corps of nagdis, under pretext of demanding pay, raised a tumult,
and crowded in round the Khan. The latter, displaying preat
nerve, faced them and drove them away. Ascertaining that
the originator of this disturbance was the Prince, he in fury and
rage proceeded to the latter. Discarding all official decorum,
in an avenging mood, he placed his hand on his dagger, and sat
knee to knee with the Prince, and added: “This riot was due to
your instigation, desist from this course, or else at this moment
I will take your life and give mine.” The Prince saw no way of
escape, and from fear of the Hmperor’s resentment he trembled
hike the aspen. Summoning Abdul Wahed with his corps, the
Prince publicly forbade him from creating tumult and disturbance,
and set about soothing the Khan by display of courtesy and
affability. The Khan, being freed from anxiety arising from the
hostility of his enemies, proceeded to the Diwan-i-Am, demanded
the account of nagdi troops, levied their pay from Zamindars,
and paying them off cashiered them. And he sent the Emperor
an account of their meeting, embodying the same both in the

their pay in cash from the Imperial treasury, and were reckoned immediate
servants of the Emperor. They constituted an Imperial Contingent of troops
maintained in Provincial capitals, and were thoroughly independent of the
local authorities, and were ¢hus digmfied by their independence. (See Ain-¢-

Court-Revord as well as in the News-sheet.!' He also submitted
to the Emperor s Proceeding signed by the leaders of the riot,
together with his own Report. Fearing the ul-humour of the
Prince, the Khan resolved to keep himself aloof from the
former, and to stay at a safe distance from him After much
deliberation and consultation, he fixed on the excellent site of
Makhsusaébad, where news of all the four quarters of the Subah
could be easily procurable, and which, hke the pupil of the
eye, was situate in the centre of the important places of the
Subah. It had on the north-west the chaklah of Akbarnagar
(Raymahal) and the passes of Sakiigali and Tiliagadhi, the
‘Key’ to Bengal, on the south-west, Birbhiim, Pachit and
Bighanpur, the road to Jharkand, and the forests and hilly passes
for the ingress and egress of free-booters and armies from the
Daklin and Hindustan, on the south-east, the chaklah of Bardwan,
the road to Orissa, and Hughli and Hijli ( ports for the arnival of
ships of Christian and other traders), and the chahlahs of Jasar
(Jessore) and Bhisnah, and on the east the chaklah of Jahangir.
uagar (Dacca), which then constituted the Viceregal Capital of
this Subah, and to which pertained frontier outposts like those of
Islamabad or Chittagong, and Silhat and Rangamati, and on the
north, the chaklahs of Gborighat and Rangpur and Kuch Behar.
The above meutioned Khan, without taking permission from the
Prince, migrated to Makhsusabad with the officers of Zamindars
and Qanfingos and Revenue officials in charge of crown-lands, and
settled down there. But when the news of the disturbance created
by the nagdis reached the Emperor in the Dakhin through tho

1 The terms used are “Wagiah” and “Sawanih” The Mughal Emperors
maintained a Special Intelhgence Department. In every Provincial capital
and important centre, two special funciaonanes were maimbained by the
Mughal Emperors, one called “Sawanih-navis,” and the other “ Waqiah-
navis.’ These were Imperial servants, quite independent of the local officials.
The duties of both these functionaries were to daily record and send news to
the Emperor of all that trauspized in local centies, and as they worked
independently of one another, the report of intelligence sent by one checked
that of the other. The “ Waqiah-navis” was an official Court-Recorder,
whilst the “Sawanih-navis” was an official General Intelligence-giver.
(See din-1-Akbari, Vol. I, pp. 253 and 259) The object in keeping up
these functionaries was that the Emperor at Delhi might “be informed daily
of all that transpired throughont -his Empire, and also that netive servants
might work without fear, and neghgent and foigetful men be held in check:

medium of News-letters and Court-records, and through the Report
of Kar Talab Khan containing denunciation of the Prince, an Impe-
rial edict couched in threatening language was addressed to the
\Prince to the following effect: “ Kar Talab Khan is an officer of the
Emperor; in case a hair-breadth injury, in person or property,
happens to him, I will avenge myself on you, my boy.” And
peremptory orders were also passed by the Hmperor to the effect
that the Prince should quit Bengal and withdraw to Behar.
Jeaving Sarbaland Khan‘ with Saltan Farokh-sir as his Deputy in
Bengal, the Prince with Sultan Karimu-d-din, his household
attendants and bodyguard set out from Jahangirnagar, and reach-
ed Maingir(Monghyr). Finding there the elegant white and black
marble edifices 4 built by Shah Shuja to be in a dilapidated condi-
tion, and seeing that a heavy outlay would be needed to set them
in order, he did not like to fix his quarters there. And preferring
the climate of Patna, which is on the bank of the river Ganges, the
Prince fixed his quarters there. With the Emperor's sanction, he
improved that city, named it ‘Azimabad after himself, and built
there a fort with a strong rampart. Kar Talab Khan, at Makhsu-
sibad, after the lapse of a year, prepared the Annual Abstract
Accounts, and started for the Impenal Camp.8 And preparing the
Revenue-Assessment papers, the Revenue-Roll, the estate Ledgers,
and the Cash-Account of Receipts and Disbursements of the Subah,
he desired Darab Narain, the Qaniango of the Subah of Bengal, to
sign them. Taking advantage of the system then in force that
the Accounts relating to the financial and internal administration
of the country were not passed by the Imperial Central Diwan,
unless they bore the signatures of Qaniingos, that mischievous
and shortsighted fool refused to sign the papers, unless his demand
for three laks of rupees on account of his fees as @ Qaniingo
were satisfied. The Khan under stress of necessity promised to

of Bengal, received a bribe of Rs, 45,000 from the English merchants, and

Annals, Vol I, p. 188).

subsequently.

Darab Narain would not accept this arrrangement, and withheld
his signature. But Jinarain Quniingo, who was a Joint-Qaningo !
with Darab Narain, using foresight, signed the Accounts.
Regardless of the, hostility of the Prince, and regardless of
the :efusal of Darab Narain to sign the Account-papers,

and tributes of Bengal to the Emperor and to the Vizier and
other Imperial Ministers, and also paid fo the Emperor the

ambition, and kept in order all diaturbing elements in the Dakhin Their
political effacement resulted in letting loose a number of Mahi atta free-booters
and other adventurers that had hitherto had no political existence, and hastened
the growth of the Muhratta Confederacy that later on in & great measure,
coupled with other forces, distracted the Great Mughal Bmpire. By use of a
liberal and statesman-like policy, Aurangzeb might have federated those
Musnrlman States in the Sonth into Imperial feudatories, and thus converted
them into strong and loyal bulwarks of the Mughal Empire But fanaticism
in this matter (see Maasw-1-Alamgir, which explains that this policy of re-
pression was adopted by Aurangzeb, by renson of certain religious innovateons
thas were in force in those States) fatally clouded the otherwise clear political
vision of this Great Maghal Emperor, to the lasting detriment of the Indo-
Moslem Common-wealth.

customs aud land-tenures and whoge appointment was usually hereditary. He
reveived reports from the patwaris \land-stewards) of new cases of alluvion
and diluvion, sales, leases, gifts of land,’ eto. (Sea Azn-i-Akbart, Vol, II,
p. 47 2).

Over the district Qaniingos, there was a Provincial Qaniingo as the text
indicates. (Seenlso p 66, Vol. II, Ain-t-Akbari, which sets forth functions
and emoluments of Putwaris, Qaniingos, Shiqdar, Karkuns, and Amins).

In the Ain-i-Akbasi (Vol. 11, p. 49) ibis stuted that it was the duty of
the Bettkchi or Accountant, “at the year’s end, when the time of revenne-
collections had closed, to record the balunces due, and deliver the record to
the Collector, and forwatd a copy to the Royal Court.” It would seem from
the text the same daty in regard to the entire Sabah had to be performed by
the Provincial Diwan and the Provincial Qaniingo.

the recipient of further Imperial favours, and was appointed by the
Emperor Deputy to the Prince in the Nizamat of the Subah of
Bengal and-Orissa, 1n addition to the office of Diwan. He was also
given the title of Murghid Qiali Khan, and further received a

JAFAR KHAN, AS DEPUTY TO PRINCE
AZIMU-SH-SHAN.

When Murshid Qili Khin® being invested according to the
former usage with the khilat of the offices of Deputy Nazim of
Bengal Diwan of Bengal and Odisa (Orissa), reached the Subah,
ho appointed Syed Akram Khin to be his Deputy Diwan in
Bengal, and Shujau-d-din Muhammad Khan, his son-in-law, to
bo his Deputy Diwan in Odisa (Orissa). After his arrival at

papers, such as Royal grants, payment-orders, sanads, far mans, state-accounts,
ete., and then to signandseal them. (See Ain-1-Akbari, Vol. I, pp. 262, 268, 264),
L The Diwan-t-Kul was the Central Imperial Diwan-in-Chief. It would
appear the keen administrative genius of the Mughal Rulera of India evolved
aud organised a perfect system of Accounts as well as of Audit. Two indepen-
dent systems of Account and Audit (each checking the other) were mamtain-
ed The patwarts kept one independent set of accounts, and the Brtikchis,
(Accountants) another. The first submitted their accounts to local or district
Qaningos, who submitted their Consolidated Accounts to the Provincial
Qoningo. THe second submitted their accounts ta’ District Collectors as well
ag copies direct to the Royal Court; and the several District Collectors sub-
mitted their cousohdated Accounts to the ‘Provincial Diwan who collected
them, and compared them with the Consolidated Accounts (independently
prepared) in the hands of the Provincial Qanéngos. Then both the Provincial
Diwan and the Provincial Qaningo signed after comparison one General Detailed
Consolidated Account together with an Abstract Account, and forwarded it
to Court, where it was first audited by the Central Musteufi and next
audited by the Diwan-1-Kul (after reference to the set of accounts already
received regulaily in the Royal Courts fiom district Buttkchis or Accoun-
tants), and lustly approved and passed by the Emperor himself. Thue, few
loop-holes were left for defalcations inaccounts. (See the text, and the Am-t-
Ahbai)

Makhsusabad, he improved that town, and named it after himself
Murshidabad, and founded a mint! there. And separating the
chakhlah of Midnipur® from the Subah of Odisa (Orissa) he
annexed it to Bengal. And imprisoning the defaulting zamindars
of the Subah, and deputing experienced and honest Collectors of
Revenue to their mahals, he attached the rents, and realised the
outstanding Imperial revenues. And putting a complete stop td
the authority of zamindars over the collection and disbursement of
the Imperial Revenue, he limited their source of income to profits
of Nénkai® tenures. And the ‘Amils’ (Collectors of revenue) under

to the Dakhin, and entered the service of Haji Abdullah Khurasani, Diwan of
Sibah Berar, He subsequently entered Imperial service, and received the title
of Kar Talab Khan, and was employed 1n the Dakhin. He rose there to be
Diwin of Haidarabad—and then to be Diwin of Bengal (on the transfer of
Ziaullab Khan), with the title of Murshnd Qili Khan. Previous to this, he was
Diwan of Orissa (Maasir-r-Alamgurt, p. 488), in the 48th year of Emperor
Aurangzeb’s reign. When Farrukh-sir ascended the throne, by payment of
large suma as presents to the Emperor, he became Sibadar of Bengal and
received a Mansab of Haft hazart. His advancement is au eloquent testimony
to the Islamic toleration (even under the mnch-abused Aurangzeb) that
made no distinction between converts and born Musalmans in matters of
official preferments. He died in 1138 A.H at Murghidabad, which he had
founded as the new Viceregal capital of Bengal, in place of Dacca or
Jahangirnagar. He was ma good finan-ier, an able accountant, and a
strong and sagacious administrator. He bulta dangeon full of filth, named
it ‘ Baikant’ or ‘ Paradise,’ and confined in it zamindars who defaulted in
payment of revenue. He re-surveyed and re-assessed Bengal, divided it into
Chaklas, and prepared a new Perfect Revenue-Roll [See Maasir-i-Alamgiri,
p. 488, and Maasw-ul-Umara, p. 751, Vol III (Pers. text)].

L A het of mint-towns in Hindustan in Akbar’s time is given in the
Ain-v-Akbari, Vol, I, p. 81. It appears that in Bengal, minting of gold

partly Gaur and partly Tandah), and that minting of silver and copper coins
took place in Bengal in Tandnh

Bengal by Murshid Qili Khan.

h* orders, sent Shigdars and Amins to every village of the
Parganahs, measured the cultivated and waste-lands, and leased
them back to tenants, plot by plot, and advanced agricultural loans
(Taqavi) to the poorer tenantry, and put forth exertions for
increase in the prodace of the lands. Thus in all the mahals
Marshid Qili effected not only increase in revenue, but also in-
crease in their areas.

Marghid Qali prepared a perfect Revenue-Roll, collected the
rents in kind, season by season, and also the Jand-revonne, sar
taxes, and fees from agricultural lands. And effecting retrenchment

duties, and were held responsible for maintenance of peace in their mahals—
the village chowkeedars or watchmen being directly under them, They were
also in charge of village ferries, village pounds, and village roads in their mahals,
and performed more or less the duties of “justices of the peace.” They were
more or less quasi-official fanctionaries, and received sanads on appointment,
and were hable to removal for grosa misconduct, Their mahals were not liable
to auction-sale for arrears of revenue, but liable to altachment by the Crown
for realisation of revenue, and defaulting zamindars were liable to punish-
ment, They were quasi-state functionaries or quast-official landed Aristocracy
maintained by Musalman sovereigns for State purposes. They were qnite
different species frum the Bengal zamindars of to-day. (See Alamgtrnamah,
Maasu -i-Alamgiit, Ain-i-Akbari and the text).

1 As has been remaiked before, Murghid Qiili Khan was an able financier,
and prepared a perfect actual Revenne-Roll of Bengnl, after carefully re-
surveying lunde in all the mahals in Bengal, and re-assessing them on the
basis of incrense in actuil aréas as ascertnined by measurement, and of
increase in the actual produce of the soil, He sent ont for this purpose
Amina (or Sui veyors) together with Shiqdare (or Supervisors of revenue) to
each village, under the immediate supervision of honest, experienced and
capable Collectora of Revenue or ‘Amila. He helped the poorer tenants
with agricultural loans or advances (taqavs or tuccavt), and enconraged
them to till their lands and improve agnioultmre. Murghid Qili Khin was no
believer in Permanent Settlements. He preferred the Ryotwari Settlement
system to the Farming system. Islamic Revenue systems recognise the soil
as State property and allot a portion of its profit or produce to the actual tiller
of the gol for his Jaboua on it,

“A Shigdar meant an ‘ officer appointed to collech revenue from a certain
division of land under the Mughal Government.”

The constitution of the Surveying party, their pay, their duties, with
the process of measurement and teating in Mughal times, are aet forth in the
4in-i Akbavi, Vol. 1, p 45, which shows that the moasurement of lands and

and Bishanpur, being protected by dense forests, mountains and
hills, did not personally appear before the Nawab, but deputed
instead their agents to carry on transactions on their behalf, and
through them used to pay in the usnal tributes, presents, and
gifts. In consideration of the fact that Asadullah, zamindar
of Birbhiim, was a pious and saintly person and had bestowed
half of his property as Maded-i-mash grants on learned,
pious and saintly persons, and had fixed daily doles of
charity for tha poor and the indigent, the Khan refrained from
molesting him. He directed his- attention, however, to the
chastiserhent of the zamindar of Bishanpur, whose items of
expenditure were heavy, and whose collections of rents from
mahals were low. The Rajahs of Tipra, Kuch Behar, and Assam
called themselves chatar dh@ri and ruling chiefs, and did not
bend their heads in submission to the Hmperor of Hindustan, and
minted coins after their own names. On hearing, however, of the
vigorous administration of the Khan, the Rajah of Assam presented
to the Khan chairs and palkis of ivory, musk, musical instruments,
feathers, fans of peacock feathers, etc., and offered his submission.
Similarly the Rajah of Kuck Behar offered presents and tribute to
the Khan. The,abovementioned Khan sent Khilats for them; and
this practice was observed year after year. The Khan, having intro-
duced order in the Financial condition of the Mahals of Bengal,
devoted his attention to the improvement of other administrative
and internal affairs. His administration was so vigorous and
successful that there was no foreign incursion nor internal distur.
bance, and consequently the military expenditure was nearly abol-
ished. He kept up only 2,000 cavalry and 4,000 infantry, and with
these he governed the Province. Through Nazir Ahmad, who was
a peon, he used to collect the revenue of Bengal. And the Khan
was 80 powerful a personality and his commands were so overawing,
that his peons sufficed to keep peace in the country, and to overawe
the refractory. And fear of his personality was so deeply impressed
on the hearts of all, both the high and the low, that the courage of
lion-Learted persons quailed in his presence. The Khan did not
allow petty zamindars access to his presence. And the mutsadis
and ‘amils and leading zamindars had not the heart to sit down

quite analogous to the existing Settlement Progedure im India.

less like statues. Hindu zamindars were forbidden to ride on
palkis, but were permitted use of Jawalahs. The mutasgadis, in
his presence, did nét! ride on horseback ; whilst the Mansabdars
attended at State functions in their military uniforms. In his
presence one could not salute another ; ‘and if anything opposed
to etiquette occurred on the part of anyone, he was immediately
censured. Hvery week he held court on two days to listen to
complaints, and used to mete out justice to the complainants,
Amongst his deeds of justice, is may be mentioned, that to avenge
the wrong done to another, obeying the sacred Islamic law, he
executed his own son.* In administration of justice, in ad-
ministration of the political affairs of the country, and in main-
tenance of the respect due to his Sovereign, he spared no one.
And he reposed no confidence in the mutagadis, and used daily
to inspect the collection and disbursement: papers and the estate
ledgers, and to sign them. At the close of each month, he used to
seize all the agreements of Khialsah (crown lands) and Jagirs.
Till the dues on account of those agreements were paid up into
the Imperial Treasury, he caused mutasadis, ‘amils, zamin-
dars, ganungos and other officers to remain in duress in the
Diwiin Khana of the Chihel Sati Palace. Setting collecting peons to
realise the dues, he did not allow the defanlters leave for eating or
drinking or for answering calls of nature, and posted spies over
the peons, so that none of the latter, owing to temptations of bribe,
might supply a drop of water to the thirsty defaulters. Week after
week they had to pass without food and drink, and at the same time
he had them suspended, head downwards, to triangles off the
ground, and had ther feet rubbed against stones, and had them
whipped; and in beating with sticks he shewed no quarter. And
he converted’ to the Muhammadan religion the amlahs of zamindars
with thei wives and children, who, inspite of being scourged with

treating and torturing defaulting zemindars throws a shade on his otherwise

sticks, failed to pay up the State revenue-collections that they
had misappropriated. Amongst these, Andinarain, zamindar of the
Chaklah of Rajshahi, who was the descendant of a Hindustani,
and who was both capable and efficient, held charge of the revenue-
collections of the Khalsah (crown lands). With him were in league
Ghulam Muhammad and Kalia Jamidar with two hundred
troopers. Andinarain demured to the payment of the demand,
and prepared to fight. Murshid Quli Khan sent his officer,
Muhammad Jan, with a force to chastise him, Close to Rajbari,!
the contending forces approached each other, and « battle ensued

Ghulam Muhammad Jamadar was killed, whilst Andinarain from
fear of Murshid Quali Khan’s anger slew himself, and his zamindari
was transferred to two Bengal zamindars on the northern side of
the Ganges, named Ram-Jivan * and Kah Kunwar, who were punc-
tual in payments of revenne. When that year came to a close,
and the new year commenced, in the month of Farwardi (corre-
sponding to Asar) weighing the treasures ® Murshid Quli remitted
to the Emperor one kror and three daks of rupees on account of
the Imperial revenue, loading the same on two hundred waggons,

non-Moslems, that is, by Hindus themselves who had embraced the Islamic
religion, namely (1) by Jado aiias King Jallal-nd-din, son of Rajah Kans and
(2) by Murshid Quli Khan, who was himself the son of a Brahmin, I fail to
come across in Bengal history any instance of forcrble conversion of
Hindus in Bengal to the Islamic religion, on the part of any born Musalman
raler or king. Proselytes and converts, nnder all systems of the world’s
religions, are generally more zealous and bigoted than those born and brought
up within their pale. The general insinuation, therefore, agaimst Musal-
men sovereigns and rulers of Bengal that they forcibly converted the Hmdus
to the Islamic religion, seems to be as unfounded as ungenerous. No doubt,
the superior moral influence of Musalman saints, hke Nir Qutb Alim and
others, naturally told on Hindu society (disorganised and demoralised by the
caste-systems of the later days, and shorn of the old Vedantic putity) and
induced portions of its ranks to flock spontaneously to the Moslem creed,
with ita simpler doctrine of Monotheism.

eonvoyed by six hundred cavalry and five hundred infantry. Over
and above this amount, he remitted the profits derived from Jagirs,
together with other fees. And also at the beginning of each year
he sent to the Emperor elephants, Tangan horses, buffaloes,
domesticated deers, and game dressed specially at Jahangirnagar
(Dacca), wolf-leather shields, széal pati mats mounted in gold, and
mosquito curtains! made of Ganga jal* cloth of Sylhet, through
which serpents could not penetrate, together with other rarities,
such as ivory, musk, musical instruments, and European manufac-
tures and presents received from Christians, &c. At the time
of sending the remittance, he used to accompany it on horse-
back together with his staff up to the Suburbs of the City,
and used to have the fact recorded in the Conrt-Record
as wellas in the News-sheet. And the procedure for despatch
of remittances was the following. When the waggons, loaded
with treasure, passed into the limits of another Subah, the Suba-
dar ef that place sending his own men had the waggons of
treasure brought into his fort, and relieving the waggons and
their escorts reloaded the treasure mto fresh waggons, cou-
voyed by fresh escorts furnished by himself. And the same
procedure was adopted by succeeding Subadars, till the trea-
sures with the presents reached the Emperor Aurangzeb. And
when the Khan’s efficient administration met with the approba-
tion of the Emperor, the former received fresh favours from
the Emperor, who raised his rank and bestowed on him the title
of Moatamanu-l-Mulk’Alau-d-daulah Jafar Khan Nasiri Nasir
Jang. He was also rewarded with the personal Mangab of a Huft
Hazari together with the Insignia of the Mah: Order, and was raised
to a higher class of the Peerage. No appointments to offices in
Bengal were made without his advice. And Imperial Mangabdars
hearing that the country of Bengal had been turned into a fertile
garden without thorns, sought for offices in Bengal. Newab
Jafar Khan appointed the applicants to offices under him. One

of these was Nawab Saif Khan! whose application for “appoint-
ment being received through the Emperor, Nawab Jafar Khan
conferred au office on him. A shortaccount of Saif Khan’s caxger
is mentioned in the body of this History. Nawab Saif Khan
was alive till the period of the Nizamat ef Nawab Mahabat Jang.
As he was the scion of a very noble family, he never visited Nawab
Mahabat Jang.4 Although the latter seught for an interview,
Nawab Saif Khan did not visit him. Whenever Nawab Mahabat
Jang whilst out on a hunting excursion went towards Purneah,
Nawab Saif Khan advanced with his troops and blocked his
progress. But whenever Nawab Mahabat Jang had need of
auxiliaries, Saif Khan furnished efficient contingents. After Saif
Khan's death, his son, the Khan Bahadur, sneceeded to the office
of Fanjdar of the tract of Purneah and its environs. Nawab
Mahabat Jang gave in marriage the daughter of Nawab Said
Ahmad Khan Bahadur Saulat Jang, bis nephew, to the Khan
Bahadur,’ but that lady died four days after the wedding. On
account of this, confiscating the treasures and effects of the Khan
Bahadur, Nawab Mahabat Jang kept the latter under surveillance.
The Khan Bahadur of necessity was obliged to mount a horse
and escape to Shah Jahainibid (Delhi). Nawab Mahabat Jang
bestowed the tract of Purneah on Saulat Jang. The latter
proceeding there with a large force, devoted himself to its
administration, and held sway. After Saulet Jang’s death, his
son, Shankat Jang, succeeded him. Nawab Siraju-d-danlah, who
was the latter’s cousin, durmg the period of his Nizamat, killed
Shaukat Jang in battle, and deputing Diwan Mohan Lal, con-
fiscated Shaukait’s treasures and effects. ~

au opportunity to avenge himself on Darab Narain Qanungo,
who, during the Nawab’s incumbency of the office of Diwan,
had declined to sign the accounts. Inasmuch as the office
of Qanungo corresponded to the office of Registrar of the Con-
quered dominions, and the Diwin’s Statements of Account
and Revenue-roll without the Qanungo’s signature were not
accepted by the Central Imperial Diwan, the Nawab sought for an
opportunity to tarnish Darab Narain’s reputation, by doubling the
sphere of Darab Narain’s authority over the affairs of adminia-
tration. With this object in view, the Nawab entrusted to him
control over the affairs of the Khalsah (crown lands). And
when Diwan Bhupat Rai, who had come with the Nawab from
the Imperial Camp, died, and his son, Gulab Rai, could not satis-
factorily discharge the duties of the office of Diwan, the office
of Peskkar of the Khalgah was also bestowed on Darab Narain.
And leaving to his control the Assessment and Collection of the
revenue and other Financial and Internal affairs, the Nawab
made him supreme. Although the abovementioned Qanungo by
minute attention to details raised the Revenue of the Khalsah
(crown lands) to one kror and fifty lakhs, made Revenue Collec-
tions, and under every Head of Income shewed cousiderable in-
creage, and presented a Budget with a larger Surplus of Imperial
Revenue than before, still the Nawab, gradually wresting authority
from him, imprisoned him together with the Statements of
Accounts and Estate-ledgers, and employing various tortures killed
him. And he allotted ten annas of the Qanungo-ship to Darib
Narain’s son, Sheo Narain, and six annas thereof to Jai Narain,
who at the period of the Nawah’s Diwani, when the Nawab was
setting out for the Imperial Camp, had shewn good-will, and had
signed the Nawab’s Statements of Accounts. And dismissing
Zaau-d-din Khan, Fanjdar of Hughli,! he with the Emperor’s sanc-
tion brought the Faujdari of that Port under his immediate autho-

chants, see Wilson’s Annals, Vol. I, pp 301, 299, 298, 297, 290,268 The
English merchants secured a great patron m Ziau-d-din, who was appointed

rity as an appendage to the Nizamat, and appointed Wali Beg
on his own authority as Faujdar of that place. The above-
mentioned Khan, on the arrival of Wali Beg, relinquishing the
fort, came out of the town to set out for the Imperial Capital.
Wali Beg summoned to himself Kankar Sen Bengali, who w:

Peghkar of the dismissed Fanjdar, for submission of pap

relating to receipts of revenue and the office-records, together.
with the clerks aud subordinata officers of the office of Faujdar.
Ziau-d-din Khao turned to Kanker Sen’s assistance, and thereon
Wali Beg opposed the Khian’s march. In consequence, between
Ziau-d-din Khan and Wah Beg a quarrel ensued, The above-
mentioned Khan with his army, on the field of Chandanagar
(Chandenagore) between Chinsurah and French Qhandanagar,
with the help of the Christian Dutch and French, constructed
redoubts, and prepared to fight. Walf Beg also on the field
of the ‘Idgah,'! on the bank of the tank of Debi Das, to o
distance of one and a half krok, drew up his forces, con-
structed entrenchments, and transmitted an account of the
state of affairs to Nawab Jafar Khan. And both the guondam
and the new Faujdars were busy fighting from behind ther
respective entrenchments, and reviewing their forces. Malla
Jarsam Jirani, Deputy of Ziau-d-din Khan, and Kankar Sen,
secretly obtaining help of guns, gunpowder, and armaments from
the Dutch and French, advanced to the battle-field, and assumed
the offensive. Wal Beg, waiting for auxiliaries, assumed the
defensive. At this juncture, Dalip Singh Hazart with a force of
cavalry and infantry came from Nawab Jafar Khan to the
assistance of Wali Beg, and also brought a mandate containing
threats addressed to the Christians. Ziau-d-din Khan, on the
advice of the Christians, opened negotiations of peace with Dalfp
Singh, and put him off his guard. Harly in the morning, sending
by way of a ruse a false message to Dalip Singh through an agent,
Ziau-d-din Khan instructed the latter to hand the message to
Dalip Singh and to get back the reply, and placing one red. shawl
for recognition on the head of the agent despatched the latter on

882, 829, 341. Murshid Quli got Zian-d-din promptly dismissed in 1711.

his errand. And an English guoner whose aim was unerring
directed a large bronze! gun (the range whereof extended over one
and a half kroh) towards Dalip Singh’s camp, and by means of
a telescope kept in view the agent’s shawl. Arriving at a time
when Dalip Singh was bareheaded and barebodied and was
engaged in rubbing oil in order to bathe, the agent handed the
message to Dalip Singh. Then the gunner directing his aim at
the shawl fired his gun, and the cannon-ball hit Dalip Singh on
the chest and scattered his body to the air. Praise is due to that
unerring magician, for no harm ensued to the agent. Ziau-d-din
Khin rewarding the gunner attacked the enemy’s entrenchment.

Kankar’s past and present misconduct, and outwardly shewing
reconciliation, appointed him to the office of Ohakiahdar of Hugili,
At the close of the year, at the time of anditing the Annual Abstract
Accounts, the Nawab put him in prison on charges of misap-
propriation of the current and arrear revenue collections and sair
duties, and put this cat into breeches, and forced him to swal-
low some laxative, and set on him a harsh collector of revenne. In
the breeches continually easing himself, Kankar died. At that
time Syed Akram. Khan who held the office of Diwan of Bengal
died, and Syed Rezi Khan, husbard of Nafisth Khanam, a
daughter of Shujiu-d-din Muhammad Khan, (Nawab Nazim of
the Subah of Orissa and son-in-law of Nawab Jafar Khin,)' who
was the scion of a leading Syed family of Arabia, was appoint-
ed Diwan of Bengal. And he! was a bigoted ‘and short-tempered
man, and in collection of dues was extremely strict, and by adopting
harsh measures collected the revenue. It is said he prepared a
Reservoir full of filth, and as in the language of the Hindus Para-
Gise is called ‘ Batkant,’ he sneeringly named this Reservoir “ Baik-
ant.” He used to thrust into this Reservoir the defaulting Zamin-
dars: and defaulting Collectors of Revenue. After torturing them
in various ways, and making them undergo various privations,
he used to collect in entirety the arrears. In that year, news of
the insurrection of Sitaram Zamuindar, and of the murder of Mir
Abi Tinab, Faujdir of the Chaklah of Bhusnéh, in the Sarkar
of Mahmidabad, was received. The details éf'thig affair are
as follows:—Sitaram,4 zamindar of Parganah Mahmiadabad,

revolt on the head of vanity. Not submitting to the Vicoroy,
he declined to meet the Imperial officers, and closed against the
latter all the avenues of access to his tract. He pillaged and
raided the lands adjoining to his Zamindari, and also quarrelled
with the Imperial garrisons and Faujdars. Mir Abu Turab,
Fanjdar of the Qhakleh of Bhusnah,! who was the scion of a
leading Syed clan and was closely related to Prince Azimu-gh-
shén and the Timimde Emperors, and who amongst his con-
temporaries and peers was renowned for his learning and ability,
looked down upon Nawab Jafar Khan. Mir Abii Tiirab tried
to capture Sitaram, but was not successful, At length, he
detailed his General, Pir Khin, with 200 cavalry to chastise
Sitarim. On being apprised of this, Sitaram concentrating his
forces lay in ambush to attack the aforesaid General. One day,
Mir Abu Tirib with a uumber of friends and followers went out
for hunting, and in the heat of the chase alighted on Sitaram’s
frontiers, Pir Khan was not in Abi Tirab’s company. The
zamindar (Sitaram) on hearing of this, fancying Mir Abi Tirab
to be Pir Khan, suddenly issued out from the forest with his
forces and attacked Mir Abii Tiiréb from the rear. Although
the latter with a loud voice announced his name, Sitaram not
heeding it inflicted wounds on Abi Tiiréb with bamboo-clubs,
and felled him from his horse. When this news reached Nawab
Jafer Khan, his body trembled from fear of the Emperor’s resent-
ment. Appointing Hasan Ali Khan who had married Nawab
Jafar Khan's wife's sister and was descended from a noble family
to be Faujdar of Bhisnah, and supporting him with an efficient
force, Nawab Jafar Khan directed him to capture that trouble-
some villain (Sitaram). The Nawab issued mandates to the
Zamindars of the environs insisting on their not suffering Sitaram
to escape across their frontiers, and also threatening that should
the latter effect his escape across the frontiers of any one, not only
he would be ousted from his Zamindari, but be punished, The
Zamindars from all sides hemmed him in, when Hasan Ali Khan
arrived and captured Sitaram together with his women and

children, confederates and adherents, and sent them with chains
round their necks and hands to Nawab Jafar Khan. The Nawab
enclosing Sitaram’s face in cow-hide had him drawn to the gallows
in the eastern suburbs of Mirghidabid on the high-way leading to
Jahangirnagar and Mahmidabad, and imprisoned for life Sitaram’s
women and children and companions. Bestowing his Zamindari
on Rim Jivin, the Nawab confiscated to the State Sitaram’s
treasures and effects, and extirpating his family, root and branch,
he sent an account of the affair to the Emperor. As the Em-
perort Aurangzeb ‘Alamgir had died in the Dakhin on Friday,
28th of Zilgidh 1119 A.H., Muhammad Mu‘azzam Shah ‘Alim
Bahadir Shah* ascended the Imperial throne of Delhi.
Nawab Jafar Khan sent presents with the tribute of Bengal, and
received an Imperial Patent confirming him in the Viceroyalty
of Bengal. The Nawab was also honoured with the gift of a
Hhillat including a fringed palanquin. Prince Azimu-sh-Shan,
leaving Sar-bland Khan as Ins Deputy at ‘Azimabad, set ont for
the Imperial Capital. And that very year Sultan Farrukh-sir,
prior to the accession of Bahadur Shah, came to Murshidabad
from Jahangirnagar (Dacca) at the invitation of Nawab Jafar
Khan, and put up at the L‘al Bagh palace. The above-mentioned
Nawab, paying proper deference to the princely rank of his
guest, rendered him due services, and defrayed the expenses of
the Prince and his household ; whilst according to the established
practice he remitted the Revenue with the tribute to the Emperor
Bahadur Shah. After areign of five years and one month, in
the year 1124 A.H., Emperor Bahadur Shah died, and his eldest
son, Sultan Mazii-d-din, under the title of Jabindar Shah,’
became Emperor, and in concert with his two younger brothers

1 Emperor Aurangzeb died in the 52nd year of his reign, ot the age of
ninety-one, in 1118 AH. or 1707 AC. at Ahmadnagar, and was buried at
Aurangabad. See Seir Vol II, p. 875, and KhafiKhan. He left the following
sons :—Mubhammad Muazzam (at Kabul), 2, Muhamad Azam (at Malwah) 3,
Kam Bakhsh (at Bijapur.)

According to the established practice, the new Emperorsent message
of confirmation to Nawab Jafar Khan. The aforesaid Khan,
shewing submission, remitted presents and tribute to the Hmperor.
In order to assert his claim to the Imperial throne, Sultan
Farrukh-sir, the second son of Prince ‘Azimu-gsh-Shan, who resided
in the Province of Bengal as Deputy Nazim of the Snbah resolved
to fight with Sultan Mazu-d-din, planned to start for Shahjahana-
bad (Delhi), and demanded money and troops from Nawab Jafar
Khan. The latter gave the following straightforward answer :
“Tas an Iinperial servant am subjéct to the Crown and Throne of
the Sovereign of the Imperial Capital. To submit to any one save
and except the person who descended from the Timiride House sits
on the Throne of-the Hmpure of Delhi, would be an act of treachery.
Since M‘azii-d-din, your uncle, is in possession of the Orown
and the Throne, the Imperial revenue cannot be paid to you.”
Despairing of obtaining the treasures and troops of Bengal, but
remembering the injunction in the Qoran “I put my trust in my
Lord God” Farrukh-sir took heart,§ and marched out with a small
force of old and new comrades who were in his company, on an

lady, and when Farrukh-sir contemplated flight across the sea, she inepired

expedition against Sultan M‘azu-d-din. Summuiing his own
army'and artillery from Jahingirnagar, Farrukh-sir set out for
Shahjah@nabad, and by the time he arrived at ‘Azimabad
(Patna) a large army collected under him Levying money in the
way of tax from the bankers of that town, he reduced the
Subah of Behar to his subjection. Collecting paraphernalia of
royalty, he mounted the throne, and unfurling the Imperial Umbrella
lie whirled 1t over his head. Raising the standard of march from
Patna with Royal pomp and splendour, he cast the shadow of
peace and tranquillity on the residents of Banaras. And raising
a loan of one kror ofrupees on the security of the Empire from
Nagar Set and other leading bankers of Banares, he raised a levy
of efficient troops. Syed Abdallah Khan and Syed Husain Ali
Khan,! the two Syed brothers of Barh&, who were Nazims of the
Subéhs of Oudh and Allahabad and were matchless in conrage and
heroism had been dismissed by Sultan M‘azii-d-din, and conse-
quently were smarting under # sense of wrong. They, therefore,
espoused the cause of Sulfin Farrukh-sir, and tied the girdle of
devotion and self-sacrifice to the waists of their hearts. And in-
tercepting the treasure from Bengal remitted by Nawab Jafar
‘Khan, which owing to the revolution in government Shijan-d-din
Mihammid Khan, Darogha of Allahabad (unyoking the bullocks
in the garden of the town) guarded with 300 troops, Farrukh-sir
detailed a large force to guard it. Having satisfied himself about
the security of the treasure amd the efficiency-of the force which
he had detached to guard it, Farrukh-sir bestowed the office of
Vizerat on Syed Husain Ali Khan, and had the Khutbah of sover-
eignty recited after his own name. “When God wills a thing,
the conditions for its accomplishment are also provided.” As
Farrukh-sir was displeased with Jafar Khan, he appointed
Rashid Khan,* elder brother of Afrasiab Khan Mirzai-Ajmiri,
who was the scion of an ancient and noble family of Bengal
and was brought up in the Imperial household, and who in physi-
cal prowess was equal to a Rustam or an Isfandiar, and who
used to burl down rogu- elephants—to supersede Jafar Khan in
the Subahdari of Bengal. It is said that when Sultan Farrnkh-

set out from Akbarnagar (Rajmahal) towards ‘Azimabad

(Patna), the cannon of Malik Maidan! which required a maund
weight of cannon-ball and 150 bullocks and two elephants to
move it, was stuck in the mud in a hollow ditch near Sakrigali.
Although an attempt was made to drag it out with the help of
bullocks and elephants, it could not be moved. Farrukh-sir himself
going up to the cannon brought into requisition the ingenuity
of Christian gunners, but even that was of no avail. Mirza-i-
Ajmiri making his obeisance, said: “If ordered, thy slave might
try his strength.” The Sultan gave permission. Mir2a-i-Ajmiri,
tying the hem of his garment round his waist and putting both of
his hands heneath the cannon-frame, lifted up the cannon together
with its frame on his chest, and said “ wherever orde.ed, I will put
it.’ The Sultan ordered it to be placed on a high ground. The
Mirza removed the cannon from the ditch to a high ground. From
the strain of his physical power, drops of blood were about to ooze
out from his eyes. The Sultin applanded him whilst the assembly,
sent up shouts of praise and choruses of applause to the skies.
The Mirza at that very moment was rewarded with the mangab
of a Sik hestri together with the title of Afrasiab Khan.
Rashid Khan set out with a large army for Bengal, and entered it
vid the passes of Tiliagadhi and Sakrigali, On hearing the news
of his entry, Jafar Khan shewed no signs of anxiety. Besides the
regular war-establishment of thé Subah he mobilised no extra
troops. Rashid Khan reaching three kroh distant from Murshidabad
arrayed his troops for battle. Next morning, Nawab Jafar Khan
detailed Mir Bangali and Syed Anwar Jaunpuri with two thousand
cavalry and infantry to encounter Raghid Khan, whilst the Nawab
himaelf, according to his daily practice, set to copying the Quran.
When the two forces encountered each other, a battle ensued.
Syed Anwar, in the thick of the fight, was killed, but Mir Bangali,
with a small force, bravely stood his gronnd on the baittle-field,
till the army of Rashid Khan surrounded him from all sides.
Although these tidings reached Nawab Jafar Khan, the latter
remained unconcerned and quietly went on with his work of
copying the Quran. At last the news of Mir Bangali’s retreat
arrived. It was then that the Nawab detached his special
disciple, Muhammad Khan, who was Faujdar of Murghidabad and

1 He was apparently a Turk, ag the iitle Malik wonld indicate, but I cannot
trace who this notable was,


--- Page 298 ---
271

an Officer of the Army, to reinforce Mir Bangali. The former
with the swiftness of lightning and breeze joined Mir Bangali, and
threw in the auxiliaries. Subsequently, Nawab Jafar Khan,
after having fimshed his work of copying the Quran, recited
the Fatiha-t-Khair and armed himself for battle. And mounting
an elephant, with a force of cavalry and a retinue consisting of
kinsmen and Turkish, Georgian and Abyssinian servants he
encountered Rashid Khan on the field of Karimahad outside the
City, and commenced chanting the Duai-Seifi! It is said that he
had so persistently practised the Duai-Saifi, that when he
commenced chanting 1t his sword of itself unsheathed itself from
its seabbard. and throngh invisible help he vanquished the
enemy. On the arrival of Jafar Khan, the courage and. boldness of
Mir Bangali and his army increased ten-fold and hundred-fold.
With his clamorous force Mir Bangali attacked the centre of the
euemy. Rashid Khan, who considered Jafar Khan no match for
himself, swaggering of swordmanship and his capacity to easily
rout the enemy, mounted a rogue elephant, and charged Mir
Bangali who was inthe van. The aforesaid Mir who was an
unerring marksman

Placed a wooden arrow in his bow-string,

And stretched his bow, and extended his arm-pit.

When the arrow-notch came up to his ear,

He shot the arrow straight at the struggling enemy.

As luck would have it, the arrow hit the enemy on the
forehead,

And pierced right through the hind-head,

That leader of the heroes was pierced by the arrow:

That brave-lion rolled on the elephant,

At that juncture, the troops forming a solid column,

Made one united rush at the enemy.

The ground waa trodden down into furrows by horses’ hoofs,

The sky was cut to pieces by cannons and spears,

With swords, daggers, iron-maces and spears,

They charged the enemy.

: Owing to profuse shedding of blood on that battle-field,
The whole face of the earth looked crimson.
A: whole world was consigned to destruction,
If any one survived, he was imprisoned,
The enemy’s treasures and effects were looted,
Jafar Khan won a glorious victory.

Nawab Jafar Khan returning triumphant caused the music of
victory to be struck up, entered the Fort, and ordered that a
minaret should be raised entombing the heads of the slain on the
highway leading towards Hindustan, so that it might serve as
a warning to others. The prisoners of Rashid Khan’s army said
that on the advance of Jafar Khan green-dressed soldiers with
drawn swords descended from the clouds, attacked the foree of
Rashid Khan, and afterwaids vanished. Sultén Farrukh-sir who
had not yet finished settling his accounts with Sultin M‘azu-d-
din, on the way receiving news of-Jdafar Khin’s victory and
Rashid Khan's defeat was depressed. In short, when near Akbara-
bad (Agra)a battle! ensued between Farrukh-sir and Sultan M‘azu-d-
din Jahaindir Shah, the Syeds of Barha,* on the side of Muham-
mad Farrukh-sr, displaying self-sacrifice, exhibited heroic valour.
On the side of M‘azu-d-din, Khan Jahan Bahadur Kokaltagh
Khan, who was the Pay-Master General of the Army, was killed,
owing to the carelessness of the Amirn-l-Umara Zu-l-faqir, Khan.3
And M’azu-d-din’s other noblemen, especially the Mughal noblemen,
being in conspiracy with the noblemen of Farrukh-sir, exhibited
treachery during the battle. In consequence, great confusion,
arose in the army of M'‘azu-d-din Jahindaér Shab. Becoming
depressed by observing the fate of Khan Jahan Bab&dur, Jahandar

ACCESSION OF SULTAN FARRUKH-SIR TO THE
THRONE OF DELHI.

On hearing of the accession of Emperor Farrukh-sir, Nawab
Jafar Khan sent presents and tribute, and remitted the entire
balance of the Imperial revenue. In return, the Nawab received
patents confirming him in the united offices® of the Nizgamat and
Dewani of the three Subahs of Bengal, Behar, and Orissa. The
Nawab was also recipient of a rich Khilat. The Nawab's repre-
sentations to the new Emperor continued to receive attentive
consideration, as during former regimes. The Nawab became an
object of-envy to his contemporaries and peers. For instance,
on Jafar Khan’s representation to the Emperor, Nagar Set’s uncle

1 His name was Muhammad Ibrahim, and his titles were Asifu-d-daulah
Jumlatol-Mulk Asad Khin, He was related by marriage to Emmou-d-danlah
Asaf Khan, and became Prime Minister under Emperor Aurangzeb. (See
his life in Maastr-wl-Umara, Vol. I, p. 810, and in Seir, Vol. II, p. 406.) He
was a statesman of eminence and sagacity. On his son, Zulfuqgqar Khin's
assassination, he composed the following pathetio epitaph :—

keeping the two offices distinct, in that it encouraged late: on tha growth of

and agent, Fateh Ghand Sahu, whose services had won the good
graces of the Khan, was invested with the title of Jagat Set, and
appointed to the office of Treasurer-General of Bengal. Syed
Hosain ‘Ali Khan, the Paymaster-General, who was a brother
of Qutb-ul-Mulk ‘Abdullah Khan Vazir, aspired after the title of
Nasirjang, which title Jafar Khan held. As it was not consonant
with the Imperial reguiations that two persons should simultane-
ously hold one title, an Imperial mandate was issued to Jafar Khan,
suggesting an exchange of titles. Although the Syed brothers were
personages of immense influence and power, Jafar Khan resented
their 1mpudence, declined to exchange his title, and sent the follow-
ing manly reply to the Emperor; “ This old servant has no hanker-
ing after names or titles ; but the title which it pleased the late
Emperor ‘Alamgir (Aurangzeb) to confer on him, he declines to
barter” When Syed Razi Khan died, at the desire of Jafar Khan,
Emperor Farrukh-sir conferred the Diwani of the Subah of Bengal on
Mirza Asadu-l-léh, son of Shuja‘u-d-din Muhammad Khan, Nazim
of Orissa, by the daughter of Jafar Khan, bestowing at the same
time ou the Mirza the title of Sarfariz Khan. As Jafar Khan
had no son, and Sarfariz Khan was his maternal grandson,
shewing foresight, he purchased from the income of his personal
jogir the zamindari of Qismat Chunahkhali in Parganah Kholhar-
bah in the district of Murghidabad from Muhammad Aman, the
Talugdar of the aforesaid Qismat, in the name of Mirza Asadu-l-
lib Sarfaraz Khan, named the said zamindari Asadnagar, and cansed
it to be entered in the Imperial and Provincial Qaénungo’s registers.
This estate came to be known a8 Khas Talnq, so that after his death
it might afford subsistence to his descendants, and after the pay-
ment of revenne from its income its surplus might be at their
disposal. And in the same year, the Deputy Governorship of
Jahangirnagar (Dacca) was bestowed on Mirz& Lutfn-l-lah, a son-
in-law of Shuja‘u-d-din Muhammad Khan. The Mirzi at the
same time received the title of Murshid Quh Khan. In that on the
9th Rabiu-l-Sani 1181 A.H. the Emperor Farrukh-sir was slain,

1 Between Farrukh-sir and the Syed brothers, ill-feeling broke out
through the instigation of one Mur Jumla (who possessed great influence over
Farrukh-sir, having been Qazi of Dacca, when Farrukh-sir was there as
Deputy Nazim) This ill-feeling was fanned by Ratan Qhand, the crafty
Diwan of the Vazir Qutb-ul-Mulk Syed Abdullah, brother of Syed Husain
Ali Khan. Thus ill-fecling which not only paralysed the Administration,

through the treachery of ‘Abdullah Khan the Visir and Husain
‘Ali Khan, the Paymaster-General, the Syeds of Barha raised
Sultan Rafi‘n-d-darajat,1 son of Prince Rafi‘u-sh-shin, son of
Bahadur Shah, to the throne. Yor four or five months, ruling
nominally, this Emperor died of consamption. After this, Rafi‘u-
d-darajat’s second brother, named Sultg fi'u-d-daulah,? was
brought out from captivity, and placed 3 throne, and was
styled Shah Jahan the Second, The latter also, like his elder
brother, for Sve or six months sat nominally on the throne. At
the time when the Imperial army was engaged in repelling Sultan
Neko Sir, son of Sultan Akbar, and grandson of Emperor
Alamgir, who had invaded Akbarabid (Agra), Shah Jahan
the Second also died And the Syeds of Barha and other
Imperial noblemen, at the end of the year 1131 A.H., bringing
out Sultan Raushan Akhtar, son of Jahan Shah, from the citadel
of Shahjahanabad (Delhi), and marching with him day and night,

in return patents confirming him in his former offices, and adding
thereto the Subahdari of Orissa. In short, owing to the undue
influence exercised over the administration by Syeds Husain ‘Ali
Khan and ‘Abdu-l-lah Khan from the reign of Farrukh-sir till
that period, the affairs of the Empire had suffered much in eclat,
and owing to constant changes in Emperors the administration of
the country had fallen into chaog. The people of Bengal
were, however, free from the troubles incidental to revolutions
in the kingly office, as Jafar Khan ruled over that Province with
great’ vigour. In his time no harm ensued to Bengal at
the hands of the Mahrattas. The Christian Danes who had no
factory in Bengal, and carried on commercial transactions through
the agency of the French, with the advice of the latter, offering
nazar, applied for permission to erect a factory at Bangibazar.!
Obtaining sanad from Nawab Jafar Khan, they erected mud-walled
houses, established themselves there, and laid the foundation of a
factory with strong towers, surrounded by a deep and broad moat,
into which the river water flowed, and wherein sloops could move
about. Working day and night, and spending much money, they
set about building the same. Placing obliquely the cap of vanity
on the head of pride, they gave themselves airs at the expense of
other Christian nationalities, and bragged they would sell woollen-
stuffs, velvet, and silk-stuffe® at the rate of gunny-cloth.8 The
English and Dutch Christians, seeing the loss in their own markets,

conspired to have the former's factory closed; intrigued with thé

accounts of their having erected forts and towers ‘with moats at
Bangibazar, and of their past misdeeds in the Emperor’s domin«
ions, they induced Ahsanu-l-lah Khan to write to Nawab Jafar
Khan, and themselves petitioned the latter to issue mandates in the
name of the above Faujdar to close the factory of the Danos. Al-
though Ahsinu-l-lah Khan sent agents to close the factory, the
Danes not relying on their message, failed to close theix factory ;
at length the Faujdar deputed his own Deputy, named Mir
Jafar, to the Danes, The Chief of the Danes, who was styled
a General, mounted cannons on the heights of the ramparts;
and prepared to fight. The aforesaid Mir, erecting entrenchments
facing the ramparts, commenced fighting with cannons, rockets,
arrows, and muskets. But the soldiers of the Mir could not ap-
proach the factory, owing to constant shower of cannon-halls and
rockets. And the ways for the ingress and egress of the vessela of
merchants in the river became closed. The Christian French
secretly leagued with the Danes and assisted the latter with sup-
plies of shot, powder, and armaments. The Danes captured, with
the secret help of the French, Khwijah Muhammad Kamil, eldest
son of Khwajah Muhammad Fazal, who happened to pasg and
repass the river by boat. Owing to this, all the Mughal, Armenian,
and other merchants made great exertions to effect his release,
and fearing lest he might be slain, for two or three days a truce
wag arranged, The aforessid Khwijah, agreeing to pay a large
ransom, 2nd also promising to bring about peace, was released
from the custody of, the Danes. Then the Christian French,
dreading the resentment of the Faujdar, deserted the Danes.
Mir Jafar,. advancing his entrenchments, with volleys of: cannon.
balla, , rockets, arrows, and musket-balls, reduced the garrison
to straits, and ent, off, all supplies both by land and -by water.
When the garrison,were reduced fo starvation, their Indian
servants all fled, and the General alone with thirteen Danes remained
in the factory. Though reduced to such straits and, numbers,

they with their own hands kept up a perpetual shower of
cannon-balls and rockets, and allowed no opportunity to the
attacking force to lift up their heads, and far less to
advance out of their entrenchments or to assault the factory.
For some time the fighting continued in this wise. By
chance, a cannon-ball discharged from Mir Jafar’s entrenchment
hit the Danish General on the mght arm, and broke it, and his hand
became in consequence useless. The General! was obliged, in conse-
quence, at dead of night, to scuttle out of the factory, and, embark-
ing on board a vessel, he set sail for his own native country. Next
morning, the factory was captured; but save and except somecannon-
balls, nothing of value was found. Mir Jafar, rasing the gateway
end the tower of the factory, returned victorious and triumph-
ant. About that time, news arrived that the Afghans, Shuj‘ait
Khan and Nijat Khan, zamindars of Tonki Saribpir,? in the Sarkar
of Mahmiidabad, who were notorious for their lawlessness, had
plundered the revenue of Mahmidabad amounting to sixty thous-
and rupees, whilst on its way to Murghidibad. Nawab Jafar Khan,
who thirsted for the blood of thieves and robbers, hearing this news,
appointed a Superintendent of Dacoity with spies under him, and
after ascertaining the reality and origin of this affair, he issued an
order to Ahsinu-l-lah Khan, Faujdar of the Chaklah of Hughli,
directing their arrest The aforesaid Khin, ostensibly marching
out on a hunting expedition, like a sudden calamity, surprised their
stronghold, arrested and captured all the brigands, pnt them in
chains and fetters, mutilated their hands and feet, tied them
étrongly and securely with pieces of stirrup-leather, and sent them
to Nawab Jafar Khan. The Nawab imprisoned them for life, and
confiscated their treasures, After they were thus banished and
extirpated,’ the Nawab settled their aforesaid zamindaré with Rim
Fivan. Levying indemnity equal to the plundered revenue from
the landholders of the neighbonrhood, the Nawab credited it to the
Tmpoerial treasury. During the Naw4b’s administration, tha names
of free-hooters, night-marauders, and assassins were blotted out
from the annals of the Bengal Satrapy, and the dwellers, both of

towns and villages, lived in perfect peace and comforf. The Thanahs
of Katwah and Murshidganj, on the highway leading to Bardwan,
were established by the Nawab, in the early part of his Nizamat,
whilst he held the title of Murshid Quli Khin. He established
these Thanahs for guarding the above highway, and their
control and administration was entrusted by the Nawab to his
special disciple, Muhammad Jin. In that, in the environs of
Fanachor, which is on the highway leading from Nadia to Hughli,
in the plantain groves thefts took place in bread dayhght,
Muhammad Jan established an outpost at Pipthal, subordinate to
the Lhanah of Katwah. Oapturing the thieves and robbers, and
chopping them into bits, Mubammad Jan hanged them on the
trees of the highway, to serve as warnings to others. As in his
retinue, hatchet-men used to go ahead, he became known as
Muhammad Jan Kolharath. Thieves and robbers used to tremble
on hearing of his name. As a propagator of Muhainmadan
religion, as @ strict observer of the religious injunctions,
as a friend of scions of good family, as a reliever of the
distressed, and as an exterminator of oppressors, Nawab Jafar
Khan was a second Amira-l-Umara Shiaista Khan. He was strict
in the enforcement of his orders, and faithful in the fulfilment
of his engagements. He never neglected saying his daly prayers
five times, and fasted for three months in the year, and used to
completely recite the Qoraz. On the 12th and 13th of the lunar
months, he used to fast, and on Thursday nights he was vigilant
in his prayers. Many nights he used to pass in reciting certain
select portions of the Qordan, and he slept little From morning
to midday, he devoted himself daily to transcribing the Qoran.
And he used to send, every year, copies of the Qoriin transcribed
by bis hand, together with votive offermgs and gifts, through the
headmen of the pilgrims and other caravans bound for pilgrimage,
to Mecca; Medinah, Najaf, Karballa, Baghdid, Khorasan, Jidah,
Bagrah, and other holy places, like Ajmir, Panduah, d&c. For
each of these places, he allotted votive offerings, endowments,
and reciters of the Qorin. The humble author of this History
has seen a torn copy of the Qorfin, every chapter of which was
detached, in the shrine of Hagrat Makhdum Akhi Siraju-d-din, at
S‘adu-l-lahpur) written in large characters in the handwriting

1 I do not know if that copy is still there. See also uote ante.

of Nawab Jafar Khan. The Nawab had in his employ 2,500
reciters of the Qorin, who completely recited the Qoran daily,
and corrected what the Nawab transcribed from the Qoran;
and their meals were supplied twice daily from the Nawfb’s own
kitchen, and comprised game, birds, and other animals. He
shewed a great predilection for the company of Syeds, Shaikhs, the
scholarly, and the pious, and he deemed it meritorious to serve them.
And from the Ist to the 12th of the month of Reabi’:-1-Awwal,
which is the anniversary of the death of the Prophet Muhammad
(Peace be on him'!), daily he used to feed the excellent and the
venerable Shaikhs, the Ulama, the pious saints, and inviting
them from the environs of Murshidabad, he used to receive them
with great respect at his banquets, and till they finished their
dinners, he used to stand before them in a respectful posture, and
to serve them. And every night during that period, from Mahi-
nagar to Lilbigh, on the banks of the river, he used to arrange
illuminations with chiraghs, m an elegaut fashion, so that from the
brightness of the illumination, the altars of the mosques and the
pulpits, with the inscriptions of the Qorin engraved thereon, could
be read from the other side of the river by spectators, to their great
amazement, It is said that he employed more than one lak of
labourers to light the chiraghs under the supervision of Nazir
Ahmad. After sunset, as soon as the gun was fired to signal
that the illumination should commence, all the chiraghs were
simultaneously ht up in one instant, producmg an illusion as if a
sheet of hght had been unrolled, or as if the earth had become a
sky studded with stars. And he constantly consecrated his life
to seck the approbation of his Creator and to seek the well-
being of his subjects, and to redress the grievances of the
oppressed. He used to sign his name with the Shangarfi pen.
He exerted himself to render the prices of food-grains cheap, and
did not allow rich people to hoard up stocks of grains. Every
week, he had the price-current reports of food-grains prepared,
and compared them with the prices actually paid by the poor
people. If these latter were charged one dam over the prices
stated in the price-current reports, he had the dealers, mahaldars,
and weighmen puuished in various forms, and had them patrolled
through the city, placed upon asses. During his administration,
the ruling price of rico was 5 or 6 maunds (of the standard market


--- Page 308 ---
281

weight) per rupee, and other articles were similarly cheap, so
much so that by spending one rupee in a month, people ate poldo and
qahahk daily.! Owing to this cheapness, the poor lived in ease
and comfort. And the captains of ships were not permitted
to export on their vessels food-grains beyond those needed for
actual consumption by those on board the ships. At the period
of disembarkation of ships, the Faujdar of the port of Hughli
deputed to the harbour a Preventive Officer for the inspection and
attachment of the food-grains, in order that no food-grains
beyond what were needed for actual consumption on board the
ships might be exported. And the Nawab had so much reverence
for the Imperial authority, that he never travelled on any of the
Imperial flotilla of boats. In the rainy seasons, when the Im-
perial war-vessels came for review from Jahangirnagar (Dacca)
he used to go up to receive them, and turning his face towards
the Imperial Capital he used to offer his salute and presents. And
in obedience of the Sacred Law he never indulged in intoxicating
liquors, and eschewed things prohibited by the sacred law, neither
he saw dancings nor heard singings. In his whole lifetime, be-
sides his one wedded wife, he kept no mistress, and never bestowed
his attention on any other woman. Owing to his extremely nice
sense of honour, he did not allow eunuchs and women who cannot
be lawfully seen to enter his harem. If a female slave went out
of his harem once, he did not allow her access to the harem again
In every branch of learning, art, and science he had great profi-
ciency. He abstained from delicious and luxurious dishes ; nor did
he taste anything of luxury except ice-water and ice-preserves.
And Khizr Khan, Deputy of Nazir Muhammad, was deputed for
four months in winter to the mountains of Akbarnagar for storing
ice, The Nuwab had stores of ice full for twelve months, used ice
daily and received his supplies of icefrom Akbarnagar. Similarly,
ju the season of mango-fruit, which is the best of the fruits* of
Bengal, the Superintendent of mango-supplies was posted in the

Chaklah of Akbarnagar, and he, counting the mangoes of the
Khas trees, entered them im the accounts, and shewed their collec-
tion and disposal, and the watchmen and carriers, levying the
expenses of carriage from the zamindars, sent the sweet and deli-
cious mangoes from Maldih, Katwih, Husainpar, Akbarnagar, and
other places. And the zamindars had no power to cut down the
Khag mango-trees; on the contrary, the mangoes of all the gardens
of the aforesaid Chaklah were attached. And this practice was
more 1igorously observed in the times of previous Nazims of
Bengal. Hven at present,! when the administration of Bengal is
virtually in the hands of the Christian English, and only the
nominal Nizimat rests with Nawab Mubiraku-d-danlah, son of
Nawab J‘afar Ali Khan,? in the mango-season the Superintendent
of the Kha, mangoes proceeds to Maldah on behalf of the aforesaid
Nawab Mubaraku-d-daulah, attaches the mangoes of the Khas
trees, and sends them to the Nawib, and the zamindars do not
go near the Khas mango-trees. But the Superintendent no longer
obtains the carriage expense from the Zamindars, nor does he enjoy
his former prestige and reapect, The roots of oppression were so
thoroughly extirpated in the time of Nawab J‘afar Khan, that
the agents of zamindars used to loiter about—from the Nagar
Khanah to the Qhehal satun,' in quest of the oppressed and of com-
plainants. Wherever they came across an oppressed man or a com-
plamant, they amicably settled matters with him, and did not leave
him to complain to the Nawab And if the officers of the Courts of
justice showed partiality towards the oppressors, and if the oppress-
ed carried therr complaints to the Nawab, the latter instantly re-
dvessed their grievances In admimstering justice, he did not allow
consideration and partiality to be shewn to anyone; he weighed
the high and the low evenly in the scale of justice. For instance,
itis well known that to avenge the death of an oppressed man, he
éxecuted Ins own son,’ and obtained the title of “‘Ad@laé Gastar” (or
Justice-Stiewet). He used to dispense justice, basing his orders

on the injunction of the Qoran, and on the expounding of the law
by Qazi Muhammad Sharf, who had been appointed to the office of
Qazi by Emperor Aurangzeb, and who was an upright judge and a
great scholar, free from hypocrisy. [t is related that a mendicant
at Chunikhali begged for alms from Bindraban, the Talgqudar.
The latter got annoyed, and turned him out from his house. The
mendicant on his (Bindraban’s) ronte of passage collected some
bricks, laid them one over the other like the foundation
of a wall, and named it a mosque, and shouted out the call to
prayer, and whenever the palanqnin of Bindraban passed that way,
he shouted ont still more loudly the call to prayer. Bmdrabaa,
becoming annoyed by this, threw down some brickbats from
that foundation, and abusing the mendicant drove the latter
from that place. The mendicant lodged a complaint at the
Court of justice of Nawab J‘afar Khan. Qézi Muhammad Sharf,
with the concurrence of other Ulama, acting on the injunction
of the sacred Law, ordered the execution of Bindraban.
J‘afar Khan, not acqniescing in the sentence of execution,
enquired thus from the Qizi as to whether he could be let
of: ‘Can in any way this Hindu be saved fiom the. death-
sentence?’ The Qfzi replied ‘Only so much interval may
be allowed in the execution of his death-sentence as may be
taken up in the execution of his mterceder; after that, he
must be execated.”! Priuce ‘Azimnu-sh-shan also interceded for
Bindraban; but that, too, was of no avail. The Qazi killed him
by shooting him with an arrow with his own hand. Azimu-
gh-ghian wrote to Emperor Aurangzeb as follows: “ Qazi Maha-
mmad Shirt has turned mad; for nothing he has killed Bindra-
ban with Ins own hand” The Emperor remarked on the report
ef the Prince this: “This is a gross? calumny; the Qazi is on

the side of God.” Till the close of the reign of Emperor Aurang-
zeb, Qiz: Sharf continued to hold the office of Qazi. On the
death of the Emperor, the Qazi resigned his office; though J‘afar
Khan pressed him to continue, he did not. And during the reign
of Emperor Aurangzeb and during the Nizdmat of J‘afar Khan,
only the nobility, the scholars, the learned, and the excellent
who passed examinations were appointed to the officeof Qazi, which
was never bestowed on the illiterate or the low. No changes or
transfers in the offices of the pious and hereditary Qazis existed,
nor was any tax levied from them ; in fact, they were subordinates
to no superiors, nor answerable to any. For instance, Ahsanv-l-
lah Khan, Faujdar of the port of Hughli, grandson of Bagir Khan,
the Senior (after whom a kind of Indian bread has acquired the
name of Bagir Khani), was a protege of Nawab J‘afar Khan, and
he possessed great influence with the Nawab. During his adminis-
tration, Imamu-d-din, Kotwal (Police Superintendent) of the port
of Hughli, who had acquired a high position and much influence,
enticed away the daughter of 2 Mughal from the latter's house. The
aforesaid Ahsanu-l-18 Khan, conniving at this offence, shewed par-
tiality towards his Kotwal, and stood surety for his fature good
behaviour. The Mughals carried their complaint to Nawab J‘afar
Khan. The Nawab, according to the mjunctions of the Holy Book,
had the Kotwal stoned to death, and did not listen to the inter.
cession of Ahsano-l-lah Khan for the offender. Towards the close
of his career, on the eastern plain of the city of Murghidabad, on
the grounds of his Khas T‘alug, the Nawab erected a Treasury, a
Katrah, » Cathedral mosque, » monument, a Reservoir, and also
sank a large well, and under the staircase of the mosque, he located
his own tomb, so that it might be safe from damage, and might
also, owing to the proximity of the mosque, be blessed with perpetual
benedictions for his soul. When his life drew to its close, finding
that he bad no son, he proclaimed Sarfaraz Khan, who was his
maternal grandson, and who had been brought up by him, as his
heir and successor, and he entrusted to him charge of the treasures

they were not subordinate to any except the Law itself, and their offices

Shajau-d-din marched with a large army towards Bengal In
order to obtain the Imperial Sanad of the Nig&mat of Bengal, and
in order to secure the support of the Imperial Ministers, he sent
a message to Rai Balkishan, agent of Nawab Ja‘far Khan, at the
Imperial Court, who enjoyed more confidence and eminence than
Ja‘far Khan’s other agents. He also sent messages to other
agents of his own.

Emperor Muhammad Shah,! on receiving news of Nawab Ja‘tar
Khan's death, had conferred the Saébahdari of Bengal on Amiru-l-
Umara Samgimu-d-daulah Khan-i-Daman® Khan Bahidur, Chief
Pay-Master-General of the Army. The latter was Emperor's
loyal friend and intimate associate both m social gaieties as well as
in State deliberations, and was his comrade, companion, and coun-
cillor in matters pertaining to feasts, as well as to wars. The
Amiru-l-Umara misled by the intrignes of the aforesaid agent,
sent the patent and Khila‘t of the Deputy Nizamat of Bengal in
the name of Shujau-d-din Muhammad Khan. Shujau-d-din
Khan had reached this side of Medupiir, when the patent address-
ed to his name arrived, and viewing this event as a good omen, he
named that place “ Mubarak-Manzil” or“ the Auspicious place, ”
and ordered a Katrah (a Tower) and a masenry-built Caravanserad
to be erected there. When news of the approach of his fatherreached

Sarfaraz Khan, owing to recklessness of youth, the latter intended
marching to Katwah, in order to oppose his father’s advance. The
Dowager Begam of Nawab Ja‘far Khan, who was avery wise and
sagacious lady, and who regarded Sarfariz Khan as dearer than
her own life, dissuaded the latter, and with soft and sweet words
of counsel set his mind at ease. She said to Sarfaradz Khan:
“Your father is old; after him, the Subahdari as well as the coun-
try with its treasures would devolveon you. To fight against one’s
own father, is cause of loss both in this world and in the next, as well
asofignominy. It is meet that till the hfetime of your father,
you should remain contented with the Diwdanit of Bengal.” Sar-
faraz Khan, who never acted against the advice of his grand-mother,
acquiesced in her counsel. Advancing, he received Shujau-d-din
Muhammad Khan, and escorted him to Murshidabad. Making over
to his father the Fort and the offices of the Nizimat, Sarfariz Khan
retired to his private residence at Naktakhali. From there he used
to attend daily on his father, and spend his time according to the
latter’s wishes. Retaining in his own service the Qoran-readers,
hymn-reciters, and scholars belonging to Nawab Ja‘far Khan's
household, Sarfariz Khan employed them on devotions and on re-
citations of the Qordn, as was the practice under Nawab Ja‘far
Khan. He further consecrated his life to winning the hearts of
people, and also sought for help and blessings from saints and
hermits, ¥~

memory of Nawab Shujinu-d-din Khan, and styles him a second Nanshirvan in
jastice and liberality. He treated all his officers, high and low, including sol-
diers and household servants, with affability and considerateness, and at the
time of his death, begged their forgiveness, and gave them all two months’
pay in advance, In the administration of justice, he was very impartial and
made no difference between Ins own son and his humblest subject. He
appreciated talent, and during his administration, people possessed of the
east talent flocked mto Bengal from all parts of Hindustan, and found a
ready friend and helper in him. Bengal which enjoyed the title of ‘ Jinnatu-
1-Bilad’ or ‘ Paradise of Provinces,’ now hterally became so, under Shujau-
d-din Khin’s wise and beneficent administration His charities were unos-
tentations and catholic, and his hberality was unstinted. His subjects, dur-
jug his administration, enjoyed perfect peace and happiness See Serru-l-

courage was unique in his day, and who in point of liberality and
generosity was matchless in his time, was born at Burhanpir.!
As he ascended the masnad of the Nigamat of Bengal in his old age,
he felt compassion for the condition of the Bengal Zamindars, who
being in duress from the time of Nawab Ja‘far Khan had never,
even in dreams, beheld the faces of ther wives and children. He
set them at large, and permitted them to return to their homes,
after levying from them Nazars over and above the amounis of
revenue assessed by Nawab Ja‘far Khan. By this stroke of policy,
over and above the profits of Jdgis and fees on ware-houses and
factories, he easily raised one kor and fifty laks of rupees, which
he remitted to the Imperial Treasury through the Banking Agency
of Jagat Seth Fatih Chand. And selling off at fancy prices
to Zamindars the jaded horses, cattle, and other live-stovk, as
well as damaged carpets and curtains belonging to the private
estate of Nawab Ja‘far Khan, he sent another forty laks of rupees,
besides elephants, to Hmperor Muhammad Shah. And after the
Abstract Balance-sheet of the Annual Accounts was prepared, he
remitted to the Imperial Capital the svipulated annual tribute of the
Nizimat, besides the Imperial Revenue, according to the established
usage. And sending to the Emperor, at their proper seasons, ele-
phants, U”ingan horses, special cotton-fabrics,? and gishkhana ® and

his successor, Shujdu-d-din Khin (whilst the whole of Upper India was con-
vulsed and torn by fratricidal wars and foreign invasions which converted
thoso fair regions into human shambles), would in a large measure account
for the existence of a comparatively large Musalman population in Bengal,
contrasted with that in Upper India, without having recourse to theories
of a more or less fanciful character, for which there appears little or no
historical warrant,

firmed in the office of Nazim of Bengal. He surpassed his pre-
decessors in office in paraphernalia of 1oyalty and armaments, aud
though his prime of life had passed, he did not scorn life’s plea-

God, he uprooted from his realm the foundations of oppressions and
tyrannies. Executing Nazir Ahmad and Murid Farragh, the
employés of Nawab Ja‘far Khan, who were notorious for their high-
handedness, he confiscated their effects. Nazir Ahmad had laid the
foundation of a Mosque with a garden at Dehpara on the banks of
the river Bhagirati. Shuja‘n-d-daulah, after executing him, finished
the mosque and garden, and named them after himself. And he
tastefully embellished the garden by building therein grand palaces
with reservoirs, canals and numerous fountains. It was a
splendid gaiden, compared with which the spring-houses of Kagh-
mir paled like withering autumn-gaidens; nay, the garden of
Tram! itself seemed to draw its inspiration of freshness and sweet-
ness from it, Shuja‘u-d-daulah used frequently to resort for pro-
menades and picnics to that paradise-like garden, and held thero
pleasure-parties and other entertainments. Every year in that
beautiful garden, he used to give a State Banquet to the educated
section® of his State Officers. It is said that owing to the superb
charmfulness of that garden, Fairies used to come down there for
pienies and walks, and to bathe in its tanks. The guards on get-
ting scent of this, informed Shuja‘u-d-daulah Dreading mischief
from the genii, the Nawab filled up the tanks with earth, and dis-
continued his picnics in that garden.

Being fond of ease and pleasures, Nawab Shuja‘u-d-daulah en-

popularity but also an increase to the revenue (as Nazar was levied), and at
the same time contributed to the fertihty of Bengal, the Jinnatu-l-Biulad. (See
Sewru-l-Mutakherwn, Vol, II, p. 478). For purposes of administration, he main-
tained his son Sarfaraz Khan as the nominal Diwan of Bengal, conferred tho

1 This preference of personal pleasures to the performance of public duties by
the later Mughal pro-consuls and sovereigns of the 18th centul y, marks a sad moral
collapse, and was one of the causes that hastened the downfall cf the Great
Mughal Empire in India. Preferring their own personal ease and pleasures, these
later Moslem Satraps and Emperors delegated the unchecked control of their
State concerns into the hands of ministers, who often proved unscrupulous, venal
and treacherous, and scrupled not to barter them to intriguers for the sako
of what they deemed to be their individual and personal self-aggrandisement.
It was a failing which stood out in jarrmg contrast to the noble traditions and
examples of a Babar, a Sher Shah, an Akbar, and an Aurangzeb, each of whom
‘scorned delights and lived laborious days.’ As bearing on the same point, I
may also quote from Bernier’s Tiavels pp. 129-130 the weighty words of
Aurangzeb, whilst admonishing one of his Omarah who had ventured to
express bis fears lest the Emperor’s incessant occupations might be productive
of injury to his health. Thus burst forth the Great Monarch in the follow-
ing noble strain :—‘ There can surely be but one opinion among yon learned
men as tothe obligations imposed upon a sovereign, in seasons of difficulty and
dnuger, to hazard his life, and, if necessary, to die sword in hand um defence of
the people commuticd to his charge. And yet this good and considerate man
would fain persuade me that the public weal ought to cause me no solicitade ;
thatin devising means to promote it, I should never pass a sleepless night, nor
spare a single dey from the pursuit of some low and sensual gratification.
According tabim, Iam to be swayed by considerations of my own bodily health,
and,chiefly to study whet may best minister to my personal ease and enjoy-
ment. No doubt, he would have me abandon the government of this vast
kingdom to some Vizier: he seems not to consider that, being born the son

in the period of Shuja‘u-d-danlah’s Nizdmat of Orissa, wasa Muhrar
attached to the latter’s household. At this time, he was invested
with the Deputy Diwini of the Sabah of Bengal, and being ap-
pointed Superintendent-General of the Affairs of the Nizimat and
the Diwani, he effected considerable retrenchments in the public ex-
penditure, and received the personal Mangab of a Hazari with the
title of Rai Raian—a title which until that time no officer of the
Bengal Nizimat or Diwani had enjoyed And Haji Ahmad! and
Mirz&é Bandi were sons of Mirzi Muhammad, who was a cup-bearer
of A‘zgam Shah, a son of Emperor Aurangzeb A‘lamgir. Haji Ah-
mad, on the death of his father, was appointed Cup-bearer and
Superintendent of the jewellery-stores of Sultfin Muhammad
A‘zzam Shah. As A‘zzam Shah? fell in the struggle for the Em-

of a king, and placed on a throne, I was sent into the world by Providence
to live and labour, not for myself, but for others; that it is my duty not to thank
of my own happiness, except so far as 1t is inseparably connected with the
happuness of my people, It is the repose and prosperity of my subjects that
it behoves me to consult; nor are these to be sacrificed to anything besides
the demands of justice, the maintenance of the royal authority, and the
security of the State. Tlhis man cannot penetrate into the consequence of
the inertness he recommends, and he is ignorant of the evels that attend upon
delegated power. It was not without reason that our great Saadi emphatic-
ally exclaimed :-—‘ Cease to be kings; Oh, cease to be kings; or determine
that your dominions shall be governed only by yourselves...’ Alas! we are
sufficiently disposed by nature to seek ease and indulgence ; we need no such
officious counsellors, Our wives too, are sure to assist usin treading the
flowery path of rest and Inxury.’’? What a noble ideal of kingly duty!, and
what a sad falling-off in later Moslem times !

LIn Senul-Butakhesvn and Stewart’s History of Bengal, it is stated that
Mirza Muhammad's eldest son was Haji Almad, and his second son was Mirza
Muhammad Ali (the latter received the title of Muhammad A‘li Vardi Khan,
through the favour of Shuja‘u-d-din Khin, whilst the Intter was Nazim of
Orissa). See Seir, Vol II, p. 470.

2 A‘jam Shih, surnamed Prince Muhammad A‘vam, was the second son of
Emperor Aurangzeb, his eldest brother being Prince Muhammad Muayam,
afterwards surnamed Emperor Bahadur Shih. On Emperor Aurangzeb's
death, there was a fratricidal struggle for the Empire between the aboye
two brothers, with the result thatat the sanguinary battle of Jajo, near Agra,
in 1119 A IL, A‘vam Shah, or Prince Muhammad A‘am, was killed, and Baha-
dar Shih became victorious, See description of this sanguinary battle with
the slaughter of several Princes Royal in the Seirul-Mutakher in, Vol. IT, p. 377.

pire, at the time of this Revolution, the two brothers leaving the
Imperial Capital proceeded to the Dakhin and thence to Odisa
(Orissa), and entered there the service of Shuja‘u-d-daulah, Ad-
optinga policy of tactand prudence which “isa friend, and like water,
takes to every hue,’ these two brothers got into the good graces of
Shuja‘u-d-daulah, When Shuja‘u-d-daulah acquired the Nizimat
of the Sibah of Bengal, Haji Ahmad became his intimate associate
and councillor in all affairs of the Nizémat; whilst Mirzi Bandi
was invested with the Mangab and tatle of A‘li Vardi Khan, and ap-
pointed Fanjdar of the Chaklah of Akbarnagar! (Rajmahal). Simi-
larly, the Haji’s eldest son, named Muhammad Ruza,? received the
office of Daroghah or Superintendent of the Bajwivak of Murgshida-
bid; his second son, Ag&é Muhammad Sa‘id, was appointed Deputy
Faujdar of Rangpiir; whilst his youngest son, Mirzi Muhammad
Hashim, was invested with the Mansab and title of Hashim A‘li
Khan. Pir Khan, who during Shuja‘u-d-daulah’s stay at Burhanpir
had rendered faithful services, and who from his youth to old age
had passed his days in his company, was at this time invested with
the Mangab and title of Shuja‘ Quli Khan. and given the Fanjdari
of the Port of Higli, on the transfer of Ahsanul-lah Khan.

ravages of Mahbratta freebooters or the incursions of Nadir Shah and Ahmad
Shah Durrani. .

1 * Mirza Bandi’ was another surname of Mirza Muhammad A’li (subse-
quently styled Muhammad A'‘li Vardi Khin). In Ses 1t is stated that he
formed the leading spirit in the Council or Cabinet of advisers of Nawab
Shuji‘u-d-din Khén, and that the Faujdarship of Akbarnagar or Rajmahal
waa bestowed by Shuja‘a-d-din Khan on A‘li Vardi Khin’s nephew and son-in-
law named Zain-udd-in Ahmad. See Ser, Vol, II, p. 472.

title of ‘Nawazigh Mohammad Khin,’ and was advanced to the offce of
Diwan of Bengal. I do not quite understand what the word ‘ Bajutrah’ in
the text means. It probably signifies “ Miscellaneous Revenne,”

House, he requisitioned troops from the Emperor, commenced
hostility with the English, Dutch, and French, and levied Nagass
and taxes. Itis said that once unloading from Enghsh vessels
bales of silk and cotton-stuffs, and placing these below the fort,
he confiscated them. The English troops advancing from Caleutta,
arrived near the fort. Shuja‘ Qui Khan finding himself an
unequal match for them climbed down, when the English troops
carried off their goods. The aforesaid Khan writing to Nawab
Shuja‘u-d-daulah requisitioned troops to attack the English,
and by cutting off supplies of Qasimbiizir and Caleutta, he ree
duced them to straits. The Chief of the English Factory at
Qasimbazar was compelled in consequence to arrange terms of
peace, by agreeing to pay three leks of rupees as nazar to Shuja‘u-
d-daulah. The Chief of the English Factory in Caleatta, borrow-
ing the nagarana money from the Calcutta bankers, remitted it
to Shuja‘u-d-daulah.

In short, as the good services of Shuja‘u-d-daulah came to the
notice of the Emperor through the medium of Khan Daurin
Khan, in recognition thereof, the Nizimat of the Stbah of Beharl
on the transfer of Fakhru-d-daulah, brother of Raushanu-d-
daulah Turibbiz Khan, was also conferred by the Emperor on
Nawab Shuja‘u-d-daulah. The aforesaid Nawab considering
Muhammad A‘li Vardi Khan to be a person of capacity and tact,
appointed him to be his Deputy Governor of Behar, and sent him
to ‘Azimabiid (Patna) with five thousand cavalry and infantry,
A‘li Vardi Khan, arriving in the Subah of Behar, associated
with himself, in the administration, General Abdul Karim

years. He was given to ease and pleasnres, and ul-treated not only his
minister, Shaikh Abdullah, who enjoyed the confidence of the public, but also
insulted Khwajab Mu’tassam (brother of Amirn-l-Umara Samgamno-d-daulah
Khiin Dauran Khwajah Asam). The latter 1m consequence left Patna, went
to Delhi, and complained to his brother, who held great influence at the
court of the Emperor, Mahammad Shih-Fakhra-d-danulah was at once re-
called, and Behar was added to the Bengal satrapy under Nawib Shuj‘an-

Deputy in the Nizamat of Behar, conferring on him (with the sanction of
the Emperor) the title of Mahabat Jang, and promoting him to the rank of
a Panjhazary. AM Vardi ruled over Beliar vigorously, See Seirul-MMuta-

Khin,! Chief of the Afghans of Darbhanga, and raised a levy of
efficient troops. Entrusting the reins of authority over administra-
tive and revenue affairs to the hands of Abdul Karim Khan, A‘li
Vardi Khan sent the former on an expedition against the Banjarah
tribe, who were a class of marauders and murderers, and who
in the guise of iraders and travellers used to plunder the
imperial domains and treasures Abdul Karim Khin, sub-
duing the Banjarah tribe, gained a large booty. Muhammad
A‘li Vardi, by chastising the Banja ah? tribe, achieved a high repu-
tation. And being aided by the Afghans; A‘li Vardi advanced with
his forces agninst the tracts of the Rajahs of Bitinh aud Bha-
warah,? who were refractory and turbulent. Their regions had
never previously been trod by the feet of the armies of former
Nazims, nor had their proud heads ever bended before to any of
the former Sibahdars. Indeed, they had never before paid the
imperial revennes and taxes. After fighting with them inces-
santly, A‘li Vardi Khan became victorious and triumphant. Raid-
ing and pillaging their tracts, A‘li Vardi Khan carried off a large
booty, amounting to several laks, in specie snd other effects. And
settling with the Rajahs the amounts of tribute, presents and the
imperial revenue, he raised animmense sum The soldiery also
were enriched by the booty, and the strength of Ali Vardi’s ad-
ministration increased. And drawing his forces against the
Qhakwar tribe, who had acquired a world-wide notoriety for their
marauding propensities, Ali Vardi also extirpated them Invad-
ing the tracts of the refractory and turbulent Zamindar of
Bhojpir,* and of Rajah Sundar Singh, Zamindar of Tikari, and of
Namdaér Khan Muin,' who, sheltered by dense forests and rocks,

had not cared for former Nazims, and had neglected to discharge
loyal duties, and without coercion had never paid the Imperial
revenue, Ali Vardi set about chastising every one of them, subdued
their tracts thoroughly, levied tho revenues from them to the
fullest extent, and reduced them to thorough subjeétion And
similarly punishing other insolent iebels, Ah Vaidi Khan placed
the ritg of submission on their ears And m a short penod
becoming master of immeuse treasures and a large army,
Ali Vardi’s power and prestige grew enormously. As ‘Abdul
Karim Khan held control over all the Stato affairs, he exercised
absolute sway, and ignored Muhammad Ali Vardi Khan. Hence
the latter becoming suspicious of the former, inveigled him by
some device into his own house, and slaying him raised the stand-
ard of triumph. And through the agency of Muhammad Ishéq
Khan,! Diwan of the Imperial Khalisah, Ali Vardi Khan opened
negociations with Qamru-d-din Khan,? the Imperial Vizier, and also
with other Imperial Ministers, and succeeded in obtaining directly
from the Emperor the title of Mahabat Jang*® Bahadur, without
Shuju‘d-d-daulah’s recommendation. Shuyja‘u-d-daulah, who re-
posed full confidence in Haji Ahmad and Ali Vardi Khan,
viewed without misgivings this elevation of Ali Vardi’s rank;
but his son, Sarfaréz Khan, felt misgivings about it. On account
of this difference in views, between the futher and the son a cool-
ness eet in. Another son of Shuja‘u-d-daulah by a different wife
was Muhammad Taqi Khau. He was Deputy Nazim of Orissa,
and was not only brave and bold but was also popular with the
Army. Haji Ahmad and Ali Vardi Khan basing their intrigue
ou bis rivalry contrived to bring about a rupture, advantageous to
themselves, between the two brothers. When the plan of this
intrigue was matured, Haji Abmad secured the adhesion of
Rai Raidn ‘Alam Oband and Jagatset Fateh hand; and the

Triumvirate now waited for the development of their conspiracy.
Shuja‘u-d-daulah, by the advice of the Triumvirate, was induced
not to entrust the control of any affair to Sarfaraz Khan. When
the fibres of mistrust thus sown took root in the soil of the hearts
of the son and the father, as well as of the two brothers, and these
were about to germinate, Muhammad Taqi Khan, ascertaining the
real origin of this misunderstanding, proceeded from Orissa to
Bengal, to personally interview lis father and brother. The
Councillors of Shujé‘u-d-daulah, finding the odds of the times
evenly balanced, fanned strfes and fomented jealousies between
the two brothers, so much so that both the latter prepared to fight.
Muhammad Tagi Khan with lus army rode ont, and arrayed his
force on a sandy plain, opposite to the Murshidabad Fort, on the
other side of the river Bhagiati Thence he advanced to inter-
view his father, but did not plunder the City. And the army
of Sarfa:az Khan was arranged in battle-array from Naktakhali
to Shihnagar, and was ready to kindle the fire of war and slaugh-
ter Secretly tempting by offers of bribe the commanders and
officers of Muhammad 'l'agi’s army, Sarfaraz Khan won them over
to his side, and sending messages for Muhammad Taqi’s capture,
waited for the enemy, in the hope that when the two contending
hosts would face each other in battle-array, his own officers would
eapture Muhammad Taqi and bring Lim in. Muhammad Taqi
Khan, who in bravery was the Rustam! of his day, did not cave for
the enemy. The negociations for peace and war passed and re-
passed between the two brothers. When Nawab Shuja‘u-d-
daulah saw that affairs lad taken a grave turn, he intervened, re-
conciled the brothers, and prevented their fighting. And out of
regard for the feelings of Sarfariz Khau and the Begams, rebuk-
ing several times Muhammad Tagi Khan, Shuja‘u-d-daulah pro-
hibited the latter from coming to see and salute him. At length,
at the intercession of Sarfariz Khan’s mother, he pardoned
Muhammad Tagi Khan, and permitted him to go back to the
Stbah of Orissa, But on arrival in Orissa, in the year 1147
AH., owing to the witchcraft of the enemy, he’died. On this,

of Shuja‘u-d-daulah and was already Deputy Nazim of Jahingir-
nagar (Dacca), and was a son of a merchant of the Port of Sarat,
and who in his writings and compositions, and in his poetical
productions and caligraphy, enjoyed great excellence, was appoint-
ed Deputy Nazim of the Subah of Orissa.

During the Viceroyalty of Nawab Ja‘far Khan, whilst the
abovementioned Murshid Quli Khan! stayed at Murshidabad,
@ person named Mir Habib, a native of Shiraz, spoke Persian very
fluently, though he was not read in that language. By chance,
Mir Habib arrived in the Port of Htgli, where he earned his live-
lihood by retailing the wares of Mughal merchants. Owing to his
kindred mercantile pursuits, and also owing to his conversational
powers, Mir Habib quickly ingratiated himself with Murshid
Quli Khan, and entered the latter’s service, When Nawab Ja‘far
Khan conferred the Governorship of Jahangir-nagar (Dacca) on
Murghid Quli Khan, Mir Habib also went in the latter’s company
to Jahangir-nagar (Dacca), and was attached to the latter as his
Deputy. By personally attending to minute details, aud by adopt-
ing a policy of economy, Mir Habib curtailed the State expendi-
ture on account of the Nawarah (war-vessels), the artillery, and

been erected by Nawab Shuja‘u-d-din Khan, when the latter was Nazim of
Onssa. The tomb of Mubammad Taqi Khan 1s now in a dilapidated condition.
On it I found still the following inscmption: &» (p> ely) wh, p 4)

makes mention of this Katak Qadam Rasul building, and of the Deputy
Governo:, Abdul Nabi Khin (father of Abdur Rasul Khin, another Deputy
Governor of Orissa), being entombed there. In this connection, I may point
out there is a historial anachronism in the Qadam Rasul building inscription
which states “it was erected by Shanji‘u-d-din Khin in the time of Alamgir
II.” Ghuji‘u-d-din was not a contemporary of Alamgir II at all, he was a
contemporary of Alamgir I whilst at Katak, and of Emperor Muhammad
Shah, whilst Nazim of Bengal.

1 The reader must not confound this Murshnd Quili Khin (son-in-law
of Shuja‘n-d-daulah whose real name was Mirza Lutfullah) with Nawab Ja‘far
Khan, who had formerly held the title of ‘Murshid Qui Khan.’ On re-
ference to the account of Ja‘far Khin in the text, it would appear that ‘ Ja‘far
Khiin received several titles in succession; first he received the title of
‘Kartalab Khin,’ next that of ‘Murshd Quli Khan,’ and lastly that of
‘Mutaman-ul-Mulk Alau-d-daulah Jafir Khin Nasr Jang,” lus orgmal

the army, and thus rendered good services, aud in consequence,
shortly after, bis official rank was raised. Finding tLe tract of
Jahangir-nagar (Dacca) to be fertile, profit-yielding, and suited for
trading business, he revived the system of Sauda-i-khas current
during the Viceroyalty of Prince Azimu-gh-Shan, and by means
of other exactions, both he and his Chief amassed wealth. On tho
pretext of collecting the Imperial revenue, he induced N twu-l-lah,
Zamindar of Parganah Jalalpir,? who was the leading Gamindar,
together with other Zamindars, to attend his Kachiri (Court).
Adroitly dismissing the other Zamindars, one after another, Mir
Habib kept Niaru-l-lah under duress. At midinght, he permitted
him to return home, escorted by a numbor of Afghans. The latter,
at the instigation of Mir Habib, slew Niiru-l-lal, in a narrow
and dark alley. Next morning, Mir Habib announced that Niru-
l-lah had fled, sent a detachment to his house, confiscated lus
treasures and jewelleries and effects and silk-stuffs, amounting in
value to several Jaks, as well as his Abyssinian male and female
slaves. Mir Habib possessed himself of the above, and thus
acquired aristocratic paraphernalia.

Subsequently leaguing with Ag& Sadiq, Zamindar of Patpasar,!
who in artfulness and cunning was his match, Mir Habib sent him
on an expedition against Tiprah. By chance the Aq& met the
nephew of the Rajah of Tiprah, who having escaped from the con-

called Jallapur (revenue, 1,857,280 dams) under Sarkar Fathabad, avother
being Dahlat Jallapur (1cvenue, 1,200 dams) under Sarkar Mahmiidabid. The
first Jallapar or Sarail is situated m the Brahmanbaria Sub-Division of the
present Tiprah district, and when I was in charge of that sub-division in
1896, I fonnd the head of the Musaiman family there (who was still called a
Diwan) in an impoverished condition. The second Jallalpur pargauah is now
in the modern Fandpur district, and is owned, I beheve, by the present
Musalman Zamindars of Habibganj in that district It may be that
‘Habibganj’ owes its name to Mir Habib; specially as there wae formerly a
*“ Ohaklah Habibganj.””

where tt is, nor know if any descendants of tlus family survive 1 may, how-
ever, add here that local traditions prevalent in Tiprah mention that the
Diwans of Horishpur (another old family of Musalman Zamindars, now in an
mmpoverished condition) had something to do with tho old Tiprah Rajahs,
and with their conquest by the Mughals. I am not sure uf Aga or Aga

trol of his uncle was wandering away from his native country,
and who at this time happened to stay within the Imperial domi-
nions. The aforesaid Ag& considering his company very lucky
kept him in his company, promising to instal him in the Zamin-
dari. The Rajah’s nephew, according to the saying,—

“The hare of that country can assuredly catch the dog of
that tract,”—

guided the Aga through the rocky defiles and river-fords, and led
him to the country of Tiprah. The Rajah of Tiprah, who was
careless and was unaware of the incursion of the Imperial army,
was paralysed by this sudden on-rush of the Imperialists, and not
having the capacity to fight fled to the summit of the hills. The
tract of Tiprah, without any difficulty, fell into the hands of Mir
Habib, who by fightings stormed the fort of Qhandigadah, which
was the residence! of the Rajah. Capturing numerous booty,
Mir Habib brought the tract of Tiprah within the Imperial
domains After completing the settlement of this tract, Mir
Habib ® appointed Ag& Sadiq as Fanjdar of Tiprah, and the

not know where Ghandigadah lies. It could not have been far away from
Agartala. ‘Tiprah or Commilla does not appear in Akbar’s rent-roll of
Bengal.

2 A full acconnt of Mir Habib is given in the Setru-l-Mutakherin, Vol. II, Pers.
text, pp. 598, 591, 590, d&c. (also see Maasiru-l-Umara, Vol. II, p. 844). He
subsequently joined the Mahrattas, and induced the !atier to invade Orissa
and Bengal in order to have his revenge against Ali Vardi Khan for supplanting
from the Governorship of Orissa his old master and benefactor, Murghid Quli
Khin (son-in-law of Shuja‘a-d-din Khin). He appears to have been a man
of wonderfal resourcefulness, bravery and tact, and gave no end of trouble to
Ali Vardi, who at length had to patch up a peace with Mir Habib and the
Mahrattas, by appointing Mir Hpbib as his Deputy Nazim in Orisea, the
arrangement being that Mir Habib was to pay the Mahratta army of ocenpa-
tion from the revenue of Orissa, besides receiving from Ali Vardi an annual
subsidy of twelve Zaks, Mir Habib’s signal services to the Mahrattas im the
end were most churlishly requited by the latter, for Janoji, son of the Mahratta
Raghoji Bhonsla, treacherously murdered him at Katak (see Sewu--Mutakherm,
Vol. II, p. 592, Pers text), after having invited him toa feast But thronghout
them rise, treachery was their great weapon of offence and defence, and the
Mahratta freebooters could not lay 1t down, even in the treatment of one,
who, though distinct from them m race and religion, had given them the

Rajah’s nephew as the Rajah,? whilst he himself returned to
Jahangirnagar (Dacca) with treasures, valunbles and elephants.
Morshid Quali Khan sent to Nawab Shuja‘a-d-daulah an account
of the conquest of Tiprah, together with the best specimens of the
wares and silk-stuffs of that tract. The Nawab named that tract
(of Tiprah) Raughan&bad,* and invested Murshid Quli Khan with
the title of ‘Bahadur,’ and conferred on Mir Habib the title of
‘ Khan?

In short, when the Deputy-Nizamat of the Sibah of Odisah
(Orissa) was bestowed on Murshid Quli Khan, the latter, on the
recommendation of Nawab Shuja‘u-d-daulah, was given by the
Emperor the title of Rustam-Jang. Observing the old ago of his
father, and fearing lest after the latter’s death Rustam-Jang
might fight against him, Sarfariz Khin® detained at Murshi-
dabid as hostages Rustam-Jang’s son, named Yahy& Khan, and
his wife, named Durdanah Begam. Although this incident caused
some bitterness of feeling to Murshid Quli Khan, the latter had
no alternative but to endure it in silence. Murshid Quli Khan
with his army arrived in the Sibah of Orissa, and appointed Mir
Ilabibu-l-Inh Khan to be his Deputy there, in the same way as
the latter had been his Deputy at Jahangirnagar. By use of di-
plomacy, aud by dint of statesmanship and energy, Mir Habib
sneceeded in chastising and reducing to order all refractory
Zamindars of Orissa. He neglected no step towards the per-
fect organisation and settlement of Orissa, and effected a surplus
in its revenue, During the commotion in Muhammad Taqi Khin’s
time, the Rajah of Parsutam* had removed Jagannath, the Hindu

1 Rvidently, the Rajah was no longer an independent Rajah, but was left
more or less as a feudntory prince.

still beaing the word “ Qhaklah Ranshanabad.” I do not know if they have
been since changed.

d.din Khin, having married Durdana Begam, step-sister of Sarfariz Khin.

God, from the limits of the Sibah of Odisah (Oriasa), and had
guarded it on the summit of a hill across the Ohilka lake. In con-
sequence of the removal of the idol, there was a falling-off to the
tune of nine leks of rupees in the Imperial revenue, aceruing from
pilgrims. Establishing friendly relations with Mir Habibu-l-lah
Khan, and paying nazar to the Nazim of the time, Rajah Dand
Deo brought back Jagannath the Hindu God to Parsiitam (Puri),
and. re-established the worship of Jagannath at Puri An account
of the worship of Jagannath has been already given m the text of
this History.

When the Deputy-Nizamat of Odisah (Orissa) was conferred on
Murshid Quli Khan Rustam-Jang, the Deputy-Nizamat of the
Chaklah of Jahangirnagar (Dacca) was bestowed on Sarfaraz Khan.!
The latter appomted as his Deputy-Governor Ghalib Ali Khan
who was a scion of the Royal family of Persia, and deputed
Ghalib Ali Khan to Dacca, Sarfaraz Khan also appointed Jasunat
Rai, the late Nawab Jafar Khan’s® Secretary, and his own tutor-

2 It may be noted here there was a radical change in the administrative
machinery of Bengal, during the la. r part of Emperor Aurangzeb’s reign,
The offices of Nazim and Diwan had been hitherto kept quite distinct, buts re-
trograde step towards their eventual amalgamation was taken by Aurangzeb,
when the latter appointed his favourite officer Murshid Quli Khan I. (after.
wards Nawab Ja‘far Khin) to the dual offices of Diwan of Bengal and Orissa
and Deputy Nazim of Bengal and Orissa. Murshid Quli Khan I. could not
personally perform the functions of these dual offices, and whilst himself
personally holding the portfolio of Deputy Nizamat of Bengal (the Chief
Nazim being still Prince Azimu-sh-Shan), he delegated the office of Diwan in
Bengal to Syed Akram Khan and, on the latter’s death, to Syed Razi Khin,
(son-in-law of Shujau-d-din Khin,) and that of Deputy Nazim and Diwan of
Orissa to Shaja‘u-d-din Khan (Ins son-in-law) Emperor Farrukh Sir, on his
accession to the throne of Delhi, further confirmed and accentuated the above
adminstiative change by uniting in the person of Nawab Ja‘far Khan the offices
of Nazim of Bengal and Orissa, and of Diwan of those Provinces. This union
of the two offices, whilst weakening the Imperial hold thereon, greatly added
to the prestige of the Bengal Satrap, and gave him almost a semi-regal aspect.
This regal aspect was futher broadened by Emperor Muhammad Shah adding
Behar to the Bengal Satrapy, whilst Nawab Shuji‘n-d-din waa the Bengal
Viceroy. Fo. purposes of admmistration, Shuja‘a-d-din appomted a State
Couneil uf tives members to help him im the administration, and divided his
entire Sairapy, consisiing of threo Provinces of Bengal, Behar, ond Orissa, intin
four Political or Adrainistrative Divisions, vw : (1) Bengal Proper, comprising
Western, Central, and a portion of Noithern Bengal, (2) Jahangir-nagar or

guardian, to be the Diwin and Minister of that place, and sent
him to Dacca, in company of Ghahb Ali Khan. And ont of :egard
for Nafisah Bégam, his siste:, he bestowed the office of Superm-
tendent of the Nawaiah (wai-vessels) on Murad A‘li Khin,! son of
Syed Razi Khan. The control over Fiscal and Home affairs, and
the manegement of Crown-lands, Jagirs, wavr-vessels, artillery,
Accounts and Customs-house were all entrusted to Munghi Jasiinat
Rai. In that the aforesaid Munshi had been trained up by Nawab
Ja‘far Khan, by dint of honesty and mtegrity, by thorough
attention to details and by ripe wisdom, he effected not only an
increase in the State Revenue, but secured the happiness of the
people. He completely abohshed the system of Saudd-o-khas, and
banished the exactions and innovations imtraduced by Mir Habib,
during the segime of Murshid Quli Khan.? Pnitting forth landable
efforts to keep down the selling-rates of food-grains, and effect-
ing cheapness in their prices, he threw open the westein gate
of the Fort of Jahangirnagar (or Dacca), which Nawab Amiru-l-
Umara Shaistah Khan lad closed, inscribmg on it a prohibition to
the effect that no one should opon it, until he succeeded in reducing

Dacca Division comprising Eastern and Southern Bengal, and a small portion
of Northern Bengal, and including Sylhet and Chittagong, (3) Behar Division,
(4) Orissa, Division. Shuja‘u-d-din Khan directly admimstered the firat Divi.
sion, and appointed a Deputy Nazim or Deputy-Governor to hold charge of
each of the other three Admuuistrative Divisions, under his general control
and supervision.

t Murad A‘lt Khan was a son of Nafisah Begam, uterine sister of Sarfa-
riz Khin. Nafisah Bégam was a daughter of Shuji‘u-d-din Khiin, and was
married to Syed Razi Khin, who was Diwin of Bengal, on the death of
Byed Akram Khién, during the seyeme of Nawab Ja‘far Khin. On Syed
Razi Khan’s death, during the reign of Hmperor Farrukh Sir, on the nomina-
tion of Nawab Ja‘far Khan (his maternal grandfather), Mirzi Asadn-l-lah
received the title of Sarfariz Khin and was appointed Diwin of Bengal,
Sarfariz Khin continued to be the nominal Diwan of Bengal, whilst his
father Shuja‘n-d-din Khan succeeded Nawib Ja‘far Khin as Nizm of Bengal,
being deprived, however, of all real power, which was transferred to the State
Gonuncil, consisting of Haj. Ahmad (brother of Ali Vardi Khan), Diwan
Alamohand, and Fatihchand Jagat Set.

the price of food-grains to one seer of the Bazar weight per Dirham,
as was current in the Nawab’s time. From that time until now,
no one else had been able to effect such cheapness in the rate of food-
grains. He rendered the tract of Jahangirnagar (Dacca) fertile,
hike the garden of Inam®, by sprinkhng on it the waters of hberality,
equity and justice; and in consequence, Sarfaraéz Khan won a good
name amongst all classes of his subjects Atthe desire of Nafisah
Bégam, Murad Ali Khan was married to a daughter of Sarfaraz
Khan, and was appointed Deputy-Governor of Jahangirnagar
(Dacca) in the place of Ghalib A‘li Khan. Murad Ali Khan now
promoted Raj Balab, a clerk attached to the Admiralty, to the office
of Péshkir thereof, and commenced oppressions.* Munshi Jasfinat
Rai, who had acquired a good name amongst the people, appre-
hending that lis reputation might be taimshed, resigned his office
of Diwan, and the Province of Jahangirnagar or Dacca turned to
desolation through the tyranny of the new oppressive Deputy
Nazim.

that there isa place called Muradnagar, nem Daudkandi, 21 Commillah, which
is associated with some former Nuwabs of Dacca, aud where some landed pro-
perty is still, I believe, owned by the Bhiknapshai Nawabs of Patna, said to

Muradnagar owes 1t3 name and o1igin to this Murid A‘li Khan.

those whom he oppressed, he mobilised an army. Requisitioning
troops from the Emperor, he marched with his troops against the
Rajahs of Kuch Behar and Dinajpir. Those Rajas fancying they
were masters of large armies, and also fancying that they were
sheltered by numerous forests and rivers, had hitherto paid little
heed to the authority of the Nazim. By dint of diplomacy and
by use of force, and by wars and battles, Mirza Muhammad Sa‘id
conquered those tracts, and acquired possession of the treasures,
buried hoards, jewelleries and effects of those Rajahs. Owing to
the immense treasure—aindeed the treasure of a Croegus—that thus
fell into his hands, he acquired much power. After the conquest
of Knoh Bihar, by hamouring Haji Ahmad, on the recommenda-
tion of Nawab Shuja‘u-d-daulah and Sarfariz Khan, Mirzé
Muhammad Sa‘id received the titles of ‘Khin’ and ‘ Bahadur.’

Nawab Shuja’u-d-daulah, on the advice of his Triumvirate
Council, deputed Sarfaraz Khan to chastise Badi‘u-z-zaman,
zamindar of Birbhim Sheltered by rocks and forests and support-
ed by numerous Afghans, this zamindar did not bend his head
in submission to the Nazim, and failed to pay the revenue beyond
the stipulated tribute. He had also diverted to dancing-parties
and pleasures fourteen laks of revenue derived from the measured
and cultivated lands, that had been endowed for the express pur-
pose of helpmg the poor and the scholarly. The zamindér him-
self was plunged in dissipations and frivolities. On the ridges of
Khubra Kandi and Lakra Khondah and of other hills and narrow
rocky defiles, he had mounted strong puards, and cut off all ingress
and egress of the Impenal troops and scouts, and he fancied the
forest flanked by the hills to bea secure recess, in that no one could
enter that tract without his passport. He had appointed his
brother, Azam Khan, to administer bis State, and his son, A‘Hi Quli
Khan, to command his army, and Naubat Khan to be his Diwan
and Minister. Badi‘u-z-zamin himself did no work, but wasted
his time on flute-playing and on carousals. Sarfaraiz Khan sent
him a message, containing promises and rewards in the event of
his submission to Nawab Shuja‘u-d-daulah, and embodying also
threats and punishments m the event of his recalcitrance and
disloyalty, Subsequently, Sarfariz Khan despatched wa Bardwan
hus special confidantes, Khwajah Basant and Mir Sharfu-d-din, the
second Paymaster-General, with a large army, Badi‘u-z-zaman
now prudently woke up from the slumber of vanity, and ten-

dered his homage and submission. Inducing the aforesaid Mir and
the above Khwajah to become his interceders, he sent through the
latter a petition expressive of submission and loyalty, and subse-
quently in the company of the former he set out for Murshidabad.
And after waiting on Sarfariz Khau, through the troduction of
Mir Sharfu-d-din, Badi‘n-z-zamin was granted an audience by
Nawab Shuja‘u-d-daulah, who not only pardoned his past misde-
meanour, but generously bestowed on him khila‘ts. Badi‘u-z-
zaman agreed to pay three laks of rupees annually on account of
the Imperial revenue, consented to abide by the ordinary proce-
dures for payment of land-revenue and for execution of orders, and
furnished as his surety Karatohand,! zamindér of Bardwin. He
was then allowed to return to Birbhum.

Towards the close of the year 1151 AH, when Nadir Shah
invaded * the Imperial Capital, and Samsaimu-d-daulah Khan-dauran
fell im the battle’ against Nadir Shah, Nawab Shujai‘nu-d-daulah
being ill and confined to bed permitted Yahya Khan and Dur-
danah Begam (son and wife respectively of Murshid Quli Khan)
to go to Orissa, and proclaimed Sarfaréz Khan as his heir. Har-
nestly exhorting the latter to confide in Haji Ahmad, the Rai
Raian‘4 and Jagatset, and always to respect their feelings, and
entrusting to him control over the offices of the Nizimat, Nawab
Shuja‘u-d-din Khan died on the 13th Zilhaj of the aforesaid year.
After laying to rest Shuja‘n-d-daulah’s 5 corpse in the sepulchre
which he (Shuja‘u-d-daulah) had in his lifetime erected at Deh-
para, opposite to the Fort and the City of Murghidabad, Sarfaraz

1 Badi‘u.z-zamin Kkin of Birbhum, and Karatchand of Bardwan, appear to
have been the two principal zamindéis in Western Bengal atthe time, I un-
derstand the descendants of Badi‘n-z-zamin still survive at Birbhum, but are
in an impoverished condition.

A full description of Nadu Shah’s invasion will be found in all Indian
histories, and also m Sesu-l-Mutukher +m, Vol, II, p. 482.

NIZAMAT OF NAWAB SARFARAZ KHAN.

When Nawab Sarfaraz Khan mounted the masnad of the Niza-
mat of Bengal, agreeably to the dying instructions of bis father,
he appointed Haji Ahmad, the Ra: Rain and Jagatset to be his
Councillors m respect of Revenue and Administrative affairs.
But these meddling more than before in State affairs ignored the
old officers of Sarfaraz Khan who expected promotions and man-
gabs, and further intrigued to bring about their disgrace and over-
throw Although Nawab Sarfaraz Khan and the Begams were
anxious to promote their old officers, owing to the opposition of the
Triumvirate Council, they could not do so. The Trumvirate
Council, after secret vows and stipulations, plotted to callin Ali
Vardi Khan with his army from ‘Azimabad (Patna) under pre-
text of visiting the Nazim, and then to instal him on the smasnad
of the Nizimat in supercession of Sarfaraz Khan | And m
deliberations over this plot they passed days and nights, but failed
to mature any plan. At this time, Nadir Shah, * the king of Per-
sia, had defeated Muhammad Shah, captured Nizimu-]-Mulk,
Borhénu-]-Mulk, Qamru-d-din Khin, and Muhammad Khan Bang-
agh, &c., who were the pillars of the Mughal Empire,’ and en-

1 The anthor of the Maaseru-l-Umara states that Sarfaiiz Khan rendered
himself unpopular by adopting a policy of gid economy and retrenchment,
and by reducing ns army, and that this gave an opportunity to Ali Vardi
Khin to intrigue, in concert with the latter's brother, Haji Ahmad, who was
Sarfariz Khin’s chief councillor Seep. 844, Maaseru-l-Umaia, Vol. II, p. 844,
It should, however, be added in justice to Sarfariz Khin’s memory that
this policy was inspired by the faithless Triumvirate Councillors, whom
Sarfariz Khan trasted owing to the dying exhortations of his father, and
that it formed a part of the despicable trap they were cunningly laying to
ruin and overthrow their benefactor’s son. One feels sick to dwell on such
tales of vile treachery, for Sarfariz Khin from all accounts appears to have
been an ideally noble and mild prince.

tering Shah-jahanabad (Delhi) 1 with his Persian troops had plan-
dered the palaces of both the Emperor and his nobles In conse-
quence, the whole Empue was shaken to its foundation.? The
Triumvirate Council persuaded Sarfaraz Khan to mtroduce in
Bengal the coms and the Khufhuh® of Nidir Shih, and about
the same time they remitted the confiscated treasures of Shu-
ja‘u-d-daulah and the Bengal tribute in charge of Murid Khan,
who had arrrved in Murghidabad on behalf of Qamru-d-din
Khan* long before Nadir Shih’s invasion Haji Ahmad and
Ali Vardi Khan intrigued with Murid Khan, and won him
over to their side On the withdrawal of Nadir Shah, they
carried tales of the introduction of the Nadir Shahi coin and
Khutbah to Nawab Qamru-d-din Khan and to Niziému-l-Mulk, and
laid various other charges against Sarfaraz Khan. Aided by the
machinations of the Imperial mimsters,® they secured a royal
patent granting to them tle Nizimat of Bengal, and authorising
the execution of Sarfariz Khan,® on account of his treason in
introducing the com and Khutbah of Nadir Shih. When the

subsequently denouncing the latter before the Emperor Muhammad Shih. It

arrow of their efforts reached the butt of their sim, the Triumvir-
ate Council represented to Sarfariz Khan that the resources of
the State were limited, whilst its expenditure was heavy, and
thereby persuaded the Nawib to reduce the strength of his Army.
They at the same time secretly sent instructions to Ali Vardi
Khan to mobilise troops and collect arms, n view of the mvasionu
of Bengal Whoever was cashiered from the army of Sarfaraz
Khan was straightway enlisted by Haji Ahmad in the service of
Ali Vardi Khan, and sent off to Azimabad (Patna) Nearly one-
half of Sarfaraz Khan’s troops were in this way disbanded. Ali
Vardi Khan, having completed preparations for war and mobilised a
large army consisting of Afghans, Rohilabs, and Bhalias, set out for
Bengal; whilst Hai Ahmad sent his and his sons’ hoarded treasures
amounting to several laks of rupees for the expenses of Ali Vardi's
army. When Sarfardz Khan, from the despatches of his Political
Agents at the Court of the Emperor, and from informations of emis-
saries, came to be apprised of the machinations of the treacherous
enemy, deemingit prudent to adopt remedy for the affair before it
came to pass, he set himself to overthrow the traitors, and dgcided
to bestow the Deputy-Governorship } of Azimabad (Patna) on his
son-in-law, Syed Muhammad Hasan, in supercession of Ali Vardi
Khan, and the Fanjdari of Akbarnagar (Rajmahal) together with
the command of Sakrigali and Téhagadhi passes on Mir Sharfu-d-
din Bakhshi, n supercession of A‘tau-l-lah Khan, son-in-law of
Haji Akbmad, Sarfariz Khan also determined to appoint Munshi
Jaganat Rai as Diwan in the place of the Rai Raiin. But
as yet this decision had not been put in force, when the mem-
bers of the Triumvirate Council adroitly submitting a representa-
tion about their long services, the heavy outstandings of the Im-
perial Revenue, and their losses, persuaded Sarfaraz Khan to post-
pone their supercession and the installation of othersin their places
till their preparation of the Annual Balance-sheet, which fell due
after three months.? Sarfaraz Khan, who owing to guileesness of

states that Sarfariz Khan transferred the office of Diwan from Haji Ahmad
to Mir Murtaza, and contemplated transferri g the Fanjdari of Raymahal from
Atao-l-lah Khan to his son-in-law, Hasan Muhammad Khin.

able lack of judgment in accepting this false representation of his faithless

his nature had already been victimised by the duplicity of the
Triumvirate Council, once agnin suffered himself to be duped
by their wiles. A‘li Vardi Khan, utilising this short respite,
secured the adhesion of Mustafa Khan, Shamshér Khan, Sardar
Khan, U‘mar Khan, Rahim Khan, Karam Khan, Sirandiz Khan,
Shaikh Ma‘sim, Shaikh Jahangir Khan, Muhammad Zilfuqar
Khan, Ghidan Hazi»t? (Bakhshi of the Bhaliahs), Bakhtiwar
Singh, and other Generals and officers of the Army. Under
the false pretext of waiting on Sarfariz Khan, A‘li Vardi Khan
marched swiftly, crossed the passes of Tiliagadhi and Sakvigali,
and reached the frontiers of Bengal. At the instigation of Haji
Ahmad, Ataullah Khan, Faujdar of Akbarnagar (Rajmahal), had
taken steps to prevent all movements of messengers and spies, and to
interdict all intercourse through news-letters between A'zimaibéd
(Patna) and Bengal wid the passes of Tiliagadhi and Sakvigali,
until A‘li Vardi Khan had crossed through those passes. In
consequence, no news of A‘li Vard: Khan's movements had reached
Sarfaraz Khan. 16 was only when tho vangnard of A‘li Vardi
Khan’s army had actually reached Akbarnagar (Rajmahal), that all
of a sudden the news of Ali Vardi Khan's movement reached Sar-
faraz Khan This news threw both the City of Murgshidabad and
its Bazaar into commotion. Perplexed by this news, Sarfaraz Khan
instantly imprisoned Haji Ahmad. Although the Rai Raian
treacherously explained that A‘li Vardi’s arrival was for the pur-
pose 6f waiting on Sarfariz Khan, this explanation had no reassur-
ing effect. Detailing Ghaug Khan and Mir Sharfu-d-din, who

dars of Bengal, marched out from the City with a large army and
fire-pouring artillery, and encamped at Balhmaniah, which is two
Kaoh distant from Murghidabad. Marching on the second day,
the Nawab reached Sarai Diwan, and marching on the third day,
he encamped at Khamrah, where he mustered his army and re-
viewed its strength and aimaments. In that the officers of
Shuj‘a Khan’s regime were 1n league with Haji Ahmad, brick-bats
instead of shells were discovered in the arsenal, and rubbish was
found inside guns. Consequently, cashiering Shahriar Khan, the
Haji’s brother, who was General Superintendent of the Artillery,
and making him over to the custody of his retainers, Nawab
Sarfariz Khin appointed in his place Pancho, son of Antony the
Portuguese, to be General Superintendent of the Artillery. The
forces of Mahabat Jang were arranged in the form of a circle from
Aurangabad, at the mouth of the Siti (where the shrine of Shah
Murtaza’ Hindi exists) to the plain of Balkatah.

On the fourth day, when the silvery-crowned King (7.¢., the
Sun) pranced on to the plain of the sky from his camp in the
Rast darting forth daggers of radial lines, and the dusky Moon
with thousands of its forces (7.e, sta:s), not finding itself a match
for that unique Cavalier, hid itself behind the hills, Nawab Sar-
fardz Khan, selecting an auspicious moment according to astro-
logers, advanced to assault the esiemy. By one single assault, the
troops of Mahabat Jang were thrown into panic and confusion,
were set a-reeling, and were nearly routed. The Rai Raidn,! find-
ing that the table was being turned, at this: moment treacherously
represented to Nawib Sarfaraéz Khan that the Sun had moved
right vertical to the head, and that at that sultry hour if fighting
were continued, both horses and soldiers would perish, owing to
excessive heat and thirst, and that therefore if that day further
fightings were postponed, next morning the bitter-palated enemy
could be treated to a similar bitter soup (of death)—

Whence'will thy enemy command the strength,

To fight with thee P

Owing to thy guod luck,

The enemy's head shall be trampled upon by thy feet.

Khiin’s father, under the false mask of loyalty, did more damage te Sarfariz
Khan’s cause, than oven A‘li Vardi Kain and his brother Haji Ahmad, But it

313

Although astrologers descanted on the auspiciousness of that
hour for fighting, and adduced arguments in proof of the incom-
ing victory, and although his Generals insisted on continuing
the battle, Sarfaréz Khan was unmoved, and forbade by use of
threats further fightings that day. Then Sarfaraz Khan encamp-
ed on the banks of the Geriah river. Meanwhile, a letter from
Mahabat Jang came avowing his loyalty, and explaining that he
had come simply to pay his respects to Sarfaraz Khan. Sarfariz
Khan, who was quite inexperienced, on perusal of the letter, be-
came reassured, dispensed with all precautions, foolishly released
Haji Ahmad, who was the root of all the disturbance, and sent
him to A‘li Vardi Khan Mahabat Jang, in order to reassure the
latter and to biing him over. He also sent in the Haji’s company
Shojé Quli Khan and Khwijah Basant, his two special conjidantes,
with a view to ascertain exactly the prospects of peace and war, to
guage correctly the dispositions of A‘li Vardi’s Army, and then to
apprise him accurately. The imprisonment of the Haji with his
other relatives had plunged Mahabat Jang into a whirlpool of
confusion. He had apprehended that they would be slain, and
had, therefore, hesitated to offer battle. Viewing the release of
the Haji to be auspicious, nay as the first augury of victory,
Mahabat Jang (A‘li Vardi) enclosed in a casket a brick, giving out
16 contained the Holy Qoran, held it in his hand, and swore by it
that next morning he would with folded hands present himself be-
fore Nawab Sarfaraz Khan, and would sue for pardon for his mis-
conduct. At the same time he presented two hundred gold coins to
Khwajah Basant. These iwWiots (Shuj‘a Quli Khan and Khwajah
Basant), not fathoming the water under the grass, returned happy
and jolly, and describing to Nawab Sarfaréz Khan the loyal dis-
position of A‘li Vardi Khan cooled the fire of his wrath. Nawab
Sarfaraz Khan then ordered his butler to prepare dainty dishes for
a banquet, sat re-assured on the bed of comfort, nay slumbered the
sleep of insecurity on the bed of sleep (which is akin to death);
and his soldiers, intoxicated by the inebriation of the wine-cup of
peace, let go from their hands the reins of watch and alertness.

Aye! It is sheer folly to rely on the cajolery of thy enemy:
The seeming prostration of floods undermines walls !

less out of a faithless herd.


--- Page 341 ---
314

After the withdrawal of Sarfaraz Khan’s emissaries, A‘li Vardi
Khan soothed and won over his officers by promising them two
months’ pay in the event of his victory, and also by promising
them the booty that might be captured. He thus incited and in-
atigated them to fight, and distributed shells, gunpowder and arma-
ments. ‘I'he Geuerals of Sarfaraéz Khan’s army who from before
were in league with A‘li Vardi Khan, were all ready for treachery
and regicide. The only exceptions were Muhammad Ghaug Khan
and Mir Sharfu-d-din, Commanders of the vanguard of Sarfaraz
Khan’s army, who were posted at the ford of the mver Geriah.
Ascertaining through messengers and spies the secret plot of
teachery that was hatching, both the above Generals at midnight
hastened to Sarfariz Khin, apprised the latter of the fire of
treachery that was fanning under a straw-covering, and offered by
way of precaution to remove him that night to their own camp,
and there to guard him, and next morning to sacrifice their lives
by fighting gallantly round him. In that in matters of destiny,
efforts are helpless, and the knot of Fate cannot be untied with the
nail of Efforts, the will of Providence cast the quicksilver of
heedlessness into the ear of Sarfaraz Khin Placing no reliance on
their loyal representation, Sarfaraz Khin treated thosetwo Generals
in a rude and.threatening manner, and by way of censure added :
“You opening s shop of gelf-aggrandisement deste that I should
be involved in war against Mahabat Jang, who is my well-wisher.”
Those two Generals got up blushing with shame and humiliation,
and returned to their own camps. Arming themselves, along with
their forces, they passed the night in alertness; whilst Sarfariz
Khan, in the slumber of heedlessness, lay intoxicated with the wine
of sleep. At the instigation of Haji Ahmad, in the dead of night,
under the pretext of visiting relations and friends, the officers
and soldiers of Mahabat Jang’s army, with their light baggages,
by ones and twos, mingled with the army of Sarfmaz Khan, and
forming rings round the Royal tent Jooked out for an opportunity
to strike.

The officers of Shnj‘é Khan’s regime, upon whom Sarfaraz
Khin placed great reliance, from the very beginning were in intri-
gue with the Haji, and seeing and knowing all connived at and
concealed the conspiracy; whilst the Joyal adherents of Sar-
faréz Khan held their tongue from fear of being snubbed. Whilst
one hour of the night yet remained, A‘li Vardi Khan and


--- Page 342 ---
315

Haji Ahmad divided their forces into two divisions. They detail-
ed one division under the command of Nandlal Jama‘dar, together
with the standard and the kettle-drum, and flags and elephants,
to attack Ghaugs Khan and Mir Sharfu-d-din, whilst with another
division, consisting of Afghan and Bhaliah troops, in the darkness
of the night, under the guidance of the men of the Zamindari of
Ramakant, Zamindar of Rajshahi, they themselves marched to
deliver a night-attack against Sarfaraz Khin. And towards the
day-break, whilst yet the darkness of the night contmued, and
friends could not be distinguished from foes, they suddenly, like
death, attacked Sarfariz Khan’s troops who were inebmated with
the wine of sleep, (which is akin to death), and fired their guns,
The old proteges awoke Sarfaraéz Khan from his slumber of neg-
lect, and apprised him of the aspect of affairs. As forinne, how-
ever, had averted its face from him, even now Sarfariiz Khan refus-
ed to listen to them with the ear of credence, snubbed them, and
again insisted on the quick preparation of viands for a banquet.
Sarfaraz Khan ! added, “ A‘li Vardi Khan is coming to visit me.”
At this moment, another cannon-shell fell ; and by the time of the
sunrise, the tioops of Mahabat Jang exhibited themselves in
battle-array. Guns and iorkets, arrows and muskets flashing
lightning, and showeiing destruction poured in. The troops of
Sarfaraz Khan who were intoxicated by the wine of the morning
sleep, harum-scarum sprang up from their beds of slumber, and
girding up their loins fled; whilst others, not commanding the
nerve to gird up their loins or to arm themselves, were butchered.
Sarfaréz Khan’s army was panic-stricken.

Yon might say, from dread of that warfare,
Earth itself had fled.

Only one solitary column consisting mostly of Sarfaraéz Khian’s
old officers, impelled by sentiments of honour, and animated by a
sense of loyalty, arrayed themselves on the battle-field, gallantly re-

1 Sarfariz Khin possessed a most guileless sonl, and his gnilelessness and
his confidence in A‘li Vardi cost him histhrone. Sarfariz Khin lacked insight
into human character, which is one of the essential attributes of a wise ruler.
Whilst noting this failing in Satfardz Khan, 1 must be added there ‘s nothing
to condone or extenuate the black ingratitude and treachery of A‘li Vardi
and the Triamvirate Councillors, Dewan Alamchand, Haji Alhmud and Jagat-
set, who were all protegea of Sarfaraz Khin’s father.

solved to sacrifice their lives, and firmly stood their ground, Nawab
Sarfariz Khan, after finishing his morning-prayer, also armed
himself, seized the Holy Qoran with one hand, and mounted a
swift elephant. Then letting loose the royal elephant in front
of himself, he flung himself into the thick of the fight, and com-
menced shooting arrows. The Afghan generals of Mahabat Jang’s
army, covered by a squadron of Bhalioh infantry, charged Sarfaraz
Khan’s army.

When on both sides, the troops stood in battle-array,
You might say, the Day of Judgment had arrived.
Owing to the thundering of guns, muskets and rockets,
Aye, the Universe itself quaked.

The twang of bow-strings and the cracking of arrows
Resounded aloft their echo to the lofty sky.

The spear, like Death with out-stretched hands,

Tn the taking of life, chopped the breast into slips.

In the hands of heroes, sharp steel. made swords,

In shedding blood of the enemy, leapt warmly

The heroes became waim in takmg and in giving hfe;
Aye, the world became emptied of heroes.

In this sword-charge, wherein the boisterous wind of Death
threw down on the plain of annilulation corpses like leaves of
trees, and the flood of blood raged tumultuously on every side,
Mardén A‘li Khan, the Bakhshi of Shuj‘a Khan's regime, who was
now the generalissimo of Sarfardz Khin’s army, and commanded the
vau, feeling himself incapable of continuing the contest auy longer,
fled. At the sight of this flight, Sarfariz Khin’s army was
demoralised, and a general stampede ensued in its ranks.

Bach one felt contented with saving himself,
No one cared for another.

Save and except his Georgian and Abyssinian slaves and a few
of his old comrades, not one out of the numerous mock-heroes re-
mained to cover Sarfaraz Khan’s elephant. The elephant-driver
perceiving that victory had declared itself for the enemy, said to
Sarfaraz Khan :—“Ifit be your Highness’s pleasure, I shall carry
you to Birbhiim to the Zamindar, Badi‘u-z-zaman.” Sarfaraz Khan,
striking the elephaunt-diiver a blow ou the neck, retorted: “ Tie
the chain round the feet of the elephant, as I will not retreat before

317

these dogs.”! The elephant-driver was obliged to drive on his
elephant. The Bargaudazes and the Bhalichs of the enemy's Army,
who had from before ranged themselves like a ring round Sarfaraz
Khin’s tent, discharged from all sides cannon-shells on his ele-
phant; and over and above, rockets and cannon-balls, arrows and
muskets were showered incessantly by the hostile army Mir
Gadai, who was a special favourite of Sarfaraz Khan, was shot
down by a rocket. MirKamil, brother of Mir Muhammad Baqir
surnamed Bagir A‘li Khan (nephew of Shuja‘n-d-daulah), and a
young unmarried boy of Mirzi Muhammad Iraj Khin Bakhshi,
and other personal attendants, including Bahram, Sa‘id and other
slaves, who had not fled from the batile-field, were hit by rockets,
cannon-shells and ballets, and fell right in front of Sarfaraz
Khan’s elephant. Mirza Iraj Khan was also mortally wounded.
Mir Diler A‘li gallantly attacked the Afghan column of A‘li Vardi
Khia, exhibited feats of prowess and bravery, but réceiving sword-
cuts gallantly fell with a number of his comrades

At this moment, Sarfaréz Khan himself was hit on the
forehead by the bullet of a gun shot by a traitor from his own
camp, and was felled on his elephant-litter,? and the bird of his
soul flew to Heaven. As soon as they saw this mishap, Mir Habib,
Murshid Quli Khan, Shamshir Khan Quraishi (Faujdar of Silhat)
and Rajah Ghandrab Singh, who with their forces stood aloof
at a distance from the battle, and were silent spectators of the
scene, took to their heels. Mir Haidar Shah and Khwijah Basant
who clung to each other, and were hiding themselves in a Rath,®
fled without even casting a glance at the corpse of their master.

Not one out of his companions remained,
To guard him for an instant,

In the cover of the darkness of the night, and deceived by the
ruse of the Royal Standard and the Hlephant being displayed by
the Division under Nandlal Jama‘dér, Ghaug Khan and Mir

I Though exceptionally humane and forbearing in disposition, it is refresh+
ing to note Sarfaraz Khan could fight and fall bravely like a hero.

Sharfuddin mistook the latter for Mahabatjang, and commenced
fighting. By means of Rustam-like onslanghts and brave assaults,
they lnlled Nandlal, and cut him up with their swords. Routing
those who escaped the sword, they captured the Standard, kettle-
dium, elephants, camels, horses and armaments, and then they
marched swiftly to enquire about Satfaraiz Khan. Though Sar-
faraz Khan had fallen, on seeing those two brave Generals, Maha-
bat Jang did not stir from the field, but with lis force which was
more numerous than ants and locusts remained stationary and
motionless on the battle-field. Those two Generals had yet received
no tidings of the fall of Sarfaraz Khan, and, therefore, with a small
force of veteran heroes comprising their sons, brothers, kinsmeu
and companions, they bravely spurred on their chargers, fiercely
assaulted Ali Vardi Khan’s army, broke throug its ranks, and
heroically dashed up to its centre. The army of Mahibat Jang was
about to 1eel from the blows of those lions of the forest of warfare,
when Ghans Khan received on the breast mortal wounds from the
bullets of Ghidan Hazdri’s musketeers, and fell. Ghaug Khan's
two sons, Qutb and Babar, who were veritable tigers of the forest
of bravery, and who on hunting-greunds were wont to slay lions
with swords, unsheathed their ‘swords, and killed a large number
of Afghans and Bhaliahs.!

They attacked no one whom they did not finish,

They struck no head which they did not hurl down,
On whomever they struck their long- piercing daggers,
His head came down rolling from the shoulder.

Qhidan Hazari also received sword-cuts at their hands,
After much slaughter and daring, being hit by the bullets of mus.
kets, Qutb and Babar fell like brave martyrs, and joined their
gallant father in his journey to Kternity. Mir Sharfu-d-din with
seven brave cavaljers galloped right up to Mahabat Jang, and
with great agility shot at the latter’s breast a heart-piercing
arrow, which, however, grazed against the bow of Mahabat Jang,
aud piercing through lodged itself in the latter's side-ribs. Mir
Sharfn-d-din had pulled another arrow towards the bow-string,
when Shaikh Jahan Yar and Muhammad Zulfugar, Mahibat
Jang’s Generals, who were old friends of the Mir, came forward
and said: “Naw&b Safariz Khan has fallen, what cnn you gain

1 It would seem the race of heroes was not yet extinot in Moslem Bengal.

319

now by continuing the contest and sacrificing your life” P The Mir
bravely replied: “ Hitherto T fought from a sense of loyalty for
the salé! I had eaten, and from a sense of comradeship, but
now I fight to maintain my honour.” These two Generals
stood sureties for the security of his honour, and pulled him
back. Then the Mir with his followers set out for Birbhiim.
Notwithstanding that his gunners had run away, Pancho Ferengi, #
Superintendent of Sa:faraz Khan’s artillery, served his guns and
bravely stuck to them, and kept up an incessant cannonade. After
Mir Shaerfu-d-din’s withdrawal, the Afghans in large numbers
attacked Pancho, and killed him. Baji Singh, a Rajput General,
who with the rear-guad was at Khamrah, on receiving news of
his master’s fall, felt his sense of honour aroused. Alone spurring
on his horse and placing his spear on his horse’s right ear, by
brave onslaughis, he.dashed through the enemy’s force to a point
where Mahabat Jang stood Whth one stroke of his sharp spear,
Baji Singh attempted to hurl the latter down from his elephant-
saddleand to despatch him to the next world, to be a companion there
of his fallen master. Mahabat Jang made him out on seemg his
heroism and agility, and ordered Daur Quli Khan, superintendent of
the artillery, to quickly oppose him. Daur Quli Khan encountering
him shot a bullet through his breast, and Baji Singh being mortally
wounded fell on the ground? Zalim Singh, Baji Singh’s son,
aged nine years, with that inherent bravery which is characteris-
tic of the Rajpit race, unsheathed his sword from the scabbard, and
stood up to guard his father. People from all sides surrounded
him like a ring. Nawab Mahabat Jang, on seeing the daring of
that boy, applauded him, and forbade the people from killing him,

1 Such instances of isolated loyalty and heroism relieve, to some extent, the
darkness of the picture of faithlessness and treachery thai these events portray.

& The ravenous hordes thus let loose on India made the race-name of
Ohristian (Fereng:) a word of terror, until the strong rule of the Mughal Im-
pire turned it into one of contempt.”—Sir W. Hunter’s History of British
India, Vol. I, p. 184, The name ‘Ferengi’ was, however, more especially
applied to the Portuguese settlers in India, whilst the term ‘Nasara’ (or
Nazarene) was a generic term for al Christians,

8 It is an eloquent testimony to the goodness of Sarfariz Khan, that even
fn those treacherous times, and in such a trying crisis, he could command the
undying devotion and homage of his brave Rajput officers. This is nnother
incident which relieves, in some megsure, the darknes# of the picture.

and ordered them not to oppose the removal of his father’s corpse.
The artillery-men helped in the removal of Baji Singh’s corpse, and
carried along with it Zalim Singh on their shoulders. During the
fightings of Ghaug Khan, Mir Sharfu-d-din, Baji Singh and Pancho
Ferengi, both the sons-in-law of Sarfaraéz Khan, named Ghazanfar
Husain and Hasan Muhammad, together with other Mansabdars
and vanquished soldiers, had fled from the battle-field, and had in
one day marched back to Murshidabad. And the Rai Raiin Alam-
chand, by way of retribution for his treachery, received an arrow-
shot on the hand from a crosi-bow, plunged into the river, and
half-dead reeched his house. Repenting of his disloyal treachery,
he committed suicide ' by swallowing diamond-filings. In short,
when Sarfariz Khiin was felled on his elephant-litter, the ele-
phant-driver carried his corpse swiftly to Murshidabid. Yasin
Khan, Faujdir of Murghidabid, who together with Hafiznu-l-lInh
Khan, son of Sarfaraz Khan, had been left to guard the City, the
Citadel and the Nawib’s family, buried at midnight the corpse of
Nawab Sarfariz Khan at Naktakhali. Hafigu-l-lah and Ghazan-
far Husain hurriedly threw up entrenchments, and prepared to
fight. They, however, received no encouragement from the van-
quished troops, and therefore abandoned their plan of fighting, and
tendered their submission to Ali Vardi Khan. This Revolution in
the Government threw the City, as well as the Army and the
people of Bengal, into a general and deep convulsion. Haji
Ahmad first* entering the city of Murshidabad, proclaimed peace

1 The Raf Raian Alamohand (the protége and creature of Sarfariz Khin’s
fathor Shuja‘u-d-din Khin) was after all a penitent sinner, and, therefore hig
character stands ont in a less hideons light, than that of Haji Abmad and Jagat
Set, who do not appear to have been similarly disturbed by qualms of conscience
for their black ingratitude and treachery.

& AN Vardi Khin himself entered the city of Murshidabad on the third day
after his victory. He was a Machiavellian diplomatist, and therefore, the
first step he took on his entry into the city, was to sue for pardon for hig
treachery from Nafisah Begam, a daughter of Shuja‘u-d-din Khin, and sistor
of Sarfaraz Khin. He next held a Darbar in the Ghehel Satun palace of
Shujé‘u-d-din Khin, and thongh at first he was detested hy the people and
the officers for his black ingratitude and treachery, he soon managed to
conciliate them by bestowing on them rich largeages. (See Seiru-t-Mutakherin,
Pers. text, p. 494), He appointed in his place as Naib Nazim of Patna
(Azimabad) his son-in-law, Zainn-d.din Khin Haihat Jang. (Bed p. 499,
Seiru-l-Mutakkerin).

and security on behalf of Ali Vardi Khan. Yasin Khan Fanjdar,
under the order of the Haji, set guards on Sarfaraz Khan's trea-
sury and family, officers and servants, as well as on his Seraglio,
so that none could escape. This battle! of Gheria took place in
1158 AH.

—————

NIZAMAT OF NAWAB ALI VARDI KHAN MAHA-
BAT JANG.

After obiaining victory, Ali Vardi Khan Mahiabat Jang, in
order to overlook the sacking of the City and the loot of Sarfaraz
Khan’s treasures at the hands of Afghans and Bhaliahs,* for
three days encamped outside the City, on the banks of the river
Gobrah. On the fourth day, with a sense of perfect security en-
tering the Citadel, he seated himself with extended thighs on the
masnad of the Nizamat of Bengal, and confiscated without any
trouble Sarfaraz Khan's treasures which the past Nazims with
considerable self-denial had hoarded. In that Nawab Mahabat
Jang avoided the company of strange women, and did not care
for this sort of pleasure, during his life he had only one wedded
wife, and in fact, he often plumed himself on this circumstance,
Haji Ahmad and his sons and relations possessed themselves of
Sarfaraz Khan’s fifteen hundred pretty female dependants and
slaves. Mahabat Jang banished to Jahangirnagar (Dacca) the
wedded Begams of Sarfaraz Khan with their children, * and fixed
small allowances for them from the income of the Khas Ta‘Iugah.

1 Compare the description of this battle with that given in the fetru-l-
Mutakherm, pp. 492-498. The author of the Seir, though a strong partisan
of Ali Vardi, and though anxtous to gloss over his treachery and ingratitude,
is forced to pay a glowing tribute to the bravery and devoted courage dis-
played by several officera of Sarfariz Khin at this battle. Riyas’s account of
this,important battle seems much rcher in details, as well as more graphic
and more exact than that of the Ser, This important battle took place about
11 months after Nadir Shah’s return to Persia after the sack of Delhi, and
about 14 months after Shuya‘u-d-din Khin’s death.

§ This fact which redounds to the discredit of Ali Vardi Khan is suppressed
by the author of the Seiru-l-Mutakkerin, whose father was employed in a high
capacity under Ali Vardi’s son-in-law, Zainu-d-din Khin, at Patna. Theauthor
of the Rryaz, not being a partisan, does not suppress it.

in the alleys of Dacca,

And Nafisalh Begam, Sarfariz Khan’s sister, who had adopted as
her child Aqi Baba Kiiohak who was her nephew, entered service
as a governess in the Seraglio of Nawazish Ahmad Khan, 1 the
eldest son of Haji Ahmad, and in this way supported her
nephew.

‘When news of the fall of Sarfaraz Khan and of the succession of
Ali Vardi Khan to the Masnad of the Nizimat of Bengal reached
Emperor Nasira-d-din Muhammad Shab, the latter wept and
said: “Owing to Nadir Shah, the whole of my Empire is con-
vulsed and shattered.”? But to mend the state of affairs was
difficult, and so the Emperor kept quiet. Mahabat Jang, through
Murad Khan, 8 who was one of the associates of the Prime
Minister, Nawab Qamru-d-din Khan (abouf whom mention has
been made before), intrigued with the Prime Minister and other
Ministers. He remitted to the Emperor forty laks of rupees on
account of Sarfaraéz Khan’s confiscated treasures and fourteen laks
on account of tribute, over and above the usual fixed revenue. He
also gave three laks of rupees to Qamru-d-din * Khin Vazir, and
one lak of rupees to Asaf Jah Nizimu-l-Mulk. He similarly con-
ciated and bribed other Imperial Officers according to their
ranks, Intriguing with Rijah Jugal Kishor, agent of Sarfaraz
Khan, Mahabat Jang obtained in hisown name the patent of the
Nigimat of all the three Sibahs of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa,
according to the usual practice. He then exacted double the usual

2 Emperor Mohammad Shih was not quite fair to Nadir Shah in his poli-
tical diagnosis, He ought to have added, the glorious Timuride Empire in
India had been shattered and undermined by the laxnry and love of ease, and
fatricidal jealousies and strifes of himself and his immediate predecessors,
and principally by the venality and corruption, joined to clannish jealousies
and personal ambitions that had seized the later Mughal ministers and pro-
consuls. A moral paralysis had seized the heart of the Empire at Delhi, and
it quickly extended to and affected its distant limbs in outlying Provinces.
The Musalmans m India had lost their Islamic virtues firat, and nest their
Empire; whilst Nadix Shih’s terri.le invasion operated only as an accelerat-
ing force towards its eventual dissolution,

8 He had been deputed by the Emperor to bring the attached treasures of
Sarfaraz Khan, and the revenue of Bengal. See Ser, p. 496.

4 It is humiliating to observe that even ministers of the calibre and position
of Qamru-d-din Khan and Nigimn-]-Mulk Asaf Jah were, at this dark period
of Indo-Moslem History, not above corruption.

amount of revenue, presents and tribute from the Zamindars of
Bengal.

For the purpose of overthrowing Murshid Quli Khan, ! and for
conquering the Sibah of Odisah (Orissa), Mahabat Jang now girded
up his loins, mobilised troops and collected armaments, and bes-
towed the office of Generalissimo on Mir Ja‘far Khan Bahadur,
who was Mahibat Jang’s brother-in-law, and who in the war with
Sarfaraéz Khan had rendered Mahabat Jang good services. Mah&bat
Jang bestowed on Mir Ja‘far a corps of bodyguard, together with a
mansab, a title, and a peerage. He bestowed the office of Diwan
with the title of Rai Raian on Chin Rai, * who was a clerk in charge
of the Jagirs of Ja‘far Khan, and who was a person of probity
and honesty. And he bestowed on Muhammed Rizaé Khan, the
eldest son of Haji Ahmad, who had married Ghasiti Khainam,
daughter of Mahabat Jang, the title of Naswru-l-Mulk Ihtashimu-
d-daulah Nawazish Muhammed Khau Bahadur Shahdmat Jang,
together with the nominal office of Diwin of Bengal, and the
Deputy Niz&émat of Jahangirnagar (Dacca), including Chittagong,
Raushanabad (Tipperah), and Silhat. And he bestowed -on

| He was a son-in-law of Shuja‘u-d-din Khin, and had been appointed by
the latter Depaty Nazim of Orissa, on the death of Muhammad Taqi Khan (a
son of Shuja‘n-d-din Khan). Ali Vardi and bis anholy Hiji brother were
resolved to spare no one amongst the capable male representatives of their
lnte master and benefactor. A yeign ushered in by such treachery and
characterised by such vindictive posthumous courtesies was bound, under
an Avenging Providence, to terminate ignominiously. The unholy Haji
brother quickly met with his proper deserts, by being tortured and batchered,
along with his son Zainu-d-din Khin, by the Afghan rabble who sacked
Patna. Ali Vardi himself was continually distracted and harassed by
Mahratta freebooters, who swooped down again and again on lus fair
provinces like armies of locusts, and harried and devastated them, fnd Ali
Vardi’s energy, coursge, and prowess were of no avail againat this visitation
of God’s curse Heat length had to conclude an inglorious pence with the
Mahrattas, and to practically cede to the latter the Province of Orissa And
not many montha had rolled away since he had closed his eyes, when his
favourite grandson, Siraju-d-daulah, was tortared to death, and Ali Vardi’sill-
gotten Satrapy dissolved for ever, and wns transferred to other handa.
Verily, Divine retribution was not slow in overtaking Ali Vardi Khan.

2 Qhin Rai was the Peshkar under tho Diwan Alam Qhand. Mahabat
Jang, on Alam Qhand’s death, appomted Qhin Rai as his Diwan. (See Ser,
p. 495). Ohin Rai proved very honest, and was held in gh esteem by
Mahibat Jang. (See Seir, p. 575).

Hashim Ali Khan, the youngest son of Haji Ahmad, who had
married the younger daughter of Mahibat Jang, named Amanah
Khanam, the title of Zainu-d-din Ahmad Khan Haibat Jang, to-
gether with the Deputy Nizimat of the Province of Bihar and
Azimabad (Patna), And he advanced to ranks, titles, and Jagirs
his other relations ! and connexions, according to their ranks and
aspirations. But the Afghans and the Bhaliahs, who owing to
their large numbers were haughty, meddled so much in all the
affairs, that they did not care for Mababat Jang, and deviated
from the usual forms of etiquette. Shelving the canons of justice
on the shelf of forgetfulness, they looted treasures, and ‘killed and
slaughtered the people, together with their women and children.
And the conduct of ingratitude, which had subsisted in the times
of the early Musalman Independent Kings of Bengal, reasserted
itself afresh from the time of Mahabat Jang.®

1The following details of the administrative arrangements made by Ali
Vardi Khan on his usurpation of the Nizimat of Bengsl, are summarized
briefly from the Sewu-l-Mutakherwm, p. 495. Zainu-d-din Ahmad Khan, Ali
Vardi’s youngest son-in-law, was appointed Subadar of Behar and Patna.
The Deputy Nuimat of Jahangirnagar, moluding the Faujdari of Silhat,
Chittagong, and Tipperah, was given to lus eldest son-in-law, Nawazish
Muhammad Khan. ‘I'he Deputy Nigamat of Orissa was bestowed on
his second son-in-law, Said Ahmad Khan (after Murshid Quli Khin was
defeated). The Superintendentship of the Nawarah or Imperial Fleet at
Jahangimagar (Dacca) was bestowed on his grandson, Mirza Mohammad
{son of Zamn-d-din Abmad Khan} survamed Siraja-d-daulah Shah Quli
Khan Bahadur. Siraju-d-daulah’s brother was adopted as a son by
Nawazish Muhammad Khin, and surnamed “ Ikramu-d-danlah Padshah Quli
Khin Bahadu: ” with nominal command of the Jahangirnagar or Dacca army.
Atau-l-lah Khan, a son-in-law of Haji Ahmad (Ali Vardi’s brother) waa
appoted Faujdir of Rajmahal (Akbarnagar) and Bhagalpnr. Alah Yar
Khan (step-brother of Ali Vardi), Mir Jafar Khin (brother-in-law of Ali
Vardi), and his other connexions like Faqiru-l-lah Beg Khan, Nural-lah Bog
Khan and Mustafa Khin were given mansaba and peerages with titles and
body-guards. Qhin Rai (Peshkar under Diwan Alamchand) received the
title of ‘ Rai Rasan,’ and was appointed Deputy Diwan of Bengal. Rajah Janaki
Ram, who was the old household Diwan of Mabdbat Jang, was appointed
Diwan of Miscellaneous departments. The Seir's author's maternal uncle or
Khaloo, Abdul Ali Khin (who was also a connexion of Ali Vardi), received a
mangab, together with the parganahe of Nahat Samai and Behar,

Towards the commencement of the insurrectionof Alz Vardi
Khan Mahabat Jang, Nawab Sarfariz Khan had asked for help
from Murshid Quli Khan, the Governor of Odisah (Orissa), who
was his brother-in-law; but the latter, owing to personal spite
which has been referred to before, had delayed to march to his
help. Whilst Murshid Quli was occupied with despiichings »
body of troops in the shape of ananuxiliary force, he suddenly
received news of Sarfaraz Khan’s fall and of Ali Vardi Khiin's
mastery over the Sabah of Bengal. It was then that Murghid
Quli Khan woke up from slumber, and was plurged into sha,mo
and sorrow.

General well-being follows mutual union, !
General ruin follows disunion.

In short, from fear of Ali Vardi Khan, Murshid Quli Chin
made preparations in self-defence, and exerted himedf stremous-
ly towards the mobilisation of an army, and deputed to Murshidi-
bad Mukhialig Ali Khan, son-in-law of Haji Alamd, who from
before was in his company, in order to arrange the basis of a
treaty of peace, After the latter’s arrival, Ali Vardi Khan and
Haji Ahmad sending @ reassuring and diplomatic messige to
Marshid Quli Khan, set him at ease? aud sent back Mulhdlis
Khan, in order to sow treassqn secretly amongst the Officers of
Murshid Quli Kban’s army. Mukhalis Khin presenting himsdf
before Murshid Quli Khan outwardly tried to humow and rm
assure him, but covertly by offer of allurements and temptations
sowed sedition in Murghid Quli’s army, and sent anaccouratof his
success in this direction to Ali Vardi Kyain Mahabat Jang. ‘The
latter, with a large army and an immense artillery, imsiantly
marched towards the Province of Orissa, On receipt of this news,
leaving his wife, Durdinah Begam, and his som, Yahya Chi

with his treasures iu the fort of Barahbati,! Murshid Quli Khan
with an efficient force and requisite war-paraphernalia, together
with his two sons-in-law, named Mirza Muhammad Baqir® Khan,
a Prince of Persia, and Alau-d-din Muhammad Khan, marched out
from Katak (Cuttack) in order to fight, and advanced to the
port of Balisir (Balasor) At the ferry of Phulwar, from the
rock of Tilgadhi 8 to the river Jon,* he threw up an entrenchment,
and remained behind it waiting for the enemy. Unfortunately,
Murshid Quli Khan was ignorant of the wiles of the traitor in his
own camp in the person of Mukhialis Ali Khan, and had, therefore,
failed to take any precautionary steps againat that double-faced
scoundrel, and had thus ignored the saying of Shaikh Sa‘di$:—

1 “The construction of Fort Barabati has been assigned to various mon“
archs with varions dates. Sterling thinks it was built by Rajah Anang Bhem
Deva in the fourteenth century. The stonework has been taken by the Public
Works Department to build lighthouses and hospitals, and to pave roads. The
ditch of the fort, however, still remains, and so does the gate, which is still
approached by s causeway... Rajah Mukund Deo built s palace here with
nine courts... The palace was in time abandoned by the Musalman Governorg
who preferred to live in the Lalbagh, on the south side of the city, (now Com-
missioner’s Residence ”)—-Wilson’s Harly Annals of the English in Bengal,
Vol. f, p. 4, fn.

% There is still a mahkalla or quarter in Katak, oalled ‘Bakrabad,’ named

"  B Tilgadhi in the text is apparently » mistake for the hill ‘ Tahirmunda’
marked on the maps of Orissa, near Balasore.

4 ‘Jon’ in the text is also obviously a mistake; I do not find any river of
that name near Balasore or in Orissa. It is a mistake probably for the river
near Balasore, called ‘ Nuniajuri,’ Balasore ibself being situated on the Bura-
balung river.

b In Setru-l-Mutakherin (p. 407), it is stated Murshid Qoii Khiin passed
through Balasore port, and encamped on the banks of its river, in the Mouzs, of
Bhalwar The encampment 1s desoribed in the Sew as being Aanked by dense
forests on one side, and by deep rivulets on another, A ring with artillery was
formed round this encampment, Ali Vardi Khin passing through Mednipur
and Julasore, took up a position on the north banks of the Burabalung river.
The position taken up by Murshid Quli Khin is desoribed ag very impregnable,
and he might not have been dislodged from it, but for the rash sally of his
son-in-law, Mirza Baqir Ali Khan, and the trenchery of his Afghin General ;
‘Abid Khiin, who deserted Murghid Quli Khan, his old master and benefactor,
and joined with his Afghin contingent Mustafa Khin, the Afghan General of
Ali Vardi Khin. The crafty Ali Vardi Khin had by means of bribes sown
treason amongst the Afghin troops of Murshid Qali Khin (497 Seir),

‘If thy relative be thy enemy, treat him outwardly a thy
friend,

But never be heedless of his treachery.

For inside his heart, wound festers from thy envy,

Whenever he thinks of the love-shackles of kinship.’

Advancing from Bengal by forced marches with a large army,
which numbered more than one lak cavalry and infantry, Ali
Vardi Khin reached Mednipir, secured the adhesion of the
Zamindars of that district by bestowing on them Khila‘ts and
gifts, and encamped at Jalisar (Jalasore), which was an Imperial
outpost, On the banks of the river Sabaurikha,! at the ferry of
Rajghat, Rajah Jagardhar Bhanj, Zamindar of Morbhanj,? had
established a garrison of his Qhawars and Khandaits, and had
erected entrenchments. To cross, therefore, at the ferry of
Rajghaét which was protected by dense jungles and thorny trees,
was found to be a difficult operation, and therefore, Ali Vardi
Khan had to ask for help from the Rajah. The Rajah, however,
was haughty owing to his‘command of a large army, and did
not care for Ali Vardi Khan. He refused to side with the
latter, or to permit him to cross at the Rajghai ferry. Ali
Vardi Khan placing his artillery-waggons in front of the Rajghat
ferry, commenced bombarding it. The Rajah’s army were unable
to hold the ground in their entrenchment, and fled to the jun-
gles. Ali Vardi Khan with troops and artillery crossed over
at Rajghat, and encamped at Ramohandarpur which ‘was at a
distance of one and a half %aroh from Murshid Quli Khin’s
encampment. Emissaries and envoys were busy for some days
moving to and fro with messages of peace and war, and this sort
of diplomatic parley lasted for one month, All this time Murghid
Quli Khan ® did not advance across theferry of Phulwar. Having

8 As another interesting and remarkable illustration of the potent influence
in polities and society exercised by Musalman ladies m Bengal, even towards
the middle of the eighteenth century, 11 may be noted that Murshid Quli
Khan himself was averse to fight with Ali Vardi Khin, owmg to a sense of
feebleness, but that his brave wife, Dordanah Begam, encouraged and mspired
him to fight, in order to avenge her brother Sarfarig Khian’s fall, and threat-

regard to the wasteful expenditure on account of a huge army
thus locked up, and viewing the dearth of provisions, and apprehend-
ing the approach of the rainy season as well as the raids of Mah-
ratte, freebooters, Ali Vardi Khan thought it expedient to patch up
peace, andreturn But Mustafa Khan, generalissimo of Ali Vardi's
Afghin contingent, not acquiescmg in peace, suggested en-
tionchments being thrown up during the rains, After a Council of
War, it was decided after much deliberation to send a soothing mes-
sage to Murshid Quli Khan through a trastworthy envoy, who was
instructed to get back a reply in the following form:—*I shall
not allow you authority or possession over the Siibah of Odisah,”
and then with this document to return to Bengal, and after the
rainy season, again mobilising troops, to re-attempt Murshid Quli
Khan's subjugation./ Although ‘Abid Khan and other Afghan
Generals, owing to the sedition sown amongst them by Mukhaligs
Ali Khan, treacherously advised Mirzi Bagqir Khan, who com-
manded the vanguard of Murshid Quli Khan’s army, to give bat-
tle by advancing out of the entrenchment, Murshid Quli Khan
remained on the defensive, and dissuaded Mirza Baqir from
attempting a sally. But as the period of stay within entrenchments
was tediously protracted, Mirzi Baqir, carried by his youthful im-
pulsiveness, salhed out with his contingent composed of Syeds of
Barha, and arrayed himself in battle-rank. Murshid Quli was,
therefore, obliged to array his troops in front of Ali Vardi Khin’s
army. On both sides, the battle opened with a cannonade, which
was soon abandoned for a sword and spear-charge at close quarters.
Murshid Quli Khan’s generalissimo, Mir Abdu-l-‘Aziz, who com-
manded the van, and his devoted contingent of three hundred
knights consisting of Syeds of Barha spurred on their chargers,
exhibited feats of heroism and hereditary gallantry, and with the
flashing of their lightning swords ignited the life-harvests of all
whose moment for death had arrived..Before this gallant charge,
Ali Vardi Khan's soldiers, who had hitherto fancied themselves
Hons of the forest of bravery, fled hke sheep from the battle-field,

Vardi Khan with his Begam1! was mounted, was withdrawn
half a farsakh away from the battle-field. At this crisis, Mukhalis
Ali Khan and Abid Khan surnamed Farzand Ali Khn, upon
whose loyalty Murshid Quli Khan reposed implicit confidence,
together with Muqarrab Khan and other Afghan generals, ex-
hibiting treachery which is the characteristic of the Afghan
race, effaced from the tablets of their hearts all the alphabets of
oblipations that had been engraved thereon by many years of shel-
ter and salt-eating, deserted the side of Murshid Quli Khan, and
retired from the battle-field. At this juncture, Manikchand,*
Peshkar of the Rajah of Bardwin, who had arrived with an ap-
propriate auxiliary force to serve under Ali Vardi Khan, reflect-
ing that results of war were dubious, and speculating \about the

1 This is a remarkable incident illustrating that Musalman ladies in India
had not yet all taken to the existing form of seclusion, nor ceased to take an
active share in their husbands’ burdens, both in peace and war. Tndeed, it is
interesting to note that Ali Vardi’s Begam played the réle of Supreme Politi-
cal Officer, whilst her husband fonght the battles with the Mahrattas. It is
stated in the Seiru-l-Mutakherwn (Pers. text, p. 650), that one day Ali Vardi at
Patna after fighting with the Mehrattas under Raghoji Bhosla, entered the
Begam’s boudow with an anxious look. The Begam enquired what the mat-
ter was, when Ali Vardi replied that this time he feared treachery from his
own soldiers and officers, Thereon, the Begam on her own initiative and her
own responsibility organised a political mission, and sent it to Raghoji’s
camp, to arrange for a treaty of peace. Raghoj: fell in with the proposal:
but his Chief Adviser, Mir Habib, dissuaded him, and advised him to make a
dash for Murshidabad, holding out the prospect of loos The Begam must
have been a lady of keen judgment and uncoramon sagacity to have been
relied upon at such a crisis by her shrewd husband.

8 Manikohand who was afterwards left as Governor of Calcutta, when
Siraju-d-daulah conquered it, was & shrewd and time-serving man, and regulat-
ed his loyalty by prudentaal considerations. He was a prototype of Nubo-
kighen of later times, of whose loyal assistance to the English so much has of
Inte been made by a recent writer, but who only followed Manikchand in his
loyal tactics, feeling his way cautiously, and keenly watching which way the
tide of success turned, in order to adjust his individual position with an eye to
self-aggrandisement. The Sair makes no mention of Minikchand having
taken any part in the battle, and ascribes Mnishid Quii Kiin’s disaster to
the treachery of his Afghan general ‘Abid Khan, and to the rash sally of his
son-in-law, Mirzi Biqw Ali Khién At this battle near Balasore, the Syeds
of Barha fought bravely on the side of Murshid Quli Khan, and several of
them, such eas Mir Ali Akbar and Mir Mujtahe Ali fell, whilst Miraé Baqu
AliKha himself was severely wounded. (See Sen, p. 497.) ,

future, covertly humoured Murshid Quli Khan, and asked for
the latter’s flag of truce, in order to jomhim and exhibit self-
sacrifice and loyalty. From a side of the forest, towards the
direction whence the force of Mirza Bagir Khan was marching
in pursuit of Ali Vardi Khan, Manikchand shewed himself, and
displayed Murshid Quli Khan’s flag. Inasmuch as the afore-
said Mirzi was unaware of his aim, he opposed his progress.
Manikchand was obliged to fight. Mirz4 Bagir’s efficient soldiers
were already exhausted by warfare, so they fought in broken
lines, and by the viccisitudes_of times, the corps of Mirza Baqir
was defeated, Ali Vardi Khan, on being apprised of this,
huniiedly collected his vanquished troops by use of persuasions,
and a second time engaged in fighting. Mir Abdu-l-‘Aziz and
his corps, consisting of three hundred Syed knights, dismount-
ing from their horses, and girding up their loins of bravery,
marched to the battle-field, and one by one, all of them fell, being
shot down by bullets fired by the Bhaliah corps. Murshid Quli
Khan being thus defeated retired! to the Port of Balisar (Bala-
sore), and there embarking on a sloop which had been kept
ready from before, he sailed for the Dakhin, and presented him-
self before Nawab Agaf Jah.? A providential victory thus fell to
the good fortune of Ali Vardi Khan Mahabat Jang. The latter
pursued the vanquished army up to the Port of Balasore. From
there, he detached Mirzé Khairu-I-lah Beg, Faqiru-l-lah Beg,

1 Tt is stated in the Ser that after us defeat at the battle of Balasore,
Marshid Quli Khin together with his son-in-law, Mirai Bagr Ali Khiin, with-
drew to tha town of Balasore, with two or three thousand troops. Apprehend-
ing treachery from the latter, he gave out that he would entrench himself
in the town, told them off to some distance to guard the roads leading to the
town, whilst he himself with Mirzi Bigir Ali moved towards the sea-shore,
At this time it so happened that a friend of his, Hiji Mohmn, a merchant of
Surat, had his mercantile ship in the port, and alsoa pinnace. Murshid Quli
Khin got to the pinnace along with Mirzi Bigir Ali and Haji Mohsin and
some servants, embarked on board the ship, which sailed down to Masuli-
patam. From Masulpatam, Murshid Quli Khin sent Mirzi Bagir Ali to-
wards Sikakul and Ganjam, to bring away Durdanah Begam and her danghter
from Katak (Cuttack),

and Niru-l-lah Beg to capture Yahya Khan! and Murshid
Quli’s Begam, and also to seize his treasures and chattels. Ali
Vardi instructed them to proceed by forced marches, whilst he
himself followed them on horse-back. When news of this affair
and of Muishid Quli Khan’s retreat te the Dakhin reached Katak
(Cuttack), Mirad Khan, the generalissimo of the Rajah * of Parsi-
tam (Pur1), who had been detailed for guarding Yahya Khan and
the Begam in the Fox of Barahbati, planned to send instantly
the Begam and Yahya! Khan together with all their chattels
aud treasures to the Dakhin, by way of Sikakil.$ Baggages
and equipages were kept ready, and jewelleries, gold coins,
treasures, and other precious things were loaded on elephants,
camels, and waggons, when all of a sudden the army of Ali
Vardi Khan made its appearance. The elephant and camel-
drivers, &c., leaving behind the loaded treasures and chattels with
their baggages, fed, and all those treasures fell into the hands
of the aforesaid Mirzas, who divided the precious jewelleries,

south-west of Puri. The Jand-route from Orissa to the Dakhin lay in olden
days wd Sekakul or Qhicacole across the Ohilka lake. It is stated in the
Sew that after arrival at Masulipatam, Murshid Quli Khan sent his son-
in-law, Mirzi Bigir Ali Khan, towards Sekaknl and Ganjam, to proceed to
the relief of Durdanah Begam and her daughter In the meantime, on hear-
ing of Murshid Quli Khin’s defeat, Murshid Quli’s frend, Hafiz Qadir, Rajah
of Ratipu1, Khardih, who was Superintendent of the temple of Jagannath,

this time, Mirza Bagir Ali Khin reached Inchapm, and proceeded from there

treastires, and other valuable wares amongst themselves.! Since
Ali Vardi Khan also followed up subsequently, he captured the
remaining treasures, and also confiscated other treasures of the
adherents of Murshid Quli Khan. Issuing proclamations of
peace and security, and employing reassurances and persuasions,
Ali Vardi Khan won over to his side the Collectors, Zamindars
and Officers of Orissa, and set about making settlement of the
revenue, nazar, and tribute, as well as of the Jagirs. And in
the course of one month, having finished the organisation and
settlement of the Sibah of Orissa, he entrusted the charge of that
Province to Said Ahmad Khan, his nephew, who had previously
served as the Faujdar of Rangpir, procuring for him from the
Emperor the title of Nagiru-l-Mulk Said Ahmad Khan Bahadur
Saulat Jang. Ali Vardi Khan also left Gujar Khan, a Rohilla
general, together with a contingent of three thousand cavalry
and four thousand infantry, to be in attendance on Said Ahmad
Khan at Katak (Cuttack). Ali Vardi Khan then returned,
triumphant and victorious, to Bengal.

Saulat Jang was of a churlish disposition and regulated himself
by avarice. For effecting retrenchment in the military expendi-
tare, he took into his service Salim Khan, Darvésh Khan, Nia‘mat
Khan, Mir A‘zizu-l-lah and other generals,and sent back Gujar
Khan * to Murshidabad, on the plea of smallness of the revenue of

1 It would appear the account in the Set; u-l-Mutakheri, as regarda the fate
of the Begams and their treasure is somewhat different from that in the Rryaz,
whivh states that the Begams’ treasures and effects were captured by Ali
Vardi Khan’s officers. ‘he Riyaz ia, however, strangely silent as to the fate
of the Begams who were with the treasures. Obviously, the account in the
Riyaz is incomplete and halting, whilat that of the Sew is more consistent
and comprehensive and, therefore, more acceptable.

% The account in the Sew 1s somewhat different from that in the Riyaz,
In the Seu, it is stated, in pursuance of a policy of economy, Saulat Jang
wanted to reduce the pay of his soldiers. This reduction in pay was resent-
ed by the Murghidabad troops and officers who in cousequence were disband-
ed, whilst the soldiers and officers domed in Ornesa accepted this reduced
pay, and in consequence were enlisted inthearmy in large numbers. Sanlit
Jang subsequently, at the instigation of one Shah Yaheao indulged in deban-
cheries and ill-treated the men and women of Katak, who all in consequence
were disgusted with him. ‘This stato of affairs at Katak came to the notice
of Mirza Bagir Ali, who was in the Dakhia, ‘Ihe latter asked Murghid Quli
Ehin to invade Onssn, but Murgh:d Quli demmred. Thereon, Mirza Bagir

Katak. The aforesaid generals who were anxious to avenge the
fall of their old master, Murshid Quli Khan, finding now an oppor-
tunity, broke out into 1evolt. Saulat Jang sent to them Qasim
Bég, Superintendent of the Artillery, and Sheikh Hidaitu-1-lah,
Faujdar (Magistrate) of Katak, for effecting the basis of a recon-
ciliation. The Generals, who were seeking for an opportunity,
finding the above two emissaries unescorted, slew Qasim Bag,
whilst Hidaitu-l-lah, after receiving some wounds, made his
escape. The citizens and soldiers en masse broke out into revolt,
and under cover of the darkness of night they besieged Saulat
Jang, took him prisoner along with his followers and relations,
and looted his treasures and effects. Then invitimg over Mirza
Baqir Khan, son-in-law of Murghid Quli Khan, from Sikakil
across the Qhilkah lake, they placed him on the masnad of the
Niza&mat of Orissa, and advancing with their forces they conquer-
ed. Mednipir and Hijli.

The news of the approach of the Katak army threw Bengal into
commotion. Ali Vardi Khan, on the occurrence of this dis: ster)
mobilised an imthéense army equipped with a battering artillery,
and then set out for Katak, in order to relieve Saulat Jang and
re-conquer Orissa. By forced marches, scouring through Bardwin,
he encamped on the outskirts of Mednipir. On receiving news
of the approach of Mahabat Jang, the Katak army,! which was
spread at Hijliand Mednipir, concentrated at Mednipiir and Jalisar,
next crossed over at the ferries of Rajghat and Phulwar, and then
encamped? at the Port of Balasore. The soldiers of Mirza Bagir,

who had previously received arrow-shots at the hands of the
Bhaliahs, suddenly Jost heart, and sending all their baggages to
Sikakul remained unencumbered. When Mirza Bagir came to know
of the disloyalty and cowardice of his soldiers, ostensibly he gave out
that he contemplated advancing against the enemy, but in reality
he planned to withdiaw to the Dakhm Whilst completing his
arrangements for withdrawal to the Dakhin, he detached a force
to Ghaprah! ghat, which 1s the ferry of the river Mahandi and is
situate midway the town of Katak, And he himself with Saulat
Jang, &c , and a number of other captives together with tents, &c.,
crossed the river Katjuri. Mahabat Jang was encamped on the
banks of the river Kamhariah,? at a distance of forty Karoh from
Katak, and there at midnight messengers bought bim news of
Mirza Baqir’s flight. Immediately summoning Mir Muham-
mad Ja‘far the generalissimo, Mustafa Khan, Shamshir Khan,
Sardar Khan, ‘Umar Khan, Buland Khin, Sirindaz Khin, Balisar
Khan and other Afghan generals, and holding a Council of
War, Ali Vardi that very mght with their concurrence despatched
them expeditiously under the command of Mir Ja‘far Khan to
pursue Mirza Baqir Khan. Soon after, Ali Vardi Khan himself
with the remainder of his army set ont. When the aforesaid
generals with their army arrived five karoh from Katak, Mirza
Baqir Khan being apprised placed Saulat Jang in a fringed Rath,
placed in it Haji Muhammad Amin, brother of Murshid Quli
Khan, with a drawn dagger, to be his companion and attendant,
and also set two armed horsemen on two sides of the Rath, with

Amanat Khin, Mir Kazim Khan, Bahadur Ali Khin. Ali Vardi reached with
his army the northern banks of the Mahanadi river opposite to Katak town,
whilst Muza Baqir Ali was encamped with his troops on the southern
banks of the same river. Seeing Ali Vardi’s huge army, Mirza Bagir Ali’s
soldiers fled, and dispersed in all directions, whilst Ali Vardi's troops planged
gnto the river, qmckly crossed over to Katak town (at the Jobra Ghat, as
would appear from the Reyaz), and resoued Saulat Jang who was encaged mm a
Rath (a four-wheeled carriage) covered over with a white sheet tied ronnd ib
with white strings. Sasulat Jang’s esbape from certain death was almost
miracnlous.

ing Saulat Jang he left the La‘l Bagh! Palace situate in the city
of Katak, and arrived at Malisir.* At this time, Balisar Khan
with fifteen horsemen, who were his comrades, came up. The
flags carried by the cavalry were visible in the forest. By chance:
at that time, from the excessive heat of summer, Saulat Jang
changing his seat inside the Math sat in the place where Haji
Muahammad Amin had hitherto sat, and gave his own seat to
the Haji. At the very sight of the flags of Balisar Khan’s caval-
ry, the two armed horsemen whe rode alongside- the Rath thrust
their spears through the Rath—screen, wounded Haji Muhammad
Amin whom they mistook for Saulat Jang, and fled. As fate
would have it, as soon as the spear-thrust pierced the Haji’s hand
and shoulder, the Haji’s dagger fell from his hand, and shouting
out, “ you have killed me; you have killed me,” the Haji® tum-
bled down inside the Rath. Saulat Jang, the cup of whose life
was not yet full to the brim, remained unscathed. When the
Afghan troops were busy looting the vanquished, Mir Muhammad
Ja‘far Khan Bahadur and Muhammad Amin* Khan Bahadur,
with a few men fell in with the runaways, and moved in every
direction in quest of Sa‘id Ahmad Khan Bahadur Saulat Jang; but
Saulat Jang fearing lest some enemy might be searching for him,

« Mir Muhammad Amin was a step-brother of Ali Vardi Khin, snrnamed
Mehabat Jang, and brother-in-law of Mu Jafar, the latter having married an
uterine sister of Mir Muhammad Amin. Neither Ali Vardi nor his father was
a Syed; they were Mirzas; and therefore, Muhammad Amin (Ali Vardi’s step-
brother) could not have been a Syed or Mir from his father’s side, he wis 80
probably from lus mother’s side. It is common amongst Muhammadans (and
the usage has the sanction of authority) to call themselves Syeds, if their
mothera are Syedas.

held his breath quietly. When Muhammad Amin Khan came
up quite close, Saulat Jang, recognising his voice, answered him,
The aforesaid Khan, on hearing the response, immediately tearing
the soreen of the Rath, and entting up the tent-ropes bronght
out Saulat Jang, and dismounting from his horse embraced
him. And Mir Muhammad Ja‘far Khan also coming up, they
embraced each other, and after offering thanks to Providence
for the safety of Saulat Jang’s life, they indulged in jubila-
tions. At the time when they were busy with embracings and
hand-shakings, Haji Muhammad Amin, finding an opportunity,
nimbly got out of the Rath, and mounting the horse of Muham-
mad Amin Khan fled to the jungle and vanished. When
after enquiries into the condition of Saulat Jang they mounted
their own horses, Muhammad Amin Khan was confounded at
the disappearance of his own horse. On subsequently ascertain-
ing the sccret, they were all sorry. When the Afghan soldiery,
after timshing their work of plunder and sack, rallied round
Mir Muhammad Ja‘far Khan, they sent Saulat Jang to Mahabat
Jang, whilst they themselves set out in pursuit of Mirza Muham-
mad Baqir. Finding the chance of his escape to be slender, the
Mirz& beame desperate, and opened the battle by shooting rockets
and arrows and firing muskets. When the fighting was about to
turn to a charge with spears and swords, Muriid Khan, the genernl-
issimo of the Rajah of Pari,* who with a large contingent of troops
supported Mirza Bagir, seizing the rein of the Mirza’s horse, and
by use of great persuasion, pulled him back from the battle-field.
Becoming his guide, Murad Khan led the Mirza by a ronte across
the forest towards the Dakhin. Ali Vardi Khan, after holding
a thanksgiving service for meeting Saulat Jang and obtaining
victory, allowed Saulat Jang to retire to the city of Katak for rest,
whilst he himself, after resting some time and being freed from all
anxiety on account of the enemy, entered Katak triumphantly.
And after chastising fully the adherents and friends of Mirza
Bagir, Ali Vardi confiscated all the branded® horses of Miizd

the office of Deputy Nazim of the Sabah of Odisah (Orissa), and
after finishing the administrative arrangements of that Province
returned to Bengal.

Tnasmuch as Jagat Isar, Rajah of Morbhanj, had taken sides
with Mirzi Bagqir, and had not submitted to the authority of
Mahabat Jang, the latter was in anxiety owing to his insolence.
Therefore, on arrival at the port of Balasore, he girded up his
loins in order to chastise the Rajah. ‘The latter was at Harihar-
pir which contained his mansion, and was at the time plunged in
pleasures aud amusements. His knowledge of the denseness
of the forests that surrounded him, coupled with his command
of numerous hordes of Ghawars* and Khandaits, made him feel inso-
lent, aud so he did not pull out the cotton of heedlessness from
the ear of sense, nor cared for the army of Ali Vardi Khan. Ali
Vardi Khan’s army stretching the hand of slaughter and
rapine, set about looting and sacking the populations, swept the
Rajah’s dominion with the broom of spoliation, captured the
women and children of the Khandatis and Qhawars, and sowed dis-
sensions amongst them. The Rajah, seeing the superiority of Ali
Vardi Khan’s army, with his effects, followers and dependants, fled
tothe top of a hill, and hid himself in a secret fastness, beyond
the ken of discovery. Ali Vardi Khin then subjugated the
tract of Morbhanj, shewed no quarter, and mercilessly carried fire
and sword through its limits,

Pati.” He was appointed Deputy Governor of Orissa, in the place of Satilat
Jang, on the recommendation of Ali Vardi's Afghin general, Mustafa Khan,

pillars of the State in Bengal, towards the middle of the eighteenth centary,
in order to avenge Ali Vardi’s overthrow of his master Murghid Quli Khan

latter’s defeat, had gone to Raghoji Bhoslah, and persuaded the
latter to undertake the conquest of Bengal. At this time, Raghoji
Bhoslah, nephew of the Rajah of the Dakhin, was Governor of
the Sibah of Berar. Taking advantage of the circumstance that
Mahabat Jang was occupied with the affairs of Orissa, and find.
ing that the whole extent of Bengal was denuded of troops, Raghoji
Bhoslah detached his generalissimo, Diwan Bhaskar Pandit, and
Ali Qarawal, who was an able general, with a contingent of sixty
thousand Mabratta cavalry from Nagpar, in the company of Mir
Habib, by the route across the forest, in order to invade and pil-
lage Bengal. On receiving news of the approach of Mahratta
freebooters, Mahibat Jaug abandoned the pursuit of the Mor-
bhanj Rajah, and withdrew towards Bengal.

As yet Ali Vardi Khan had not passed through the forests of
Morbhanj, when the army of Mahbratia freebooters swooped down
from the direction of the chaklah of Bardwan.! Mahabat Jang,
with the celerity of lightning and wind, marching swiftly by night
and day, reached the inn of Ujalar adjoining to Bardwan. The
armies of Mahratta freebooters, concentrating from different
directions, commenced looting baggages and tents. The Ben-
gal army, which was ignorant of the tactics of Mahratta free-
booters, but which had heard tales about their barbarity and rava-
ges, stood motionless from fear like an army of statues, and were
hemmed in and attacked by the freebooters. Their baggages
were looted, and their food-supplies were cutoff. Horses, elephants,
and camels of the Bengal army were captured, and carried off by
the freebooters. The army of Mahabat Jang, being tired out by
the devastating onslaughis and sieges of the freebooters, broke
in disorder. The Mahrattas at once hemming in attacked the

Mahratta freehooters, in order to place the Moslem Satrapy in Bengal under
Mahratta heels. The story is an object-lesson, and illustrates the intellectual
and moral desolation that had seized Musalmans in Bengal at the time.

1 It is related in the Seiru-1-Mutakherin (Pers. text, p. 507), whose author's
father, Syed Hedait Ali Khin, was at the tame employed as Fanjdar of Magha
in Behar, and was on an expedition to the hill-passes of Ramgarh, that the
Mahratta cavalry numbering 40,000 led by Bhaskar Pandit, genoral of Rag-
hoji Bhoslah, swooped down through the above passes, out through Pachit and
Morbhanj, and appeared near the outskirts of Mednipir. Raghoji Bhoslah
(miscalled in the Pers printed text of the Riyez, Raghoji Ghoslah) was a
nephew of Rajah Saho and Makasder (probably Governor or Chief) of the
Subah of Berar, and his capital was at Nagpur in the Central Provinces.

ed, and capturing the elephant dragged it towards their own camp.
Musahib Khin Mohmand,* son of U‘mar Khan the General,
having his Hindustini courage aroused in him, attacked tlie
freebooters, and advancing his feet of valour and gallaniry, by
means of valorous onslaughts and Rustam-like onsets, rescued the
elephant together with its fair rider from the clutches of the free-
booters. In consequence, however, of numerous mortal and
ghastly wounds that they received, Mugahib Khan and a large
number of his comrades and kinsmen drew the red paint of
martyrdom on the face, and on that very spot of slaughter were
buried. And when the freebooters from impudence and insolence
made onslaughts from all sides, Mah&bat Jang, of necessity,
opened leathern bags of coins, and scattered them on the field.®

1 It is interesting to note that we saw Ali Vardi Khin’s Begam moving
beside her husband on an elephant at the battle of Balasore, and we find her
again by the side of her husband at this battle with the Mahrattas, near
Bardwin. She must have been a lady not only of nerve, but of wisdom, to
have been retained by his side asa companion by AH Vardi at such critical
junctures. We saw also that that iron-man Ali Vardi in his usurpation of
the Bengal Nizamat, bended himself before Nafisah Khinam and sued for
pardon from her. From such incidents, the mference is not withont warrant
that Musalman ladies in Bengal even towards the middle of the eighteenth
century occupied a different position from what they occupy now, took an
active part in the wider concerns of their husbands, and exercised a powerful
and. beneficent influence hoth in the domains of politics and Society.

tribe.

8 The Setru-l-Mutakkerin (Pers. text, pp. 607-518) gives a very graphic
description of this first Mahratta, invasion of Bengal (1155 A.H.), and of the
causes which rendered i possible, The first cause was the instigation of Asif
Jah (of Mir Habib, according to the Riyaz which seems more probable; for
Asif Jah was too high-minded to set loose Mahratta freebooters on a Musal.
man satrapy); the second cause was the discontent of Ali Vardi Khin’s
Afghan troops and officers, notably of Mustafa Kh&n, as Ali Vardi Khan had
disbanded many Afghan levies after the Katékexpedition to rescue Sanlat Jang;
the third cause was the treacherous assassination by Ali Vardi of the Rajah of
Morbhanj, whose cause was espoused by Mustafa Khin. The Sew further
states that when Bhaskar Pandit reached near Bardwin vid Pachit with
25,000 cavalry (given out as 40,000 cavalry), Ali Vardi Khin was on his way
back from Orissa at Midnapur, with only 4 or 5,000 cavalry and 4 or 5,000
infantry, the latter having ordered back all hs other troops to Murshidabid
with Saulat Jang. Ali Vardi reached Bardwin with this amall army. Bhas-

Thus diverting the treebooters with the work of picking up
coins, Mahabat Jang seized this respite, and with the ‘celerity
of hghtning and wind riding out at full gallop arrived at Bard-
wau. The hungyy troops, who for three days and nights had
not seen the face of food-stuffs, quenched the fire of their hunger
with the stores of Bardwan. The army of Mahratta freebooters
followed up in pursuit, Sacking villages and towns of the sar-
rounding tracts, and engaging in slaughters and captures, they
set fire to granaries, and spared no vestige of fertility. And
when the stores and granaries of Bardwin were exhausted, and
the supply of imported grains was also completely cut off, to avert
death by starvation, human beings ate plantain-roots, whilst animals
were fed on the leaves of trees. Hven these gradually ceased to
be available. For breakfasts and suppers, nothing except the
discs of the sun and the moon feasted ther eyes. And for nights
and days together, being constantly raounted on their high saddies,
they did noteven dream of sleep. The Afghan and Bhaliah troops
becoming desperate, determined to diehard. Mahabat Jang, seeing
signs of defeat, owing to the exhausted condition of his soldiery,
held a Council of War. It was at last decided to place the artil-
lery round the army, and to put baggages in the centre, and in
this form to march out expeditiously from Bardwan to Katwah,
where food and fodder would be either procurable, or could be im-
ported by waterways or highways from the environs of Murshida-
bad, to relieve the distressed soldiery. In short, in pursuance of

ker Pandit having heard of Ali Vardi’s bravery, proposed to the latter to give
him ten laks of rupees by way of his entertainment expense, in which case
he would return to his own country. Ali Vardi received this suggestion with
disdarm. For some time he was hard-pressed by the Mahrattas, especially
owing tothe defection of is Afghiin officers and troops. Ali Vardi then with
Siraja-d-danleh waited on his Afghan Genersl-in-Chief, Mastafa Khan, told
him to kill him with his grand-son,’ or else to give him his support, in order
to oppose this Mahratta invasion Mustafa Khin, together with other
Afghan officers now fought bravely against heavy odds with the Mahrattas,
and Ali Vadi succeeded in retuing to Katwah, where provisions with a1e-
inforcemené came up under Saulat Jang from Murshidibad. At Katwah,
Mustafa Khan inflicted a severe defeat on Bhaskar Pandit, who now seri-
ously thought gf returning to his own country vid Birbhum; but his chief
adviser, Mir Habib, dissuaded him and brought him back from Birbhum to
Katwih, holdimg ont prospects of loot, and making himself responsible for
the Mabratta, conquest of Bengal.

341

this plan, setting out at night from Bardwin, Mahabat Jang’s
aimy marched towards Katwah, and in a short interval by forced
marches reached Katwah. The light Mahratta cavalry, however,
covered forty ka:0h a day, and thus before Mahabat Jang’s arrival
at Katwah, they had already burnt down its fields, farms, and
gvanaries, and reduced them to ashes. The army of Mahabat
Jang now being in a state of utter despair, sent up to the skies
wails, similar to the following :—

We never get relief from distress ;
To whatever country we roam,
We see the sky alone.

However, Haji Ahmad collecting the bakers of Murghidabad
got breads prepared, and sent these together with other eatables
and food-stuffs on boats to Katwah. Other provisions and food-
grains were also similarly conveyed gradually and in large quanti-
ties. At last, Mahabat Jang’s a:tmy were saved from starvation,
and their cattle also received a grateful supply of fodder and
grass, Mahabat Jang’s soldiers, whose houses were in Murshida-
bad, felt home-sick, and gradually drifted away towards their
homes

As Mir Shaiif, brother of Mir Habib, together with the family
treasures, dependants and children, was at Murshidabad, Mir
Habib with seven hundred Mahratta cavalry swooped down
on Murshidabad, in order to relieve his brother. Marching expe-
ditionsly, night and day, early at day-break, Mir Habib reached
Dihparah and Ganj Muhammad Khan,! to which he set fire. And
opposite to the Citadel, crossing the river Bhagirati, Mir Habib
reached his residence, and taking ont Mir Sharif, together with
his treasures, effects, followers, and dependants, he kept them in

Bajutarah Sar duties, he encamped at Tiratkonah, which was to
the west of the City, at a distance of one farsakk. Haji Ahmad,
Nawazish Ahmad Khan and Husain Quli Khan, who were in the
City, at the very sight of the Mahratta cavalry, firing their guns
once or twice, and closing the avenues to the City as well as the
gates of the Citadel, entrenched themselves, but found it impos-
sible to fight and disperse the enemy, or to defend the City. On
the next day, Mahabat Jang, with his army marching night and
day, entered Marshidabad. Then the Mahrattas abandoned the
idea of assaulting the City, and after desolating the surrounding
tracts acioss the river returned to Katwah. The rainy season
now set in, In view of the tumultuousness of the river, the
Mahrattas now suspended their fighting, established their quar-
ters at Katwih, and from there commenced making administrative
arrangements. Giving Mir Habiba free hand in all affairs, Bhaskar
Pandit himself remained at Katwah, and sent out detachments in
all directions for raid and plunder. Similarly, Mahabat Jang, in
view of giving rest to his army, did not move out of the City.

As in his earlier years, Mir Habib had lived at Hugli, the latter
place still abounded with many of his kinsmen and friends.
Their headman, Mir Abu-l-Hasan Sarkhil, now laid plans to sur-
prise Hugli. He won over many of the Mughals to his side,
and held secret correspondence with Mir Habib. Mir Muhammad
Riza, the Deputy Faujdir of Hugli,! used to treat Mir Abt-l-
Hasan os his right-hand in all affairs.

Mehibat Jang Subadar of Orisea, in place of Abdul Rasul Khan who was
recalled. Dulab Rim had been before Peshkar in Orissa. Duléb Ram exhibited
great cowardice when the Mahrattas invaded Oriesa. The Mehrattas captur-
ed him, and he was released on payment of a heavy ransom after & year.
He was very superstitious, and spent his time mostly in the company of San-
yasis, who turned out to be Mahratta spies. See Seiru-l-Mutakherin, p. 645
(Pers. text).

1 In the Sewru-t-Mutakherin (Pers. text, p. 514) it is stated that Muhammad
Yar Khén, a step-brother of Ali Vardi Khan, was at the time Governor of the
Port of Hugli, and that, Mir Abi-'-Hagsan and Mir Abu-l-Qasim, who were
intimate with the above Governor, congpured with Mir Habib, and induced the
Governor by their treachdrous assnrances to admit Mir Habib into the Fort
of Hugli. After thus treacherously seizing Hngli, Mir Habib installed as its
Governor Sis Rio, a Mabratta, whilst he himself played the réle of the Chief
Adminstrator of Muhratta affairs in Bengal, and divided his residence
between Hugli and Katwah,

In blissful ignorance of the fact that he had a traitor in «his
samp, the Deputy Faujdar passed nights and days in carousals.
At length, at the instigation of Mir Abi-l-Hasan, Mir Habib with
a detachment of two thousand cavalry commanded by Sis Rao
advanced to Hugh, and at midnight arriving at the gate of its
Fort announced his arrival to Mir Abi-l-Hasan. Whilst Muham-
mad Rizé, arranging a feast of revelry, was quite absorbed in
watching the dancing of some pretty women, Mir Abi-1l-Hasay
said to the former: “Mir Habib has come alone to visit you,
and is waiting at the gate of the fort.” Under the influence of
liquor, the Deputy Faujdir unhesitatingly ordered the gate of
the Foit to be thrown open and to admit Mir Habib. BHutering
the Fort, Mir Habib with the concurrence of Mir Abi-]-Hasan
placed Muhammad Riz& and Mirza Piran under surveillance,
established himself inside the Fort, and posted his own guards
at its gate. The noblemen and residents of the town that very
night fled to Qhichrah (Chinsurah) and other places, and took
refuge in the houses of the Dutch and French. Next morn;
ing, Sis Rao with his detachment of cavalry entered the Fort,
Many of the Mughal residents who were Mir Habib’s acquaint-
ances were introduced to Sis Rao by Mir Habib. The Rao treat-
ed them courteously and deferentially, reassured every one of them,
and issning proclamations of peace and security forbade the
Mahrattas from lootimg or sacking the town. He persuaded the
Zamindars to assess and collect the revenue, and appointing 48
usual Qazis, Muhtasrbs and other officers to administer justice,
he bestowed the office of Fanjdar on Mir Abi-l-Hasan, Mir
Habib, carrying off some guns and ammunitions together with a
flotilla of sloops from Hugli, rejoined Bhaskar Pandit at Katwah.

As it was the rainy season, Mir Habib deputed Mir Mihdi
with a detachment of musketeers on boats for collecting revenue
from the mahals across the Ganges. But Mir Mihdi, from fear
of Mahabat Jang, did not land. The agents of the Zamindarg
proceeded to Mir Habib, and paying him large sums obtained
guards for the immunity of their tracts from the ravages and.
loot of Mahratta freebooters. The wealthy nobility and gentry,
to save their family honour, quitted their homes, and migrated
across the Ganges.! The whole tract from Akbarnagar (Rajmahal)

gentry from the weatern side of the Ganges (thatis, from Southern and West-,

to Mednipiar and Jalisér (Jalasore) came into the possession of the
Mahrattas. Those murderous freebooters drowned in the rivers a
large number of the people, after cutting off their ears, noses and
hands. Tying sacks of dirt to the mouths of others, they mangled
and burnt them with indescribable tortures. Tius they desolated
and dishonoured the family and children of a whole world. Maha-
bat Jang, making strenuous efforts towards the chastisement and
expulsion of the insolent enemy, set abont collecting troops and
armaments Requisitioning to Murshidabad a large flotilla of boats
from the neighbourhood of Jahangirnaga: (Dacca), from the Jilengi,
from Maldah, and Akbarnagar (Rajmahal), &e, he constructed a
1oad leading to Katwah. From the eastern bank of the Bhagirati
he detached for bridge-making twelve thousand pioneers and sap-
pera on boats, and attended to the comforts of the army. Collect-

hearts of his soldiery by bestowing on them gifts and increments

pains to account for the comparatively large Musalman population in Eastern
and Northern Bengal and are ready to. put forward more or less fanciful theo-
mes, might perhaps take into consideration the above circumstance, and also
the following facts which I summarise from the Serru-l-Mutadher im (a contem-
porary acconnt) The Ser states that in this wave of Mahratta invasion of
Bengal, the whole of the Chaklahs of Bardwin, Mednipir, Balasore, Katik,
Birbhom, some pargannahs of Rajshahi (probably those on the gouth side of
the river) Akbarongar (Rajymahal) were overwhelmed, whilst only Marghidi.

of the Ganges remained peacefully in possession of Ali Vardi Khin, that m
the rainy season, even the popnlations of Mnarshidabid, apprehending Muh-
ratta raids, migrated en masse on boats to the other sides (that ia, Eastern and
Northern sides) of the Ganges, such as Jahangirnagar or Dacca, Maldah,
Rampore Beaulah, &e , and that ever Nawab Shahamat Jang (Ali Vardi’s son-
melaw) with his family and children moved acroag the river to Godagart, a
place close to Rampore Beauliah, ou the north bank of the Ganges or Poda-
These historical facts occurring aa they did only in the middle of the sight-

portunity, and held a Council of War with his Afghan and Bhaliah
Generals in view of delivering a night-attack. In pursuance of this
plan, Mah&bat Jang marched expeditiously with a large and effi-
cient army, and by forced marches, at midmght, reached a place
just opposite to Katwah. In the cover of the night’s darkness, he
instantly floated a bridge of boats that had been kept rendy from
before, and with a large army commenced crossing the river.
Whilst he with the officers and some veteran soldiers had crossed
the river, the bridge suddenly gave way under the heavy weight
of a large army, Some of the boats sank, whilst a large number
of Afghans and Bhaliahs weie drowned in the river. Mahabat
Jang, on learning about this mishap, was engulphed in a sea of
confusion His mind was racked with anxiety. He realised that the
entire army from the eastern bank of the river had been unable to
cross over, and that he alone with a handfal of troops was on the
western bank face to face with the enemy. In consequence,
he apprehended that in the event of the enemy getting scent
of his movement, he would meet with a terrible disaster. He,
therefore, put out the torches, and gave directions for immediately
repairmg the broken portions of the bridge. After the bridge
was repaired, he ordered the whole army to cross over and
jom him. As the enemy was heedless and negligent, everything
ended well, Kishwar Khan, the Deputy Faujdar, and Mankant,
the commandant of the pioneers and sappers, quickly rendered the
damaged boats water tight by plastermg their cracks and rends
with mud and bits of wood, and thus displayed Lugman-like skill.
An army, waving like the sea, swiftly crossed the bridge, ral-
lied round Mahabat Jang and his Generals, and quickly unsheath-
ing their swords, in a solid and clamorous phalanx, like some hea-
venly disaster, swooped down on the enemy. Shouts rose up on
every side

True, the night was dark, but the sword flashed,

So as amidst the dusky clouds, lightning flashes.
From profuse shedding of blood on that battle-field,
Earth’s face turned crimson.

Heaps of corpses crashed on heaps of corpses,

Aye, formed veritable mounds on every side.

Overwhelmed with disaster, and unnble to stand their ground,

from the battle-field, leaving theu army to their fate, just asa
cow is left to the tender mercies of a butcher. A crushing defeat !
was inflicted on the Mahratta army, which was triumphantly
chased to some distance Bhaskar and other Mahratta Generals
fell back to Ramgadh, from where with common consent they
marched with celerity across jungles, to invade and ravage the
Sibah of Orissa

Shaikh Muhammad Ma‘siim, the Deputy Nazim of Orissa, in
order to resist the enemy, advanced from Katak, and opposed the
enemy's march. When the two armies encountered each other, the
fire of conflict flared up once agun. Although the Zamindars
had deserted lis side, with a small band numbering five thousand
cavalry and infantry, Shaikh Muhammad Ma‘siim stood his ground
dauntlessly on the field. The Mahratta army, which was more
numerous than ants and locusts, surrounded Shaikh Ma‘sim from
all sides like a circle, and slaughtered him together with his
comrades. The Subah of Odisah (Orissa), together with the Fort
of Barabati and the citadel of the O:ty of Katak, fell once again
into the hands of the enemy

Nawab Mahabat Jang, on hearing of the above disaster, march-
ed swiftly to Bardwan. He paid to each soldier two months’ pay
and also other gifts on account of the victory of Katwah, advanc-
ed to Katak, and repeatedly assaulting the Mahratta troops drove
them from Katak, and victoriously entered its citadel, Leaving
General Abdu-r-Rasil Khin, who was a second Mustafa Khan, and

1 This deteat of the Mahrattas at Katwih took place in 1155 A.H. The Sew
ptates that after his defeat at Katwah, Bhaskar Pandit, the Mahratta General,
fled through the Inll-passes of Pachit mto a forest, but losing his way, and
niot succeeding in making his retreat to his own conntry (Nagpur), under the
guidance of Mir Habib, came back to the jungles of Bighanpur, passed through
them to the jungles of Ghandrakonah, emerged at Midnapur, and made for
Katak, fought with and killed Shaikh Ma‘siim, Subadar of Orsesa. Mah&bat
Jang hotly chased Bhiskar Pandit up to the confines of the Chilka Lake, but
Bhaskar sucqeeded in effecting his retreat into the Dakhin. Then Mahabat
Jang returned to Katak, where he installed Abdul Nabi Khan (nephew of
Shaikh Ma‘siim) as Sabidoar of Orissa, and left Dalab Ram (son of Rajah
Janaki Ram) as Peshkar under the latter, and then returned to Murshidabad
(p. 519, Seru-l-Mutakkerwn, Pers, text).

There is a village called Masiimpur abont 11 miles north from Katex.
It is a colony of respectable Muhammadang, and 1s probably named go after
the above Sheikh Ma‘siim Panipat. Six miles from Masimpur, is another
colony of respectable Musalmans at Sahhpur.

who was also the latter’s nephew, as the Deputy Nazim of Orissa,
together with a contingent of six thousand cavalry and infantry,
Mahabat Jang returned to the Sibah of Bengal.

On receiving news of the defeat of Bhaskar Pandit, Sis Rao
evacuating the fort of Hugliretreated to Bishanpir. Other Mah-
ratte, officers, who were posted at different places for the collection
of revenue, also fled. The Collectors and Faujdiisof Mahabat Jang
entered the ravaged tracts, and again set about to re-settle them.

But Bhaskar Pandit, after his defeat, sent Batragi dacoits to-
wards Akbarnagar (Rajmahal), Bhagalpir, and Behar. Mahabat
Jang, who had not yet breathed freely, again set out from Bengal
for those places He had not yet reached the Sibah of Behar,
when the Bairagis retreating from those parts swooped down on
Muighidabid Mahabat Jang fell back from Behar, and pursued
them These Batragi freebooters were busy with looting Balichar,
when the music of the drum and tambourine of Mahabat Jang’s
vanguard rang in the ears of those maniacs. Losing all courage,
aud leaving behind bags of booty, they fled from Balichar. Mahabat
Jang chased them up to Ramgadh, from where he returned.

Tn short, this sort of guerilla warfare lasted three years. Victor-
ies on both sides were mingled with defeats, and 16 was hard to
decide which side eventually came off the best. Nawib Mahabat
Jang, following the saying that “war is made up of fraud,” diplo-
matically established friendly relations with Ali Qarawal, who was
one of the Mahratta leaders that had embraced the Mahammadan
faith, and was surnamed Ali Bhai. From considerations of expe-
diency, Mahébat Jang invited him over. Receiving him kindly
and courteously, using dissimulation and artfulness, and profess-
ing friendship and benignity, he made him consent to arrange an
interview between himself and Bhaskar Pandit with other Mah-
ratta Generals. Heedless of the duplicity of the times, that simple-
ton was taken in, and arrived at Diknagar. He induced Bhaskar
and other Mahratta Generals to meet Mahabat Jang, by conveying
to them the assurances and avowals of Mahabat Jang with refer-
ence to the settlement of the Ohauth and the establishment of
friendly relations. And these, in accordance with the saying ;—
“One perceiveth according to the length! of his sight,” placing

the finger of acceptance on their blind eyes, summoned to their
presence Rajah Janaki Ram and Mustafa Khan for fixing the basis
of a treaty, and for ratifying 16 by protestations and oaths. These
going over to Bhaskar made vows and oaths, according to the forms
of their respective religions and creeds. Mugtafé Khin had with
him, under a cover, a brick instead of the Qoran, and holding it he
repeated oaths. Falling into the trap laid by Mahabat Jang, and
reiterating the vows of peace, Ali Bhai and Bhaskar with other
Mabratta Generals promised to meet Mahabat Jang at a place called
Mankarsh,! and permitted Mustafa Khan and Rajah Janaki Ram
to return. These going to Mahabat Jang assured him of the sac-
cess of their mission, and :elated the mutual promises and vows
that had taken place Expressing his satisfaction, Mahabat Jang
ostensibly set about collecting valuable khillats and jewelleries,
together with elephants, horses, and other rare and precious pre-
sents for presentation to the aforesaid Mahratta Generals. Announc-
ing to the general public news of the approachimg peace, Mahabat
Jang covertly laid a plot of treachery, and took into confidence his
own Generals towards its development. He picked out veteran
and brave soldiers from his army, and caused long and wide tents,
capable of holding large detachments with horses and elephants, to
be pitched at Mankarah. Himself going mto one of the tents, le
arranged a grand party of friends and comrades He secreted in
battle-array inside the tents a battalion of picked men, and sent
a message to Ali Bhai to bring over Bhaskar with all the Mahratta
Generals. In short, Bhaskar, leaving all his troops in camp, came
to Ali Vardi’s tent, together with Ali Bhai and twenty-one other
Mahratta Generals, The tent-pitchers following the signal drop-
ped down the screens of the pavilion, tied them strongly with tent-
ropes, and cut off the ingress and egress of friends and foes,
Mahébat Jang, at the very sight of Bhaskar, said to bis comrades
who were waiting for the signal: “ Kill these heathen sinners.” *
Instantly, swords sprang up fiom every side on the Mahrattas.

1 In Seir (p. 529) Mankara is described as lying on the banke of the shagi-
rati. How the wily Ali Vardi Khan treacherously inveigled Bhaskar Pandit
and other Mahrattia Generals into his tent, is lucidly described in the Sesru-2-
Mutakhervn {p 629). In this game of treachery, Ali Vardi Khin’s principal
coadjators were Mustafa Khan and Rajah Janaki Ram, the Peshkar. It must)
however, be added that the Mahrattas were well paid back in their own coin.

& The expression given in the Seir (p. 580) is: “ Kill this enemy.”

The clamour of assault rose up to the skies,
Breasts were pierced through by swords.

Bhaskar and twenty-one other Mahratta Generals were butcher-
ed. In the midst of this carnage, Mahabat Jang mounting an ele-
phant ordered the music of victory to be siruck up, and ordered _
his select battalion to charge the Mahratta army with their-swords.
On seeing this, one ! of the Mahiatta Generals, who was posted out-
side the pavilion with ten thousand cavalry, fled together with his
force. Mahabat Jang’s soldiers pouncing like fighting lions on
this flock of sheep fiercely attacked the Mahratta troops, and
slaughtered them, right and left, raising human shambles, and
captured those who escaped the sword On hearing of this
disaster, other Mahratta detachments which were encamped at
Bardwan and Diknagar,* &c, or patrolled the tracts between
Medniptir and Akbarnagar (Riymahal) fled to Nigpir.

When news of this disaster reached the ear of Raghoji Bhoslah,

He knitted his brow, from fury of rage,

And coiled, like a serpent, from anxiety of lost treasures.
He kindled such a fire of wrath in his heart, ~

That he scorched himself from head to foot,

After the rainy season was over, Raghoji Bhoslah § mobi-
lised a large force, and marched towards Bengal, to avenge the

hard to inveigle him also into Ali Vardi’s tent, but this Mahratta General ap-

Ali Vardi Khin on the following day, after Bhaskar Pandit and Ali Bhai had
returned from their interview with Ali Vardi

8 The Sewu-l-Mutakherin (Pers text, pp 545-548) gives a very lucid account
of this second Muhratta mvasion of Bengal by Raghoji Bhoslah It appears
that important affairs transpired in the meantime in the Bengal Satrapy,
which made for thia second Mahbratta invasion In the fitst place, Mustafi
Khan, the Afghin General-in-Chief and the chief pillar of the State of Ali
Vardi Khan, fell out with the latter, and was locked up in fighting against
Ali Vardi’s son-in-law, Zain-d-din Khan, Subidar of Azimabad(Patna) Whilst
hardpressed by the well-formed battalions of Zain-d-din Khan, Mostafa Khin,
like Mir Habib, took the unusual step to invite over to Bengal Raghojt
Bhoslah, who seized the invitation with avidity and marched with Mir Habib
(the implacable foe of Ali Vardi and the inspiring genius of the Mahrattas),
towards Katak, At this time at Katak, a cowardly person ruled as Ali

slaughter of Bhaskar and other Mahratta Generals, and engaging
on massacres, captures, and plunders, tortured, many of his cap-

Vardi’s Subidar in Orissa. His name was Dulab Ram, and he was a gon
of Rajah Janoki Ram, Ali Vardi’s Peshkar. Ali Vardi had appomted Dulab
Ram as Subiadar, in the place of Abdul Rasul Khan (son of Abdul Nabi
Khan) who had resigned his office-and joined Mugjafa at Patna. Dulab Ram
was not only cowardly, but superstitious, and most probably, also treacher-
ous (as his subsequent conduct towards Ali Vardi’s grandson indicates). He
associated at Katak with the Sanyasis, most of whom were spies in the employ
of Raghoji Bhosiah. As soon as Dalab Ram heard of the appronch of the
Mahrattas, he attempted to run away, but was soon after captured by the
Mahrattas, At the time, a small band of Syeds, under the command of Mir
Abdul Aziz, bravely held out for over a month sn the Fort of Barabati. The
heroic stand against heavy odds made by this small beleaguered garrison
and its unflinching loyalty, once more relieves the darkness of the moral
chaos that had seized the times. When cajoled and threatened by Raghoyji
Bhoslah’s friend, Mir Habib, and entreated by Dulab Ram and by his own
brother to join Raghoji’s side, Mir Abdul Aziz returned the following gallant
and loyel answer: ‘I own no brother nor any other master; I acknow-
ledge only one master, namely, Mahibat Jang; trae, some cowards have
joined you; but from regard for the salt I have eaten, I will, by God, stand
by this Fort, so long as there is breath in my life.” (Ser, p. 546). As how-
ever, no reinforcements came up, though over a month had elapsed, and
as all provisions had run out, this noble band of beleaguered garrison had
at length to capitulate on honourable terms to Raghoji Bhoslah, who made
himself master of the Fort Barabati and also of the whole of Orissa pro-
vince, as well as of Mednipir, Haghli and Bardwan. Ali Vardi was occupied
ab this time in Patna in ornshing out the Afghan revolt under Mustafa
Khan. When Mustafa Khin was slam and the Afghin revolt was orush-
ed, Ali Vardi hastened back to Bengal. At this time, Raghoji was encamped
at Birbhom. Meanwhile the Afghin comrades of the late Mustafa Khin, who
lay in a death-trap in the Jungles of Tikari asked Raghoji to help them,
and promised him their adhesion. Raghoj: marched to Tikari to their resone
vid the jungles of Birbhnm and Kharakpar, looting en route the villages of
Shaikpua and Tikari, &o. Mnhaibat Jang followed quickly in their heels and
moved to Patna. From Patna, Raghoyi (on the advice of Mir Habib, who was
the inspirmg genius of the Mahrattas, aleo in this second Marhatta invasion)
turned towards Murghidaibad, pureued closely by Ali Vardi, whose pursuit
was hot and unslacking. At Katwih, another battle was fought, in which
the Mahrattas were worsted. Finding that viotory was out of the question,
and hearing of some tronbles in his own country, Raghoji now pradently
withdrew to his own couniry ab Nagpur, leaving in Bengal his friend, guide,
and philosopher, Mir Habib, with 3,000 Mabratta and 7,000 Afghan troops.
(See Serru-l-Mutakkerm, Pers. text, p. 551). It would seem a despicable mo-
rpl chaos hed at this time seiged the oduntry, in which neither religious ties

tives. Ali Vardi Khan with a large army again advanced to en-
counter the enemy. At this juncture, Balaji Rao, ! son of Baji
Rao Pandit, Peshwa and generalissimo of Rajah Sahi, who was
young, and had enmity with Raghoji, under orders of Emperor
Muhammad Shah, came from the Imperial Capital (Dihli) to Ben-
gal with sixty thousand Mahratta cavalry, to re-inforce Ali Vardi
Khan. Mahabat Jang, finding floods of disaster approaching Bengal
from two sides, shewed firmness and foresight. He deputed ex.
perienced envoys with presents vo Balaji Rao, won him over to his
side by display of courtesy and sincerity, met him at Birbhim, estab-
lished friendly relations with him, and both unitedly resolved to
drive out Raghoji Bhoslah. Raghoji findmg it impracticable to
accomplish the object of his mission withdrew to his own country,
without gaining bis end. Being somewhat relieved of his anxiety
by the withdrawal of Raghoji Bhoslah, Mahabat Jang presented
large amount of cash to Balaji Rao, and thus sent him out of Ben-
galin a contented and thankful mood, whilst he himself returned
to Bengal. Being inwardly in anxiety as to the demand of Rag-
hoji for Ohauth, Mahabat Jang set about mobilising troops.

At this moment. a. rupture occurred between Ali Vardi Khan and

nor national sentiments were held of any account. One finds now Musalmad
Afghans (at the instigation of two Musalman leaders, Mir Habib and Mus-
tafa Khan), fighting the battles of Hindu Mahratta freebooters against a
Musalman power in Bengal. The event is & dark land-mark in Moslem history
of Bengal, and marks the sad disintegration and moral paralysis that had now
seized the Musalman race in Bengal or, for the matter of that, in India. (See
Seir, Pers. text, pp. 556-566).

‘ Balaji Rao (the generalissimo of the Imperial Army in the Dakhin)
and Safdar Jang, son-m-law of Burhanu-l-Mulk, the Subadar of Ondh, were
orderd by Emperor Muhammad Shah, to help Ali Vardiagainst the Mahrattas
under Raghoji. Whilst seeking Imperial assistance, Ali Vardi wrote the
following pregnant and prophetic words to the Hmperor :—‘ Should Bengal
which is the financial mainstay of the Empire fall, your Majesty's Empire
will be shorn of all lustre.’ (See Sew, p. 516, Pers. text), These words had
reference to the fact that Bengal had ever been the best milch-cow of the Em-
pire. Safdar Jang did not pall on with Ali Vardi, and so was recalled by the
Hmperor, whilst Balaji Bao (whose designs were also suspected by the
shrowd Ali Vardi) who had come to Mankar by way of Patna, was courte-
ously shewn out of Bengal by the latter. (See Seir, pp 622 and 524). In
this connection, the Seir (p. 524) gives the story of a Musalman amazon in
the person of the widow of the late Mohammad Ghang Khan who resided
at Bhagulpur, and who held out avely against Balaji Rao,

Mustafa Khan, the Afghan General, and it was so far accentuated
that all the Afghins combining with the latter, broke out into
revolt, and set out with » large force for Azima&bad (Patna), in order
to storm that City, and to capture Haji Ahmad and Zainu-d-din
Ahmad Khan. On reaching Mungir (Monghyr), Mustafa Khan be-
sieged the Fort of Monghyr. ~The Commandant of the Fort pre-
pared to fight. Abdu-r-rasil Khan, !a consin of Mustafa Khan, ad-
vancing in the inebriation of the wine of valour and daring, wanted
to storm the Fort, by battering down its gate. The guards of the
Fort hurled down a huge stone on his head, From the blow of
that heavy stone, his head was smashed to atoms. Mustafa Khan,
viewing this disaster to be a bad omen, abandoned the siege of
Monghyr, marched with celerity to Azimabad, (Patna), engaged in
besieging the latter City, and commenced fighting with Zainn-d-
din Ahmad Khan. Most of the detachments of Zainu-d-din Khan,
not being able to stand their ground in the face of the onslaughis
of the Afghans, retreated to the citadel, but Zainu-d-din Khan
himeelf with a small squadron of cavalry, artillery, and Bhalich
musketeers remained out in the open to encounter the enemy.
At this moment, the Afghans fell to plundering and pillaging
the tents of Zainu-d-din’s troops who had retreated. Seeing
Mastafa Khan now left with a small force, Zainn-d-din Ahmad
Khan formed a van-guard of artillerymen and Bhaliah musketeers,
and commenced an assault.* The shells of guns and bullets of
muskets now commenced showering like hail. Most of Mustafa
Khan’s comrades tasted the bitter potion of death; whilst one
bullet, hitting Mustafa Khan on the socket, blinded one of his
eyes. Then Zainu-d-din’s other troops who had retreated to the
citadel also rushed out, attacked the Afghans, and put them to
the sword. Mugtafa Khan on being defeated retreated to Jag-
dishpir.’ Becoming victorious and triamphant, Zainu-d-din Khan
struck up the band of victory, made his State entry into the
Fort, and next engaged on chasing the enemy. Mustafa Khan
now sent a message to Raghoji Bhoslah,* and asked for help.

Raghoji, who was waiting for such an opportunity, was delight-
ed, and prepared to despatch reinforcements. But Mahabat
Jang, on being apprised of this news, swiftly marched to Azi-
mabad (Patnay The Bengaland Azim&bad (Patna) armies form-
ing a junction combined to attack Mustafa Khin. After much
fighting, Mustafa Khan, finding 1t impossible to hold his own,
retreated in a hapless condition across the frontier of Azimabad to
Ghizipir; whilst Mahabat Jang becoming victorious and trium-
phant returned to Murshidabad. Mustafa Khan again collected
s large force of cavalry and infantry, and again invaded Azimabad.
Zainu-d-din Ahmad Khan, according to the adage “One who is
beaten once can be beaten twice,” with his victorious troops
encountered him, and after much efforts and countless exertions,
and after much slanghters and fightings, became victorious, whilst
Mustafa Khan, as a retribution for his disloyalty, was slain on the
battle-field. Zainu-d-din Khan cutting off the head of that wretch
from his body tied his corpse to the feet of an elephant which
was patrolled round the city to serve as a warning, and also
suspended his head at the City Gate.

At this juncture, Raghoji Bhoslah despatched to Bengal a Mah-
ratta army under the command of his son Rajah Janoji, his adopted
son, Mohan Singh, and the miscreant Mir Habib, in order to de-
mand the Chauth.! A large number of Mustafa Khin’s Afghan ad-

of Rajah ‘Gajpate’ or ‘ Kachite,’ who was the greatest Zamindar in Behar at
the time.” Inthe 16th year of Akbar’s reign, Akbar’s General, Shahbaz Khan-
i-Kambu, operated against this Rajah who fled, and Shahbaz then conquered
Jagdispir, when the whole family of the Rajah was captured. Shahbaz then
conquered Shergadh, which was held by Sri Ram, Gajpati’s son, and about the
same time took possession of Rohias.

1 This third Mahratta invasion of Bengal under Janoji, sou of Raghoji
Bhoslah (with him being of course the mevitable Mir Habib as the Chief Ad-
viser and as guide, friend and philosopher of the Mahratitas), 1s also lucidly
narrated in the Sésru-l Mutakherw (Pers. text, pp. 555-592). Janoji came to
Katak, whilst Ali Vardi’s newly-nominated Deputy Subadar of Orissa, Mir
Jafur, was still at Mednipiir, on his way to Katak. On hearing of the Mah-
xatta incursion, Mir Jafar (who secretly was conspiring against Ali Vardi)
retired to Bardwan. Tho Mabrattas then advanced to Bardwan. After some
indecisive skirmishing, Janoji made for Murghidabad, and after doing
some looting in its neighbourhood retreated to Meduipiir, pursued by Ali Vardi
Khin, in the meantime, Janoji’s principal adviser, Mir Habib, had opened
treacherous negotiations with the late Mustefi Khin’s Afghan adherents

herenta alsq joined them, and the market of fight and slaughter once
again became way'm in the conflict between Mahabat Jang and the
Marhattas The Sitbah of Orissa fell into the hands of Janoji,
whilst weakness set in in the Province of Bengal. Mir Habib open-
ed negotiations for the settlement of the Chauth of Bengal. Nawé-
zsh Ahmad Khan, Absan Quli Khan, ! Jagat Set, and the Rai-
Raidn * exerted themselves strenuously on the side of peace. But

in Darbhanga and 1ts neighbourhood, and these had effected a sanguinary
revolution by treacheronsly killmg at @ Darbar Zamu-d-din Khan, Subadir of
Patna. Now Janoji moved to Patna (with him bemg Mir Habib), and Ali Vardi
also proceeded to Patna. Ali Vardi now rose to the height of his generalship,
and succeeded in croshing and routing his umted Afghan and Marhatta foes
in @ great battle uear Barh. (See the spimted desorption of this battle in
the Sew, p. 664) Janoji, now receiving news of his mother's death, retreat-
ed to Nagpiir, leaving Mir Habib towards Katak and Mednipir with some
Mabratta and Afghan troops (Ser, p- 576). Shoitly after, Raghoyi sent to
Mir Habib another Mahratta remforcement under Manaji, younger brother of
Janoji [Mohan Singh of the text is obviously a mistake or misprint for Manaj1]
Ali Vardi marched out with his army from Murshidibad and passed through
Katwah, Bardwan, Medmpir, Bhadrak, and Jajpor , whilst Mir Habib with
ins Mahratta and Afghan troops fell back from Mednipir towards Katak. Ali
Vardi trismphantly entered once more the City of Katak, and recaptured the
Fort of Barabati, after killing its commandants, Serandaz Khin, Syed Nur,
and Dharam Dass (p 578, Seir)}, Pers text This re-conquest, however, proved
abortive, for whilst Ali Vardi was still at Balasore on his way towards Mur-
shidabid, Mir Habib with his light Mahratta and Afghan cavalry swooped
down on Katak, and killed Shaikh Abdus Subhan, who had been left there as
Deputy Governor by Ali Vardi (See pp. 579-580 of the Seer, which also gives
a good description of the Katak City). The Mahrattas, 1b would seem, always
moved with light and mobile cavalry, whilst Ali Vardi’s army was not equally
light or mobile. Ali Vardi had, therefore (despite the fact that next to
Asafjah, he was the first General of the time im India) to encounter the
same difficulties in encountering Mahratta troops, that the British had in en-
countering the Boers in the late South Afmcan War. In the end, it is true,
Ali Vardi tmumphed, but the price that he had to pay for his apparent victory
was too much, nor did he survive it long enough to reap its benefit

1 In a former part of the text, he is named “ Husain Quli Khan,” which
appears to be correct (See Ser, Vol. II, Pers text, p. 495). Husain Quli
Khan was Naib or Deputy of Nawazish Mubammad Khan, son-in-law of Ali
Vardi Khan, and Governor of Chakla Jahangirnagar (Dacca), including Silhat
and Ohittagong.

Mahabat Jang, considering the acceptance of Chauth to be hu-
miliating, refused to conclude peace, and with his army prepared
to fight and drive out the Mahrattas. Mahabat Jang suspected
treachery from Sham Sher Khan, Sardar Khan, Murad Sher Khan,
Haat Khan, and other Afghan Generals of Darbhanga, who, during
the late msurrection, had sided with Mustafa Khan. And, as a
matter of fact, these Afghan Generals had opened at this time
treasonable correspondence with Mir Habib aud his Mahrattas.
These Afghan Generals, following the example of Mustafa Khan,
now broke out into open revolt on the pretext of demand of
pay. Mahabat Jang, having lost all confidence i them, paid
them up, and disbanded them These reaching Darbhanga, after
a short time, learned amongst themselves in pursuance of designs
of treachery, and made offers of service to Zaimu-d-din Ahmad
Khan As Zamu-d-din Khan was a friend of soldiers, he con-
ciliated them, accepted their offers of service with the approval of
Nawab Mahabat Jang, and mvited them toa Darbar. Sham Sher
Khan and Murad Sher Khan with a corps of Afghans arrived at
Hajipir, and encamped on the banks of the mver. According to
the order of Zainu-d-din Ahmad Khan, they left behind all their sol-
diers, and crossing the river came to Azimabad (Patna) attended
only by three hundred cavalry, consisting of kinsmen and comrades
who were all of one heart for the purpose of waiting on Zainu-
d-din Ahmad Khan. On obtaining an audience, they observed all
the points of etiquette, and sat in the Qhihil satin Palace, ranged
on the mght and left of Zainu-d-din. Zainu-d-din Ahmad Khan
reclining agamst pillows on a Masnad, made polite enquiries regard-
ing each. Murad Sher Khan, nephew of Sham Sher Khan, finding
Zainu-d-din off his guard, pulled out a dagger from his waist, hit the
latter so hard with it on the stomach, that his intestines came out.
By that single blow, Zamu-d-din was killed! The traitors, lifting

1 It would appear from the account given inthe Sesru-l-Mutakharin (p 566),
alluded to before, that the Afghan adherents of the late Mustafi Khin were
in secret conspiracy with Mir Habib, the inspming genius, and the guide, friend
and philosopher of the Mahrattas, and that m consequence of Mir Habib’s
instigation, they had enacted this cruel tragedy at Patna.

treasures and effects, captured the Begam! with her daughter and
also Haji Ahmad. They suspended the Haji? to a tripod with his
head downwards, and by torturing him made him give up large
treasures, aud slew him. They carried off the ladies of the Harem
together with numerous treasures as booty And similarly, they
swept the houses of other nobles of the City with the broom of
rapine. These Rohilah Afghans sacked the City and its suburbs,
looted treasures, dishonoured women and children, and desolated a
whole world.’ <A great consternation seized those regions. ‘‘ Pro-
tect me, O Lord, from the wickedness of infidels and from the
wrath of Thine.” Sham Sher Khan collecting one hundred thou-
sand cavalry and infantry was not contented with the subjuga-
tion of Azimabad, and he further cherished visions of conquering
Bengal. Mahabat Jang, who was at this time encamped at Amé-

Darbar function was nearly over, and Zainu-d-din Khin was handing betels
with his own hand to the Chief Afghan Generals, when one of these, Abdur
Rashid Khan, whilst receiving a betel, treacherously gave Zainu-d-din Khin a
dagger-thrust im the abdomen. This thrast, however, was not quite effective, as
Abdayr Raghid’s hand faltered Then another cowardly assassin, Marad Sher

Happening as 1b did towards the ‘middle of the 18th century, this fact
would explain in a great measure the smallness of Musalman population in
Behar, compared with that in Northern Bengal and Eastern Bengal, which in
modern times weie never or seldom the scenes of such carnage, which were
immune from Mahratta raida, and which wonld, therefore, naturally afford su
asylum for Musalman refugees not only from the distarhed parts of Western
and Southern Bengal, but also from Behar.

freebooters, suddenly received the terrible intelligence of the
slaughter of Zainu-d-din Ahmad Khan and Haji Ahmad, and of
the hostile advance of the Afghans. In consequence, an in describ-
able agony seized him, and his family and kindred. From exces-
sive depression and agony, he wanted to isolate himself from all in-
tercourse with the world, and to abandon the City with its Bazar
to the Mahratta freebooters. His generals employing various
consolations and assurances recited passages inculcating fortitude,
and tied the girdle of courage in pursuit of revenge in the waist of
their hearts. But when for accomplishing this avenging mission,
they applied for the payment of the soldiers, Mahabat Jang plead-
ed he hadnomoney. Then Nawazish Muhammad Khan Shahamat
Jang, standing surety for the expenses of the soldiery, paid to the
soldiers eighty Jaks of rupees in cash from his own treasury, and
made them agree to undertake the avenging expedition. Mahi-
bat Jang, being somewhat now relieved from anxiety, left Nawa-
zish Muhammad Khan Shahamat Jang at Murghidabad, and him-
self marched to Azimabid with a large army.! Mir Habib, at
the instigation of Sham Sher Khan, with hordes of Mahratta free.
booters, pursued Mahabat Jang from the rear, tracking jungles
and setting fire, right and left, to the villages, with their grana-
ries. Mir Habib looted Mahabat Jang’s baggages and tents, and
did not allow Mahabat Jang’s army a breathing interval either for
sleep or for food, nor suffered a single day to pass without skir-

to march out against the Mahrattas under Mir Habib and Janoji. There in
camp, Ali Vardi received this terrible news of the slaughter of his son-in-law,
and of the imprisonment of his brother and daughter and grand-children.
He summoned his officers to a Darbar, and broke to them the news of the
great calamity in the following solemn strain :—“ Gentlemen, a stone has fal-
len on me, and that, too, a heavy one; my son-in-law hes been killed, and my
brother and children are in the disgrace of capture, Life is now a trash to
me; I have resolved to kill and to be killed. What is your intention, gentle-
men ? Who amongst you, my comrades and friends, shall jon me in my aveng-
ing expeditionP® All who were present cheerfully responded to AIT Vardi
Khin’s appeal, and resolved to fight and fall with him.

1 The account in the Ser (p. 565), shows that Mir Habib with his Mahratia
friends opposed ineffectnally Ali Vardi’s march on the banks of the Ohampana-
gar stream, and then dispersed to the jungles, whilet Alt Vardi moved on to
the Monghyr Fort, where he halted seme days Then Rajah Sundar Singh,

mishes with swords and spears, till they passed beyond Barh. At
Baikantpir! an engagement took place with the army of Sham
Sher Khan. Rajah Sundar Singh, Zamindar of Tikari, with a
powerful corps, joined Ali Vardi And when on both sides, the
fire of slanghter flared up, the army of Mahratta freebooters, who,
like the shadow, always followed Mahabat Jang’s army, attacked
its rear. Afghan troops from front and Mahratta freebooters
from the vear attacked and hemmed in the army of Mahabat
Jang. The heroes of Maha&bat Jang’s army, perceiving the
approaching inrush of cqlamity towards them from both sides,
prepared to die hard, and fonght desperately. In that victory
hes with God, by a stroke of good luck, Sham Sher Khan, Sardar
Khan, Murad Sher Khan, and other Afghan Generals were
hit by bullets of guns, in retribution for their disloyalty, and
were killed, whilst other Afghan troops cowardly fed. The sol-
diers of Mahibat Jang, by brave onslaughts, routed the enemy's
army, charging them with swords, spears, arrows, muskets and
rockets, killed those wretches, and raised hecatombs of the
slain, The Mahratta army, on seeing Ali Vardi’s glorious vio-
tory, retreated, and dispersed like the constellation of the bear.
Mahabat Jang after prostrating himself in thanksgiving to God,
triumphantly entered Azimabid, and rescuing the family and
children of Zainu-d-din AhmadKhan and H&ji Ahmad fiom the
rack of those outragers of honour, captured the wives and daughters
of those treacherous wretches.

What need is there for anyone to seek for retaliation P

1 The Seir (p. 567), which gives a very lucid account of this battle, states
that Ali Vardi who in generalship was next only to Asaf Jah, took up a posi-
tion on an isle, in front of Barh, having on ove side the rver Ganges and on
another the old bed of the same river. ‘This place is called in the Seir “ Sarai
Rani,” 4 kroh to the west of Barh, on the side of the river Ganges.

It would also appear from the Seir (p. 566), that Mir Habib and the Mah-
rattas held a conference with the Afghen rebels, Sham Sher Khan and Sardar
Khan, in order to concert measures for attacking Ali Vardi Khin. The
Afghans and Mabrattas under Mir Habib now mado @ common cause against
Ali Vardi who, however, crashingly ‘defeated both, owing to his superior
generalship (See Sev p. 568),

& It reflects credit on Ali Vardi that he treated honourably the women
and children of Sham Sher Khin and other Afghans. He not only generously

ling expenses to the Afghan ladies, and allowed them to daphxt
hononrably to Darbhanga, and followed the adage “Turn Evil by
Good.” Appointing Siréju-d-daulah, son of Zainu-d-din Ahmad
Khan, to be Sibadar of Azimabad, in succession to hs father,
and leaving Rajah Janaki Ram as Siraju-d-daulah’s Deputy there,
and finishing the administrative arrangements of that Sibah,
Mahabat Jang returned to Bengal, in order to drive out the
Mahratta freebooters.

About this time, the office of Faujdar of the tract of Purniah
was vacant, owing to the flight to the Imperial Capital of the,
Khan Babadur,! son of Nawab Saif Khan. Ali Vardi Khin éon-
ferred the above Faujdarship on Said Ahmad Khan Saulat Jang,
in whose heart ambition for the Nizémat of Bengal lurked, and in
whose head visions of ruling over Bengal existed. At the time
when Mahabat Jang was engaged in fighting with Sham Sher
Khan, Sidju-d-daulah shewed his temper to Nawab Izazu-d-
daulah Atia I-lah Khan Sabit Jang, a son-in-law of Haji Abmad,
who held the office of Faujdar of Akbarnagar (Rajmahal). Know-
ing Atau-l-lah Khan * to be brave and popular with the army, and
ambitious and sound-headed, Siraju-d-daulah set to work his ruin,
and plymg Ali Vardi Khan with his suspicions gained over the
latter, and induced him to send a message to Atau-l-lah to quit the
country, or else to prepare for death. The aforesaid Khan, after

forgave them, and set them at liberty, but bestowed properties at Darbhing’
for their maintenance. (See p. 570, Ser). He never addressed the Afghan ladies
except a3 ‘Madams’ or ‘Bibis.’ He studiously maintained the sanctity of their
seclusion, and this, too, after the gross provocation he had received at the
hands of Sham Sher Khan and other Afghans, Ali Vardi’s chivalry towards
women seems to have been remarkable, and his forbearance after victory 18
alsocommendable A vaulting ambition thet faltered not to break all ties
of gratitude, nor scrapled to use all weapons of treachery in the realwation
of that ambition—casts a dark and sombre hue on his otherwise great and
remarkable personality.

1 His name was Fakhru-d-din Husain Khan. He succeeded his father,
Nawab Saif Khan, in the Fanjdirship of Purniah. Ali Vardi Khin got him
dismissed, and kept him ander surveillance for some time ati Murshdibad.
Through the help of Mir Habib and his Mehrattas, akhru-d-din managed to
make good his escape to Dell, where he died after a short time. (See Serr,

perial Capital, remained in the company of Nawab Vaziru-l-mulk
Safdar Jang,! and then joining Rajah Nul Rai *in the Rohilla
Afghan war was killed at Farrukhabad.

As in consequence of the insurrection at Azimabad, the Mah-
yatta, freebooters had taken possession of the Siibah of Orissa,
Mahabat Jang, not halting in Bengal, set out for that Sibah. " Bx.
pelling the Mahratta freebooters from that Sibah, Mah&bat Jang
put to death Syéd Nar, Sarindaz Khan, and other officers, who were
adherents of the Mahratta freebootars, and who were entrenched
in the fort of Barahbati, by drawing them out of their entrenched
position by use of diplomatic assurances. And capturing the
horses and armaments of their comrades, and expelling them all
from Katak, Mahabat Jang returned to Bengal.

As Mir Habib was the root of all the mischiefs and troubles,
Mahabat Jang hatched a plan for lis destruction He sent to bis
name a letter, purporting falsely to be a reply to his message, to the
following effect: ‘The letter sent by you has been received , what
you have written in respect of your plan to extirpate the Mah-
ratta freebooters, has met with my approval. 1 isa very good
idea: you from that side, and I from this side, will be on the alert
and wait, By every means possible, try and induce them to come
this side, and then what is now 'm the minds of us both will come
to pass.” Mahabat Jang sent this message through a courier, in-

Shih, and in the reign of Emperor Almad Shah became Chief Vizier of the
Bmpire, on the death of Qamru-d-din Khan. At this time, Ahmad Shah

and Moradabad became a power in the land. Safdar Jang appointed as his
Deputy in Onde a Kyet, named Biyah Nul Ra, (See Sewru-l-Mutekhersn, Vol.

structing the latter to proceed by such route, that he might be
intercepted by the Mahrattas and the letter might fall into their
hands. This ruse proved a complete success, and the Mahratias
suspecting Mir Habib slew him.!

‘Yo sum up, for twelve long years the fires of war and slaughter
kindled between the Mahratias and Mahabat Jang, and the Mah-

that after a treaty of peace was concluded between Mahibat Jang and
the Mahrattas, Mir Habib ruled over Orissa as Governor, on behalf of
Mahibat Jang, whilst a Mahratia contmgent of troops under a Mahratta
officer was stationed at Katak Mir Habib was succeeded in the office of
Governor by Masliha-d-din Muhammad Khan, who, however, enjoyed less
prestige, and regarded himself as a servant of the Mabrattas (Ser, p. 693,

Sew. From Sewr’s account (p 592), 16 would appear Mir Habib was the first

the conclusion of the peace. The details of this treaty of peace in 1165 A H

now 75 years old, and physical ailment and infirmity had seized him, and ag
the war between hin and Mahrattas had been protracted to ten years, and as
the chief Afghan pillars of his State had revolted against him, and as the peo-
ple had suffered indescribable miseries du.ing this long struggle, Mahabat Jang
accepted the overtures of peace, which was concluded through the mterven-
tion of Mirza Salh (on behalf of Mir Habib and the Mahrattas) and Mir
Jafar (on behalf of Mahibat Jang). The terms of peace were: (1). Mir
Habib becoming a servant of Mahabat Jang should on behalf of the latter
rule as Deputy Governor over Orissa (2). The revenue of Oriase should be
assigned by Mir Habib for the pay of Raghoji Bhosla’s Mahratta army of
occupation. (3). ‘hat over and above the revenues of Orissa, twelve luks of
rupees should be annually paid by Mir Habib to Raghoyi Bhoslah (presumably
from the revenues of other provinces), on condition that Raghoy’s troops should
not raid the dominions of Mahabat Jang. (4) The mver Sunamukhia (or
Subarnarikha) near Jalisar (Jalasore), was to form the demarcation-line of the
boundaries of Orissa and Bengal ; Mednipir at this time being separated fiom
Onaga and annexed to Bengal.

. | The author of the Sew (who was a connexion of Mahibat Jang) praises
up the memory of Mahabat Jang (See Sew, Vol II, pp 609-611). He states
that Mahabat Jang abstained from pleasures, was regular in his prayers,
abstemious in habits, and methodic in business. He slept hitle, and passed
most of his time in attending to State affairs, or in the company of scholars
and savants whom he held in high esteem. Ue had only one wife, to whom
he was greatly devoted. He was a splendid general and a far-sghted
statesman. When Musfafi Khan, his Afghan General, and his relatives,
Shshamat Jang and Sanlat Jang used to press Mahibat Jang to fight and
drive out the Enghsh from Calcutta, Mahabat Jang used toreply “ Mustafa
Khan is amihtary man, and therefore he 1s always eager for war, that I may
be constantly in need of bis services. What evil have the Hnglish done to
me, that I should wish evil to them? The (Mahratta) fire on land 1s not yet
extinguished; and if the fire is extended to the sea, who will quench 1b?”
(Serr, p. 611, Vol II, Pers. text). Despite the Sew’s panegyric, 1+ seems to me
that Ali Vardi mast forfeit his claim to be regarded aa a far-sighted statesman,
in view of the fact that his treacherous and violent couduct towards his past

NIZAMAT OF NAWAB SIRAJU-D-DAULAH.

When Nawab Ali Vardi Khan Mahabat Jang passed to the re-
gions of eternity, Naw&b Siraiju-d-daulah, son of Zainu-d-din
Ahmad Khan Haibat Jang, and maternal grandson of Ali Vardi,
who from before had been declared heir-apparent by Ali Vardi
Khan, and whom Ali Vardi Khan had in his life-time placed on
the cushion of the Nizimat, and to whom Ali Vardi with all the
grandees of the court had paid homage and offered presents—as-
cended the masnad of the rulership over Bengal, Behar, and Orissa
Siriju-d-daulah exhibited insolence and arrogance, which are the
worst of attributes, and are displeasing to God. At that time,
owmg to certain reasons, Ghasiti Begam, widow of Nawazish
Abmad Khan Shahamat Jang, who resided at Mutijhil, resolving
to oppose Siraju-d-daulah, appomnted Mir Nazar Ali, who was her
servant and was bound to her by ties of various favours and obli-
gations, to be the commander of her vanguard, and Nawab Bairém
Khan to be generalissimo of her army. Then the Bégam of
Mahabat Jang, and Jagat Set, as an emissary of Siraju-d-daulah,
went to Ghasiti Begam and gave her assurances ; and so the latter
refrained from hostility, whilst Nazar Ali fled, and Bairam Khan
taking refuge with one of the generals fell into disgrace. Siraju-
d-daulah’s army arriving captured Ghasiti Begam, together with
all her effects. The Begam saw what she had never seen, and heard
what she had never heard. Siraju-d-daulah’s army rased to the
ground her buildings and her palace, and unearthing her buried
treasures carried them to Mansirganj. Owmg to Siradju-d-dau-
lah’s harshness of temper and indulgence in violent language,
fear and terror had settled on the hearts of everyone to such an
extent, that no one amongst the generals of the army or the
noblemen of the City was free from anxiety. Amongst his officers,
whoever went to wait on Siréju-d-daulah despaired of life and
honour, and whoever returned without bemg disgraced and ill-
treated offered thanks to God. Surfju-d-daulah treated all the
noblemen and generals of Mahabat Jang with ridicule and drollery,
and bestowed on each some contemptuous nick-name that ill-suited
any of them.! And whatever harsh expressions and abusive

letters which added give 1170! (the date of Siriju-d-daulah’s murder by Mir
Jafar and bis son Miran). The Ibsat seems to have been written by some
adherent of Nawab Sarfaraz Khan.

epithets came to his lips, Siraju-d-daulah uttered them unhesita-
tingly in the face of everyone, and no one had the boldness to
breathe freely in his presence. Appointing a Kyeth, named Mo-
hanlal, to be the minister and controller of all affairs, Sicdju-d-
daulah bestowed on him the title of Maharajah Mohanlal! Baha-
dur, gave him a large bodyguard of cavalry and infantry, and
ordered all his generals and nobles to pay respect to him. All did
so, except Mir Muhammad Jafar Khan, a brother-in-law of Nawab
Mahabat Jang, and the generalissimo of the army, who refused to
pay respect to Mohanlal, and for some time ceased to pay respect
even to Siraju-d-daulah. But. Rajah Mohanlal, coiling himself
round the brain and skin of Siraju-d-daulah, forgot himself so far
that he fancied nobody else existed, appointed his own kith and
kin to posts connected with the Crown-Domains and also to other
revenue offices, and dismissed the old officers. For instance, Rajah
Mohanlal sent a message to Nawab Ghulém Husain Khan Baha-
dur ® that if he accepted a pay of Rs. 200 a month, he might
stay on, otherwise he should quit the country. The latter,
of necessity, on the plea of visiting the Kabah, set out for
Higli.

Inasmuch as before Mahabat Jang’s death, in the beginning of
that year, on the 18th of Rabiu-l-Awal, Nawab Nawazigh Ahm~
mad Khan Shahaimat Jang, who held the office of Diwan of Ben-

pointed a Kyeth named Mobanlal as his Supreme Diwan This elevation of
an obscure Hindu to the highest orvil appointment naturally cansed great
offence to the old nobility, and especially to Mir Jafar, who conspired with
other officers of the late Mahabat Jang in order to bring about a Revolution
to deatroy Sirijn-d-daulah’s power, and to place himself on the masnad of
Bengal.

1 The Seir, the Ibiat-1-Arbab-1-Bagr, and the Riyaz all condemn Sirgju-d-
daulah for appointing this obscure and insolent Hindu, Mohanlal, as his Sup-
reme Minister, and mention the disgust it cansed amongst the old nobility,
who chafed under this indignity, and were therefore anxious to throw off
Sirdju-d-danleh’s yoke. (See Ibrat-s-Arbab-1-Basr, p. 26, Betru-i-Mutakkerin
p- 681, Vol. TI.)

" % He was author of the splendid Persian History of India entitled Setru-l-
Mutakkerm. He was 4 partisan of Mir Jafar and the Enghsh East India Com-
pany. Sirgju-d-daulah had ordered his banishment from the country.

8 He held the office of Deputy Governor of Jabangirnagar (Dacca) under
Ali Vardi Khan, whose son-in-law he was. He also held nominally the office
of Diwan of Bengal, though the practical work of Diwan was actually per-
formed by Hindu Deputy Diwans. Shehimat Jang had also at Jahaugirnagar

of Shahaimat Jang, on the plea that he should render up his accounts.
Although Rajballab tried hard to pay up some cash and to com-
promise the demands, Siraju-d-daulah did not consent, and kept
him under surveillance! Rajballab sent his family and children
to Calcutta, to take shelter with the Enghsh. Siréju-d-daulah
desired to arrest Rajballab’s family also, and ordered Rajah Ram,
head of his spies, to proceed to Calcutta, arrest Rajballab’s
family, and bring them over Mahabat Jang, whilst on sick-
bed, had dissuaded Sir&ju-d-daulah, and directed him to post-
pone the matter, and urged that after recovery he (Mahabat

quest of Calentta, and (5) conquest of Purniah When dispasmonately viewed,
the particular measures noted aboye (excepting one, namely the appointment
of Mohanlal) do not appear to have been unjustified, though they were
impohtic, Ghasiti Begam had no mght to take away and appropriate the
State treasures held in trust by her late husband, Shahamat Jang, All Vardi's
Diwan, and Siraju-d-daulah who hd lawfully succeeded Ali Vardi was, there-
fore, justified in recovering them from her. Mir Jafar had proved unfeithful
and treacherous even in the lifetime of Ali Vardi Khan in the struggle
with the Mahrattas (See the Ser), and Sirijn-d-danlah was, therefore, not
unjustified m suspecting him and dismissing him from the responsible office
of generalissimo of the army Rfybellab’s surveillance was a necessary
political measure, a8 this crafty man, the Deputy Diwan or Peshkar of
Jahangirnegar or Dacca under the late Shahamat Jang (Deputy Governor of
Dacea) had failed to render his accounts, and as Siraju-d-danlah had reasons
to beheve he (Rajbellab) had misappropriated a large part of the Pablic Funda
in his charge. And when Rajbellab’s son, Kighan Das, fled with the State
treasnres to Calentta, the Nawib was obliged to advance agamst Caleutta, to
recover the State treasures and chastise his rebel subject, Kishau Dag, thongh

cutta and arrest and bring over Rajballab’s family and children,
and himself in the month of Shaban, on the plea of tourmg, pro-
ceeded towards Akbarnagar (Rajmahal). Whilst Siraju-d-danlah
reaching Diinahpir had encamped on the bank of the river Kgla-
pani, he received news that the Enghsh Chiefs in Calcutta had
offered opposition, and prevented the arrest of Rajballab’s family
and children, On the very receipt of this news, the fire of Siraju-
d-daulah’s rage kindled, and he summoned the officers of his
army, and said: ‘I intend proceeding on an expedition against
Caleatta, It 1s necessary that none of you shonld go back to
Murghidabad, but that all should proceed straight from here to
Qhunakhali and encamp there.” Next morning, setting out,
Siraju-d-daulab reached @hunakhali, and from there proceeding by
forced marches invaded Calcutta, Inthe month of Ramzan, fight-
ing with the English, Siriju-d-daulah became victorious and triam-
phant, and the English Chief! embarking ona boat fled. Sweeping
the town of Calontta with the broom of plundo’, and naming 16
Alinagar, SirSju-d-daulah left Rajah Manikeband with a large
detachment as Governor of Calontta. Posting strong garrisons at
Makhiiah and Bajbajia (Budge-Budge) and other fords for the
crossing and passage of English ships, Siraju-d-dualah at the end
of the above month returned to Murghidabad,

Saulat Jang, Faujdar of Purniah, that year, previous to Mahi-
bat Jang’s death, in the month of Jamfédi-l-Awal, had died, and

% Thab Siriyn-d-danlah plandered Caloutta, is also mentioned m the Ibrat-
1-Avbab-t-Bagr, (p 29), 08 well as in the Seir (p 622, Vol, IT); but none of
these more or less contemporary Musalman accounts make any mention of
the ‘Black Hole’ incident, generally associated with Siraju-d-daulah's con-
quest of Caloutta.

The Seir states that Mr Drake, the English Chief in Calontte, with a small
number of English officers fled on a stip, whilst other Enghsh residenta ra+
mained behind in Caloutta, and fought to the last, so long as their powder and
shot were not exhausted’ Many of the English fell im this fight, whilst a
number of their comrades were ceptared. In this connection, the Ser also
mentions the fact that some English ladies who were captured m this fight
were well-treated by a Muhammadan nobleman, Mirza Amir Beg, who escorted
them honourably to Mr. Drake’s ship and received Mr. Drake's and other
English officers’ thanks for his humane and ghivalrons conduct. (Sea Ser,
Vol, Il, p. 622, Para, text).

his son, Shaukat Jang, who was @ cousin of Siraju-d-daulak, had
succeeded his father. At this time, Siraju-d-daulah desiring to
displace Shaukat Jang demanded the revenue of Purniah.! Shaukat
Jang replied. ‘“ You are lord of three Sibahs (Provinces), whilat
Iam fallen in this eorner, and am content with a bit of bread
Now it does not become your high aspiration to set the teoth of
your avarice on this bit of bread,” Siraju-d-daulah, on receipt of

1 The account in the Seir (Pers. text, Vol. II, pp. 624-682), is quite differ-
ent, and ig more reliable, as its anjhor was attached at the time as a Chief
Adviser to Shankit Jang. It would appear from the Sew that Mir Jafar, in
pursuance of his conspiracy to effect a Revolution, had written a letter to
Shaukat Jang requesting the latter to place himself at the head of the revo-
lationary party in view of the prospect of succeeding to the Nawabi of Ben-
gal. Shaukat Jang was a vain fool, and on receipt of Mir Jafar’s letter he
openly talked in Darbar of ns wild ambition to extend his empire te Ghazni
and Kandahar, and toconquer Benga! Sirijn-d-daulah hearing of the disloy-
alty that was brewing in the Purniah Court, depnted Rai Ras Behary (a son
of Rajah Janoki Ram and brother of Dulab Bam) to Purniah, with a letter to
Shaukat Jang, calling upon the latter to make over the Jagers of Gondwarah
and Birnagar (which pertamed to the Bengal Nizamat) to Rai Ras Behary.
When this letter was received, the author of the Ser (who was then Shankét
Jang’s principal adviser) being consulted advised Shaukat Jang to temporise,
to treat Rai Ras Behary with outward courtesy, to mobilise troops, and to pass
in this wise till the ramy season was over, when it was expected by the
author of the Ses (who appears to have bean in the confidence of the English)
the Enghsh would also fight against Siriju-d-daulah and that then Shaukit
Jang’s turn would come to join the winning party, However that may be;
Shaukat did not adopt the above advice, and sent an insolent reply to Sirdju-
d-daulah, adding that be (Shaukat Jang) had received sanad of the Subadar®
of Bengal, Behar, and Orissa, that Sirdyn-d-daulah had forfeited his head by
his disloyalty, but that as an act of grace he would be permitted to settle
down quietly in some corner of Jabangirnagér or Dacca. Siriju-d-danlah
answered the above insolent reply by at once advancing with his army to
Manihari, together with his Diwan Mohanlal. Ramnarain from Patna was
algo ordered to join Sirdju-d-daulah with the Patnaarmy. In this hattle which
took place between Manihari and Nawabganj, Shaukat Jang was killed,
through hia folly in leaving his entrenched position and marching throngh
marshy swamps. Siraju-d-daulah appointed Mohanlal to the office of Fauj-
dar of Parnish, and the latter left hie son as Deputy Fanjdur there.

I have given the above details from the Ser, in order to shew that the war
with Shaukit Jang was not of SirSju-d-danlah’s seeking, that 1t formed a
part of the conspracy hatched by Mir Jafar, in order to bring about a reyo-
lation to destroy Sivaju-d-danlah’s authority, and that Siriju-d-daolah had no
alternative but to fight in self-defence,

this reply, which did not satisfy his designs, despatched Diwin
Mohanlal, together with other Generals such as Dost Muhammad
Khan, Shaikh Din Muhammad, Mir Muhammad, and Jafar Khan,
&ec., with a large army, to fight with Shavkét Jang, and he also
wrote to Rimnarain, the Sibahdar of Azimabad, to march quickly
to Purniah. From the other side, Shaukat Jang detailed for
fighting Shaikh Jahin Yar and Karguzar Khan, the generalissimo,
and Mir Murad Ali and others, and subsequently he himself set ont
and assaulting and sacking and burning Haiatpirgolah 1eturned
to Porniah. On arrival at Maniham, Siriju-d-danlah’s army
encamped, whilet Shaukat Jang’s army ab a distance of one
Karoh at Nawabganj entrenched itself. On the next day, Shau-
kat Jang also arrived and joined his army; and on the same
day, Rajah Ramnariin, the Saibahdar of Azimabéd, with his
contingent of troops, joined Siriju-d-daulah’s army. On the
morning of the following day, Rajah Mohanlal advanced with his
force in order to fight, and unfurled his flag carryimg the ensignia
of the Mahi Order which he held. Shaukat Jang, on seeing the
ensigniaof the Mahi Order, fancied that Sirdju-d-daulah himself
had joined his army, and was marching up for fight, and so Shan-
kat Jang advanced also with his army. Shaikh Jahan Yar dis-
suaded Shaukat Jang, saying :—“ To-day the moment for fighting
is not auspicions, if it pleases God, to-morrow early in the morn-
ing we shall fight, and whatever 1s decreed by Providence shall
take place.” Shaukat Jang, paying no heed to this dissuasion,
marched up to the battle-field. Shaikh Jahién Yar was also obli-
ged to advance with his corps, and whilst fighting bravely he
received a gun-shot, Shaikh Abdu-r Raghid, his brother, and
Shaikh Qudratu-l-lah, his son-in-law, together with Shaikh
Jhahan Yar, his nephew, as well as his other kinsmen were slain
on the battle-field, and earned present and future glory. At this
time of strife, a sword fell on the neck of the horse of Shaikh
JahanYar, and cut asunder ita rein, and the horse furiously gal-
lopped away with its rider from the field. As he had already
received several mortal wounds, by the time of his arrival at Bir-
nagar, he expired. At that ccisis, Shaukat Jang, himself joining
in the fight, advanced, discharging arrows, and came in front of
Dost Muhammad Khan. The aforesaid Khan said, “ Come on my
elephant, as you will find svcnrity then.” Shaukat Jang not con-
senting fixed a sharp arrow in hig teeth, and shattered his front-

369

tooth, At this time, besides two horsemen, one of whom was Habib
Bag, no one else was with Shaukat Jang. Habib Bag dismount-
ing from his horse stood in front of his elephant on the field. As
decreed. by fate, a bullet from the gun of a servant of Dost Muham-
mad Khan hit Shaukat Jang on the forehead, and the bird of his
soul flew away, and nestled on the branches of annihilation. And
Kai guzar Khan, the generalissimo Shaikh Bahadur Narnuti, Abii
Tuib Khan, Muad Sher Khan, nephew of Shaikh Jahan Yar,
Shaikh Murad Ah, disciple of Nawab Saif Khan, Mir Sultan
Khalil, the archer, Loh& Singh Ha@za7, and Mir Jafaru-l-jo, &c.,
displayed gallant bravery, and tasted the potion of death on the
battle-field. Siraju-d-daulah had advanced to Akbarnagar (Raj-
mahal), when the tidings of victory arrived ; and he ordered the
music of victory to strike up. He also caused the adherents of
Shaukat Jang, such'as were captured, to be punished in various
forms. Rajah Mohanlal confiscating fifty-one elephants, and
horses, and camels, and other treasures of Shaukat Jang, and leav-
ing his own son as Deputy Governor of the Faujdari of Purniah,
returned,

When Sirdju-d-daulah, after the fall of his cousin, arrived in
Murghidabid, the chess-board of time presented a new game, Of
the English, who had been routed by Siraju-d-daulah in Calcutta,
and whose treasures worth several /aks had been plundered, some
escaped and fled to an island! Thence they sent messages to Eng-

1 The Sew (Vol II, p 6831, Pers. text), states that after hia flight, Mr.
Drake, the Chief of the Enghsh factory in Osloutta, together with a
number of other Enghsh officers, proceeded to Madras, in Arcot Province
of the Dakhin. Then Clive had just retired after fighting against the
French on behalf of Salabit Jang (son of the late Asif Jah), Nazim of the
Dakhin, who had bestowed on him many favours and also the title of Sabat
Jang, Then Mr. Drake, with other Englishmen, who had fled from Oalonttaheld
a conference with the Englishmen in Madras factory, and xt was decided that
Clive, together with the English refugees from Bengal, “should proceed ty
Calcutta and by every means that they thought deswable, should try to renew the
foundation of the Factory in Oaloutta. If by negactations and by payment of
money this object could be attaued, well and good ; sf not, force might be resort
ed to Then Chive, together with other Englishmen, embarked on a ship from
Madras, and reached at the mouth of the river Higli. As the English Chiefs
were very wige, brave, well-informed, and experienced, they made overtures of
peace to Siraju-d-daulah, begzed that Mr. Drake’s offence might be pardoned by
the Nawab, and offered to pay the Nawab several taks of rupees, in case the latter
granted’ them permuussion to re-build thew Factory as before in Caleutia. Sird-

ments. After some months, the English chiefs, under the com
mand of Sabit Jang (Clive), with thirty thousand men, arrived
on ships of war, obliged the garrisous of the Nawab’s outposts to
tuke to their heels, and fought with Rajah Manikobind. The
Rajeh suffered a heavy defeat. The English advancing to Hiagli,
rased its fortifications with the cunnonade of their artillery, and
the Faujdar of that Fort fled. Sir&ju-d-daulah, on getting news
of the English victory, set out for Calcutta from Murshidabad, and
encamped in the garden of Karhati, in the suburbs of Caleuttn
The English made a night-attack. The next day, Siraja-d-daulah
not having the boldness to advance, and outwardly proclaiming
the conclusion of peace, marched back anxiously to Murshidabad
After arrival in Murshidabad, Sir&ju-d-daulah found that all the
Nobles and Generals were disaffected, Foremost amongst them was
Mir Mohammad Jafar Khan Bahadur, from whom the office of
generaligsimo had been transferred to Khwajah Hadi Ali Khan,
and who had shut himself up in his house. Sirdju-d-daulah plac-
ing large batteries in front of Mir Jafar’s palace was ready to
blow him up, and ordered him to quit the City. Mir Jafar ten-
dering excuses and apologies, secretly set about making warlike
prepatations in self-defence, and tampering with the Bhaliah Geno-
rals and Commanders and with Jagat Set.! Ratifying their con-
spiracy by mutual oaths and promises, Mir Jafar sent secretly
Amir Bag, who was one of his confidential adherents, with letters

jv-d-daulsh who was very foolish, and whose courtiers were still more foolieh,
was unaware of the bravery and wisdom of the English race ; 80 that no one
from fear of inourrmg the Nawab’s displeasure, communicated to the Nawab
the Bnglish message containing overtures of peace. Matters bewng thus delayed,
and bewg tm the meantime apprised of the discontent amongst the Bengal nobles,
Clive resolved to fight, aud fought agamst Mamkohand, Nawab’s Govertor
of Caloutta, who fled.”

nent persons, lke Dolab Ram (son of Janoh, Ram) Jagat Set and Ghasit?
Begam (widow of Nawazish Muhammad Khan, son-in-law of Ali Vardi Khan),
were active colleagues of Mir Jafar in this conspiracy, Ghasiti Begam heiped
Mir Jafar with the State treasures that she had secreted One may understand
the resentment of Mir Jafar (who had been disgraced and dismissed from the
office of generalissimo) and of Ghasiti Begam (who had been obliged to dis+

it was Sn 4)a-d-daulah’s elevation of an obscure Hindu, named Mohanlal, té

Jafar also sent to Chve through the above Mirza a Manifesto, purporting tobear

them from the Nawab Jaget Set mstructed ne Calentta Agent, Ain
( known popularly as Omehand), to work in the same direction, whilst Dulab
Ram slso instracted his agent to influence the English in the same direction.
Mir Jafar wrote to Clive that the latter had only to make a move with
his Enghsh troops, when all the fighting would be done by Mir Jafar and
lus fellow-conspirators, whilet three crores of rupees would be presented te
Clive for thig service. Clive yielded to Mir Jafar’s importunities and ad-
vanced towards Palisi (Plassey). (See Seiru-l-Mutaiferin, Vol. II, p 687). In
regard to these events, Zarikk-i.Mansuri may also be referred to. Professor
Blochmann gives some notes from the Tartki-+-Mansuri in Journal of the Asia-
tic Society, Part I, No. II, of 1867. These notes mention that “ Chandernagoré
fell into the hands of Clive and Watson through the treachery of a Frénich
officer, named Tarranean, who harboured a grudge against the French Gover-
nor of Ohandernagore, named M Renault (p 88,J AS referred to above)

an attendant at the Court of the Nawab Strajn-d-daolak, for whom he fitted

went so far as to tear up a letter which Col. Chve had written to him Soon

“Ealy in June 1757, Clive left Calentta, reached on the 17th the sma!l

his tents on the morning of the 28rd, in the fields of Plassey The Nawab’s

the tents of Si:aju-d-daulah, but were vigorously opposed by Mir Madan (call-

amurs. About 12 o’clock Mir Madan was struck by a cannon-ball and carned
to Siriju-d-daulah’s tent, where he died. The fightmg was, however, continu-
ed, Mohanlal having taken Mir Madan’s place, But nothing decisive was
done. Afraid of a conspiracy Siriyu-d-daulah sent for Mir Jafar, who had
taken no part in the fight. After most earnest solicitations on the part of the
Nawab, Mir Jafar promised to fight the next day, on condition that Mohanlal
should be at once ordered to withdraw from the fight Siriyu-d-daulah
agreed, and Mohanlal returned to his tents. But no sooner did the troops see
their General had left the field than they became hopeless and began to flee,

states that the Hughsh had jomed Mir Jafar’s conspiracy, but as this wise
race do not, without some substantial reason, engage in hostilities, or break
treaties, they must have entered mto some correspondence with the Nawab,
and advanced some good reason (of which the author was not aware) for
breaking the treaty of peace Posmbly the reason was found in the delay m
the payment of the Nawab’s indemmity on account of the losses sustained
by the Enghsh during the capture of Calcutta by Siriju-d-danlah.

news of the advance of the English troops, marched out of the
City. Now taking out the cotton of recklessness from the ear,

Sevru-l-Mutakherin (Vol II, p 638). On hearing of Clive’s movement, Siraju-
d-daulah tried to conciliate his disaffected officers, who outwardly professed
loyalty to him, but inwardly plotted his rum, Siraju-d-davlah sent Rojeh
Dulab Ram (the traitor) ahead to Plassey, to supervise the construction of
redonbts and entrenchments, and shortly after moved up there nmself, with
his faithful officers, Mir Madan and Mohanlal and with the traitor, Mir Jafar.
Clivealso moved to Plassey with a small numberof English Telengi troops, num-
bering about 2,000 in all. Clive commenced the battle with a brisk cannonade,
whilst Mir Jafar stood by at a distance and watched the game Mir Madan
fought bravely till about 3 pM , and steadily advanced with Mohanlal close to
Clive’s;positior Seeing Mir Madan’s gallantry, Olive, it is said, was dispirited
and repronched Omichand for having falsely assured him that everyone was
disaffected against the Nawab, and that no one would fight for the latter.
As luck would however have i, at this time Mir Madan was hit by a cannon-
ball and wus removed to Siraju-d-daulah’s tent, where hedied Sirayun-d-
daulah now becoming anxious sent for Mir Jafar, beseeched the latter to fight
on his behalf, and even placed huis turban before the latter, and addressed this
arch-traitor as follows: “I now repent of my deeds, and in the name of re.
lationship that you bear to me, and inthe name of the bounties that yon
Yéceived fiom my grandfather, Mahabat Jang, I entreat you to defend my
hfe and honour ” ‘The pathetic appeal did not move the heart of this arch-
traitor who still harboured his treacherous designs under the mask of frend,
ship and who returned the following false answer : “To-day is at its close,
and the time for further fighting to-day 1s over To-day, order the battle to
cease; to-morrow I will fight for you with the whole army.” Sirayu-d-daulah
fell into Mir Jafar’s trap, and sent a message to his Diwan, Mohanlal, who was
contmuing the fight after Mir Madan’s fall, to return, Mohanlal said there
was no time to retarn now, as he was in the thick of the fight, which would
finally decide the fate Sirajn-d-daulah consulted Mir Jafar, who cunningly
repeated his former treacherous advice, and in consequence Mohanlal was
summoned back. Mohanlal’s return had a disastrous effect on Siraju-d-daulah’s
army, who dispersed in all directions. Siréju-d-danlah then returned swiftly to
Marghidabad, halted for some time at Mansurganj, but found he was surround-
ed on all sides by false comtiers and traitors So he left with his Begama
and gold for Bhagwangolah, whence on boats he sailed for Azimabad
sending at the same time a letter to Mons. Las to join him. Before Las’s
arrival, Siriju-d-danlah was on his way to Patna Owimgtohis Begams and
children having had no food for some days, Sirayu-d-daulah, whom misfortune
was dogging, landed at Raymahal, went to the house of a fakeer named Dana
Shah, who undertook ostensibly to prepare Khighr for him, but who mward-
ly harboured resentment against the Nawab, owing to previous ilJ-treatment

This fakeer promptly sent news of Sirayu-d-dauiah’s arrival to Mir Diiid
(brother of Mir Jafar), who was ab Rajmahal. Mir Daid and Mir Qasim Khin

he displayed towards the aforesaid Khan (Mir Jafar) fattery and
endearment, and sending the Begam of Mahabat Jang to Mir
Jafar opened the gates of apology for his past shortcomings
Mir Jafar did not listen to them, as he had no reliance on Sirdju-
d-daolah’s assurances and actions. After this, when Siraju-d-
daulah advanced from Qhunahkhali, the aforesaid Khan (Mir Jafar)
also marching encamped ata distance of half a farsakk from the
army of Sirdéju-d-danlah. Mir Madan, Superintendent of the Artl-
lery, told Siraju-d-danlah that the English were coming at the
instigation of Mir Muhammad Jafar, and that if, was, therefore,
expedient to finish first Mir Mahammad Jafar, and that after the
latter was killed, the Enghsh would not have the daring to ap-
proach this side. In that the arrow of Fate cannot be parried by
the shield of Effort, and in that God’s decree had already been
passed another way,

To the advice of that wise sage,
That light-hearted man (Siraju-d-daulah) was deaf.

When next day, Siraju-d-daulah reached Datidpir, tidings came

(son-in-law of Mir Jafar), came and captured Siraja-d-danlah, carried him to
Murghidabaid where he wae murdered by Mir Jafar.and hiason Miran. Siriyu-
d-danlah’s corpse was placed on an elephant and paraded The Ser winda
up its account of this tragic murder of Sirdju-d-danlah with the following

to the effect that the English had set fire to Katwih. At that
time Mohanlal reproached Siraju-d-daulah, and said: “You have
ruined me, and rendered my children orphans. If you had not
removed Mir Muhammad Jafar Khan and Dullab Ram from the
Katwah outpost, things would not have taken this turn.” In short,
onthe morning following that day, which was 5th Shawal of the
8rd year of the reign of Emperor Alamgir II, the English army
from Palasi (Plassey) on one side, and Siraju-d-daulah from Daiid-
pir on the other encountered each other, and opened the battle with
a cannonade. Mir Muhammad Jafar Khan, with his detachment,
stood at a distance towards the left from the main army; and
although Siraju-d-daulah summoned him to his side, Mir Jafar
did not move from his position. In the thick of the fightmg, and
in the heat of the work of carnage, whilst victory and triumph
were visible on the side of the army of Sirajn-d-daulah, all of a
sudden Mir Madan, commander of the Artillery, fell on being hit
with a cannon-ball. At the sight of this, the aspect of Siraju-d-
daulah’s army changed, and the artillerymen with the corpse of
Mir Madan moved into tents It was now midday, when the peo-
ple of the tents fled. As yet Nawab Sirfiju-d-daulah was busy
fighting and slaughtering, when the camp-followers decamping
from Daidpir went the other side, and gradually the soldiers
also took to their heels Two hours before sun-set, flight occurred
in Sirdju-d-daulah’s army, and Siraju-d-daulah also being unable
to stand ns ground any longer fled, On arrival at Mangirganj,
which had been founded by him, he opened the Treasury gates
and distributed money to the army. But owing to grave anxie-
ties, being unable to halt there, the Naw&b abandoning his trea-
sures and effects, at nightfall, with his wives and children, got into
a boat, carrying with himself a lot of precious jewelleries and gold
coins, and sailed towards Purniah and Azimabad. After Siraju-d-
daulah’s defeat, Mir Muhammad Jafar entered his camp, m the
night held a conference with the Huglish Chiefs, and early next
morning maiched in pursuit of Sirdju-d-daulah, and arrived in
Murshidabad. Finding the sky propitious towards his views,
Mir Jafar entered the citadel, struck up the masic aunouncing his
accession to the masnad of Bengal, issued proclamations of peace
and security in the City, and unfurled the standard of Sébahdari.
Mir Jafar then detailed his son-in-law, Mir Muhammad Qasim
with a corps to capture Siraju-d-daulah, and quartered the Eng-

ish army at Babniah.! But Siriju-d-danlah, travelling in the
night, had sailed swiftly from below Maldah, and reached Babial.
When news reached him that the mouth of Nazgirpir was unnavi-
gable and boats could not pass by that way, he was obliged to dis-
embark, and went to the house of Dan Shah Pirzidah, whose
house was at that place. Dan Shah who previous to this had
suffered some injury at the hands of Siraju-d-danlah, findimg the
latter in his power, and seeing the times favourable, by giving as-
surances and consolations, detained Sir&ju-d-daulah in his honse,
and ostensibly engaging on preparing food, sent information to
Mir Datid Ali Khan, Faujdaér of Akbarnagar (Rijmahbal), who
wns brother of Mir muhammad Jafar Khan. The spies of Daid
Ali Khan who were searching for Siriju-d-daulah, fancying it to
be a grand victory, ewiftly arrived, and capturing Siréju-d-daulah
carried him from the honse of Dan Ghah*® to Akbarnagar, from
whence the spies of Daid Ali Khan and Mir Muhammad Qasim
Khan carried him in their company to Murshidabad. Mir Muham-
mad Jafar Khan threw Siriju-d-danlah into prison that day On
the next day, with the advice of the English Chiefs, and on the
importunity and insistance of Jagat Set, he slew him, and sus-
pending the corpse of that victim of oppression to a howdah on
an elephant’s back, sent it round the City, and then buried it in
Khosh Bagh in the Mausoleum of Nawab Mahabat Jang. After
some days, Mir Jafar killed also Mirza Mihdi Ali Khan, the
younger brother of Siraju-d-daulah, by stretching him on an
instrument of torture, ahd buried his body by the side of his
brother’s grave: The Nizimat of Nawab Sirdju-d-daulah ® lasted

daulah’s administration.

The Ibrat-i-Arbab-1-Bagr (p. 26) characterises Sirdju-d-danlah ag ‘light-
hearted, unsparing, self-willed, petulant, short-tempered and sharp-tongned *
The Sevru-l-Mutakhern (vol II, p 621) states in condemnation of Siraju-d-
daulah that Siriju-d-daulah’s ‘ harsh and uncouth utterances, his derision and
jesting in respect of the officers of his Government caused resentment in
their hearts.’ If this be what constituted the head and front of his offending,
—if this be what exhausts the catalogue of his sins, then one has to materi-
ally modify the generaity current view of Siriju-d-daulah.

The explanation accounting for the tragic fate of Siraju-d-danlah is, how-
ever, attempted by the author of the Ibrat-t-Arbab-i-Bagr (p. 32). This aythor

NIZAMAT OF SHUJAU-L-MULK JAFAR ALI KHAN.

When Jafar Ali Khan ascended 1 the masnad of the Niz&mat of
Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, he set himself to the conciliation of the

states, in effect, that Siraju-d-daulah wasn victim of intrigues and misfor-
tunes left as a legacy by his grandfather, Ali Vardi Khan, who had inaugu-
rated in Bengal an ara of violent intrigues and dark treachery, by killing his
own master, Nawab Sarfariz Khan (son of Ali Vardi’s benefactor, Nawab
Shujan-d-din Khan), and who was, therefore, now punished by an Avengmng
Providence in the person of his grandson Siriju-d-danlah, whom Ali Vardi
had regarded as dearer than his own life. That Siriju-d-daulah did not bring
on the misfortunes on himself by his own incapacity, is proved by what the
Bev u-l-Mutakkerin (Vol II, p 688), states, namely, that ‘Sirija-d-daulah had
attained the zenith of power and opulence, and that, therefore, a declension
was inevitable according to the laws of nature’

This Revolution in the history of Bengal which in effect supplanted Moslem
Rule and made the Hoglish virtually supreme m this couutry, may also ba
viewed in another aspect as a wise Dispensation of Providence for the ulti-
mate good of the people. At the time, it is abundantly clear, the people in
Bengal were sunk in the abyss of moral debasement, and the cankers of dark
ingratitude and treachery, untrathfniness and venshty had crept deep into the
vitals of their hearts. In the pursuit of the phantoms of individual self-
aggrandisement and of personal ambitions, they had taken advantage of the
youthful failings of their sovereign and of the internecine jeslousies that
distracted hia family, forgotten and forsaken ll sentiments of gratitude and
honour, and yielded to their mstinct of- intrigue by fraternising with the
Nawab’s disloyal relation, Mir Jafar. These, therefore, verily needed a
Chastener—a Moses—to save them from further moral dissolution ; and so
Providence in His inscrutable wisdom sent to them One from across the seas
iu the person of the English, to scourge the vices of the land, to chasten the
people, to purify and re-form them, and to once more, if possible, to rescue
them from the sea of moral annihilation.

1 See the account in the Seir (Vol. II, p. 640) After the battle of Plassey,
Mir Jafar and Ohve had a conference on the battlefield, and they together
entered Murshidabad Mir Jafar occupied the palace of Mangurganj, which
was the residence of Siraju-d-daulah, and then visited the Nigamat Treasury,
in order to distribute the treasures between himself, Dulab Ram, and Clive,
as had been agreed to mutually, Dulab Ram now became Mir Jafar’s most
influential colleague in the administration Theu friendship, however, did not
last long, and shortly after Dulab Ram contemplated placing Siraju-d-daulah’a
brother, Mirza Mahdi, on the masnad See Seir, Vol, II, Pers. text, p 644).

army and the nobility, who had joined him in his conspiracy to
destroy Siriju-d-daulah. He appointed his nephew, Khidim
Husain Khan,! to the office of Faujdaér of Purniah, and conferred
on R&mnarain a robe of honour, confirming him in the Deputy-
Governorship of the Sibah of Azim&bad (Patna). ?

At this time Shah Alam’ invaded the Sabah of Azimabad.

1 See Seir (Vol. II, p. 645), for an account of Khadem Husain Khan.
Khadem Husain Khin’s father, Syed Khadem Ali Khan, was husband of Mir
Jafar’s sister, but Khadem Husam was not from this sister, but born of
another wife of Khadem. Khadem Husain was a boon companion of Mir
Jafar, who was fond of pleasures and caronsals (p. 645, Vol. II, Sew)

& Mir Jafar was quite incompetent for the office of Subadar of Bengal. As
soon as he ascended the masnad of the Nigamat, he flung himeelf into pleasures,
neglected State affairs, and left them in the hands of his son, Miran, and
others Jahangir Nagar or Dacca fell into the hands of Rajballab, Diwan of
Mirah ; thig Rayballab in the time of the late Shahamat Jang was peshkar
of Shahamat Jang’s Diwan, Husain Qui Khan. Bardwan and some other
districts were ceded to the English, in lien of cash payment of part of the
Bengal revenue. Hugh was assigned to Mir Beg Khan, who had rendered
good services to the Enghsh. Rajah Rimnardin became supreme administrator
of BihSr, whilst Purniah was bestowed on Khadem Husain Khan (See Seir,
Vol. If, p. 651). Ib 18 stated in the Ser that shortly after Mir Jafar’s acces-
sion, people got tired of him and his son Miran, and sighed back for the old
days of Sixaya-d-daulah, whom they regarded now as better in all respecta
than Mir Jafar (Se:ru-l-Mutakherim, Vol. II, p, 656)

8 A detailed account of this will be found in the Seiru-2-Mutakherin, Vol II,
p. 656. It appears thiat many of the noblemen in Bihar and Bengal soon got
into thorough disgust with Mir Jafar and bis son, Miran, and opened corres-
pondence with Muhammad Quh Khan, Subadar of Allahabad (# cousin of
Shujau-d-daulah, and a nephew of Safdar Jang). Muhammad Quli Khin took
counsel with his cousin, Shujau-d-daulah, Subadar of Oudh, who inwardly
harboured ill-fesling towards his cousin and aimed at his ruin, gave him
false advice, \and encourged him to invade Bihar and to carry with him
Prince Ali Ganhar, surnamed Shah Alam (who was heir of Bmperor Alamgi: IT).
Ali Gaphar was harassed at this time by Imadu-]-Mulk, and was staying with
Najibu‘d-dauiah Najib Khan Afghan at Miranpur, Ghaturah Aft first Rim-
naréin, Deputy-Governor of Bibir, took counsel with Mr. Amytt, the Chief
of the English Factory at Patna, enqured what course of action he should
adopt, and suggested that the English should help him in opposing Prince Ali
Gauhar’s mvasion, Mr. Amytt said he could give no decisive answer. Find-
ing that no help was cqming from the Nazim of Bengal, Mir Jafar, nor from
the Enghsh, Rimnariim became anxious, opened political courtesies with
Prince Gauhar and Muhammad Quli Khan, wasted on them in Durbar, and
professed allegiance to the Prince. Both the Prince and Muhammad Qali

Khan being thus re-assured, let Ramnarain return to the fort be Azimibad
Shortly after, on getting news of the approach of Miran and the Hnglish,
Rimnaréin threw off his mask of loyalty to the Prince and Muhammad
Quli Khan The latter pressed the siege of Patna, assaulted the Fort,
end Ramnarain being hardpressed was about to surrender and run away.
Then news arriving that Shujau-d-daulah by a foul trick had made himself
master of the Fort of Allahabad, which was held by his cousin Muhemmad
Qali Khan, the latter together with Prmce Ali Gauhar abandoned the siege
of Patna, and withdrew towards Allahabad. (See p. 669, Seis, Vol. II) At
this time, Mons. Las met the Prince, persuaded the latter to attack again
Patna, but the latter acknowledged his mabuility to do so, owing to want of
fonds If, at this time, Shujau-d-daulah, instead of being meanly treacherous
to his cousin, had supported him, the fate of Bihar might have been different
See Mons Las’s observations on the point quoted in the Sew (Vol II, p. 670).
At Benares, Mohammad Quh Khin’s march was opposed under orders of
Shujau-d-daulah, whilst Prince Ali Gauhar with Mone Las was allowed to
pass on v4 Mirzapur to Chattarpur towards Bundelkund. Muhammad Quit
Khan was carried to Shuyan-d-daulah who had the meanness to imprison him
In the meantime, Miran with Col. Chve came to Patna, and Ramnarain
waited on them, whilst apparently amicable relations were opened between
them and Prince Ali Gauhar, through the diplomatic correspondence of Ghu-
Jam Husain Khin, author of the Ser (See Sew, Vol. 1], p 674).

Shortly after, on the invitation of Diler Khan and Kamgar Khan, Zamundar of
Tirhut Samai, Prince Ali Gauhar agam invaded Patna. At this time, the
English army under Captain Cockrane supported Ramnarain. Mr. Amytt was
still the Ohief of the English Factory at Patna, whilst Dr. Fullerton was
attached to the Factory as the medical officer. The author of the Sar
(Ghulam Husam Khan) was ao friend of Dr Fullerton, and was the latter’s
guest atthetime. (See Ser, Vol II, p.676) At this time Emperor Alamgir II
was treacherously murdered under orders of Imadu-]-Mulk (See Setr, Vol. IT,
p. 676), and Ali Gauhar consulted Ghulam Husam Khjin’s father, who resided
at the time in Husaiabad in Bihar Province and proclaimed himself Hm-
pero: under the tntle of Shah Alam in 1173, A OW, appointed Shujau-d-daulah
as his Viner, and Najibu-d-daulah as bis General. Then Kamgar Khin
Main and Asalat Khin and Diler Khan met the Emperor, and induced the
latter to invade Bihir. At this tame, Rimnaram was encamped on the
banks of the river Dhanah, At this battle, Shah Alam defeated Ramnariin,
who was wounded The English army who supported Rimnarim and were
led by Captain Cockrane and Mr. Barwal, wee also defeated and dispersed ;
and Patna fell into the hands of the Emperor (See Sew, Vol II, p. 678) At
this battle, Diler Khan and Asalat Khin, sonsof Umar Khan, fought and fell
heroically on the side of the Emperor Shortly after, Miran, with the Eng-
lash troops under Colonel Clive armved. On the side of the Emperor, Kam-

of Sir&ju-d-daulah, whom Jafar Ali Khan had previously from
policy shifted to the province of Bihar, now joined the Imperial
Army. At Fatihah, a battle took place between the Imperialists
and Rimnaraéin. Ramnarain was wounded, and fled to the fort,
and the Imperial troops laid siege to the fort. Nawab Jafar Ali
Khan, on getting this news, despatched to Bihar his son, Nawab
Nasiru-!-Mulk Sadiq Ali Khan Shahaimat Jang, surnamed Miran,
with a detachment of Enghsh troops. On the banks of the river
Adhiiah, adjoining Barh, a battle ensued with the Imperialists.
On the side of the Imperiahsts, Qadidid Khan and Kaimgar
Khan displayed feats of bravery. Muhammad Amin Khan was
wouuded, whilst Rajballab fell back, and both contemplated fight,
Qadirdad Khan, with others, by biave onslanghts, attacked the
lunes of artillery. A heavy gun, which required to be drawn by
400 bullocks, happened to he in front of these. Those men got
entangled amidst the bullocks, and tailed to cut through as the
bullocks hemmed them on all sides At this juncture, the ale-
phant-driver of Qadirdad Khan was shot by a bullet Qdadirdad

gar Khan, Qadirdad Khin, Ghulam Shah were the Generals Qadirdad Khin
made a bold movement to the rear of Miran, heroically fought, killed Muabam-
mad Amin Khan (maternal uncle of Mian), wounded Miran, and worked
havoc in Miran’s amy Muran fled, Then the Enghsh opened a brisk can-
nonade, and one cunnon-ball hit Qadirdad Khin who was killed. Then the
tide of victory turned in favour of Miran, whilst Kamgar Khin, with the
Empeior, proceeded towards Bihar (Sew, Vol II, p 680). Now Kamgar
Khan, with the Emperor, contemplated surprising Murshidabad, and proceed-
ed to Bardwin. Mir Jafar, with the English army and Ins own troops, pro-
ceeded to Bardwin. Kamgar Khin with the Emperor now turnel back
towards Azimabad, winle Mons, Las also arrived (Sew, Vol II, p 680). At
this time Khadim Hasain Khan and Dulab Ram (who had got sick of his old
fellow-conspirator, Mir Jafar) sent help secretly to the Emperor. ‘he Bm-
peror and Kamgar Khan with Mons Las and Zaimu-d-din Khiin now assanit-
ed the fort of Patua. The assaults were vigorously repeated, and the fort
was about to fall, when a company of Enghsh troops under Captun Knox
brought timely reinforcement, and raised the sieges The Emperor with
Kamgar Khan now went some distance from Patna, and was busy collecting
revenue, In the meantime, Khadim Husain, who bore an old grudge to
Moran, moved to Hajipur with a large number of troops to attack Patna, but
was defeated by Captain Knox who was supported by Shitab Rai (Seir, Vol. IT,
p. 686). Shortly after Miran, with Colonel Chve and another Enghsh army,
arrived, and pursued Khadim Husain Khan, who felt himself too weak to
oppose their united forces, and retired towards Bitiah, where of a might Miran
was killed by lightuing, whilst sleeping in his tent. (See Sevr, Vol. II, p. 688).

Khan spurred on his elephant with his feet, and shot arrows.
Nawab Sadiq Ali Khan received a wound, being hit by an arrow.
At this moment, a big cannon-ball hit Qadirdid Khan on the left
side of the chest, and finished him up On seeing this mishap,
Kamgar Khan and others reming back their horses fell back to
their own lines The army of Sadiq Ali Khan, on ascertaining
this, made a fresh onslaught, attacked the Imperialists, and struck
up the music of victory. The Imperialists were defeated. Rahim
Khan and Zainu-]-Abidin Khan, who had made a detour towards
the rear of Sadiq Ali Khan’s army, on hearing the music of
victory, made a flank movement towards the right wing, and
attacked it. But owing to the cannonade of the English artillery,
they were unable to stand their ground, and were defeated. After
defeat, the Imperiahsts retired towards Bardwan, and Sadiq Ali
Khan, pursuing them, followed them up to Bardwan vid Qhakai,!
Khauti,? and Birbhim. From this side, Jafar Ali Khan also
marched expeditiously to Bardwan, and on the banks of the river 8
below the town of Bardwin, a battle commenced with a cannon-
ade. The Imperialists not being able to hold their own there,
marched back to Azimabad.

Jafar Ali Khin and Sadiq Ali Khan now set, themselves to con-
fiscate the treasures and effects of Nawab Siraju-d-daulah and the
Begams of Mahabat Jang, &e, Rendering the latter hard up for
even a night’s sustenance, they had already sent to Jahangirnagar
(Dacea), the Begam of Mahébat Jang' with her two daughters,
one named Amanah Begam,* mother of Siraju-d-daulah, and
the other named Ghasit? Begam, widow of Shahaémat Jang, to-
gether with other ladies 6f Mahabat Jang’s harem Jafae Ali
Khan and Sadiq Ali Khan now sent Baqir Khan, the General,
to Jahangirnagar (Dacca) with a corps of one hundred cavalry, and

directing the latter to capture and make over Ghasiti Begam and

On the arrival of Bagir Khin at Jahéngirnagar, Jasarat Khan!
was obliged to pass the necessary orders. The Begams were
placed on a boat, which was taken out some karoh from Jahangir-
nagar and there sunk in the river. It is said that when the
Begams were taken out to the boat, and became aware of their
fate, they repeated their prayers, held the Holy Qoran in their
armpits, embraced each other, and then plunged into the river.
O, Gracious God, what mhuman barbarity was this! But at
length, Sadiq Ali Khan also suffered retribution for it in bis own
life-time.*

At this time a misunderstanding had set in between Sadiq Ali
Khan and Khaidim Husain Khan, on account of levy of revenue
and also of other matters. Sadiq Ali Khan, resolving 66 expel
and extinguish Khadim Husain Khan, planned an expedition to
Purniah. Khadim Husain Khan advancing with his troops from
Purninh, entrenched himself at Gandahgolah (Caragola) for fight-
mg. Then, all of a sudden, news arrived that the Imperialists had
besieged the fort of Azimabad (Patna), and were fighting with
Ramnarain. Consequently, Sadiq Ali Khan, abandoning his
contemplated expedition to Purniah, set out for Azgimabid.
Khaidim Husain Khan, not considering himself a match for
him, set out for the Imperial Capital. From this (1.¢., the south-
ern) side of the Ganges, the army of Sadiq Ali Khan, and from
that (7.¢., the northern) side of the Ganges, Khadim Husain Khan

1 To the credit of Jasirat Khan, Paujdar of Dacca or Jahangirnagar, it 1s
related in the Sew that he had declmed to be a party to such a diabolical
murder, and had offered to resign his post. It appears from the Sew Mir Jafar
subsequently hoaxed Jssirat Khan, and induced the latter to make over to
Baqyr Khin the two Begams, on the plea that they would be safely lodged
at Murshidabid, now that Miran had left that place for Bihar,

* That Mir Jafar and his son, Miran, were despicable tyrants, is sufficiently
attested by this diabolical murder There 1s nothing to match such inhuman
barbamty in the recoid of the much-abused Siriju-d-daulah. See Serru-l-
Mutakkermm, Vol II, p 689. It appears Ammoh Begam, before plunging into
the river, prayed to God that Miran might meet with retribution and be killed
by hghtning for hig barbarous mhumanity in causing her and her sister’s death.
Tt 1s further stated 2n the Sew that Miran was killed by lightning in Ins tent
the same night that Ghasiti Begam and Aminah Begam (daughters of Ali Vardi
Khin Mahibat Jang, and wives of Shahamat Jang and Haibat Jang respec-
tively) met with a watery grave in the wer below Dacca

marched up, And when news of the approach of Sadiq Ali
Khan spread at Azimabad, the Imperialists raising the siege of
the fort, of Patna retired by the highway towards Munir. Sadiq
Ali Khan, thus finding himself at leisure, crossed the river, and
marched in pursuit of Khidim Husam Khan. Khadim Husain
Khén marched forward with the swiftness of lightning and wind,
whilst Sadiq Ali Khan hotly pursued him from behind, making
forced marches. At this juncture, a storm of wind and rain
came on and disabled both the horsemen and the horses from
action, Khadim Husain Khan reached the bank of a river,! to
ford whieh was difficult, and to cross which without a ferry
boat was impossible, The army of hhadim Husain Khan, like
the Israelites of old, finding the river in front and the enemy in
the rear, despaired of hfe. Finding all ways of escape cut off,
Khadim Husam Khin of necessity flung his treasures and heavy
baggages amongst his soldiers, and placing his trust in his God and
looking up to the Infallible Artist, looked out for supernatural
help. The army of Sadiq Ali Khan, having had to march through
mud and clay and being drenched through by a heavy shower
of rain, were rendered unfit for fighting, and halted that day ata
distance of 2 karoh from Khadim Husain Khén. In that the cup
of the life of Khadim Husain Khan and his companions was yet
not full to the brim, at midnight a lightning fell on Sadiq Ali
Khan, and killed him and his personal attendant. This mishap
occurred in 11738 A.H. Kha&dim Husain Khan, thus geting
providentially rescued from the claws of certain death, marched
away with the speed of lightning and wind, and went to the
Stibah of Audh (Oudh). Réajballab * and other comrades of Sadiq
Ali Khan rubbed the ashes of sorrow and anguish on their heads,
and together with the English army retired to Azimabid. There
they directed their attention towards the Imperial army, molud-
ing the Emperor’s Mahratta Contingent, who were encamped at
Hilsah, and commenced warfare. The Imperialists were again
defeated, and the French General ® who was in the company of

the Emperor was captured, whilst Rajballah followed up to Bihar.
When the Imperialists marched towards Gya-Manpir and Kam-
gar Khan fled to the hills, Rajballab thought of returning. But
at this moment, news arrived to the effect that Nawab Jafar Ali
Khan was a prisoner, and that Nawab Qasim Ali Khan! had
acquired the Siibah of Bengal, as will be related hereafter. The
period of the Nizimat of Nawab Mir Muhammad Jafar Ali Khan
lasted about three years.

NIZAMAT OF ALIJAH NASIRU-L-MULK IMTIAZU-D-
DAULAH QASIM ALT KHAN BAHADUR NASRAT JANG.

Nawab Jafar Ali Khan had sent to Calcutta his kinsman, Mir
Muhammad Qasim’ who was a son of Nawab Imtiaz Khan, snr-
named Khilis, to represent him at the Conference regarding the
Administration aud settlement of the apportionment of 10 annas of
the revenue to Jafar Ali Khan and six annas to the English, and
regarding the enjoyment of the office of Diwan by Jafar Ali Khan.
On the death of Sadiq Ali Khan, the Army demanding their pay
which had fallen into arrear for some years mutinied in a body,
besieged the Nawab in the Chihtl Satin Palace, and ont off
supplies of food and water. In consequence, the Nawab wrote to
Mir Muhammad Qasim Khan to the effect that the army had
reduced him to straits for demand of arrear pay. Mir Muham-
mad Qasim Khan, im concert with Jagat Set, conspired with
the English Chiefs, and induced the latter to write to Nawab
Jafar Ali Khan to the effect that the mutiny of the army for

i Mir Qasim wasa son-in-law of Mir Jafar, who had conferred on the former
the Faujdari of Parniah in addition to that of Rangpur. Mir Qisim went on
some State business to Calcutta, and there made an impression on Mr. Vansit-
tart, who had now succeeded Clive as Governor of Calcutta At this time,
the pay of the army being in arrear, the latter besieged Mir Jafar in his
palace. With the help of the English Council in Calcutta, Mir Qisim now
became Nazim of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, mm supercession of Mir Jafar, who
had proved himself an meapable ruler, (See Sei, Vol. II, p. 695). Mir
Qasim owed his installation chiefly to Mr. Vansittm t, the Governor of Calcutta,
and his colleague in the Council, Mr. Hastings, both of whom went for the
purpose to Mnrshidibid Mir Jafar came to Calcutta and remained there

was a son of Imtiaz Khin, surnamed Khals.

demand of pay was a very serious matter, and that it was ad-
visable that the Nawab abandoning the Fort should come down
to Caleutta, entrusting the Fort and the Sibah to Mir Muhammad
Qasim Khan.! Mir Muhammad Qasim with full self-confidence,
on attaining his aim, returned to Murshidabad. The English
Chiefs leaguing with Mir Muhammad Qasim Khan brought ont
Nawab Jafar Khan from the Fort, placed him on a boat, and
sent him down to Calcutta. Mir Qasim Khan entered the Fort,
mounted the masnad of Nizémat, and issued proclamations of
peace and security in his own name. He sent a message to Raj-
ballab? to bring back the Emperor to Azimabad, whilst he himself
afterwards set out for Azimabad, in order to wait on the Emperor,
after attending to and reassuring his army, and making some
settlement in regard to their arrears of pay. Leaving his uncle,
Mir Turab Ali Khan, as Deputy Nazim in Murshidabad, Mir
Qasim carried with himself all his effects, requisites, elephants,
horses, and treasures comprising cash and jewelleries of the
harem, and even gold and silver decorations of the Imaimbéra,
amounting to several laks in value, and bade faewell to the
country of Bengal. After arriving at Monghyr, and attending
to the work of strengthening its fortifications,’ he marched to

1 Mir Jafar proved himself thoroughly mcapable, In whatever light his
character 18 viewed, he appears to have been much worse than the much-
abused Sirdju-d-danlah. Though much older than the latter, Mir Jafar was
unquestionably inferior to the latter in qualities both of head and heart,
As a general or an administrator, Siréju-d-daulah was superior to him,
whilst as a man, Siraju-d-daulah was much better than Mir Jafar or his
infamous son, Mirdn. The Sei states that shortly after the Revolution,
even Mir Jafar’s old adherents sighed back for the days of Siraju-d-
daulah. Mir Jafar was even incapable of retaming the friendships or
attachments of his fellow-conspirators, Dulab Ram and Jagat Set. After as-
cending the masnad of Nizamat, Mir Jafar gave himself up to pleasures
and debancheries, thongh he was an elderly man, and neglected State affairs
which fell into confusion. Mr. Vanstttart and Mr Hastings contemplated at
first that Mir Jafar should be allowed to retain his titles and privileges as the
Nazim of Bengal, whilst Mir Qisim should act as Administrator-General or
Regent on his behalf. In this arrangement, Mir Jafar refused to acqniesce, and
so he was brought down a pusoner to Calcutta, whilst Mir Qiisim was pro-
claimed Nawab Nazim of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa. (See Sew, Vol IT, p. 695 )

& Rajballab was at this time in Patna in charge of Miran’s army, os Miran
had been killed by lightning

8 From the Sc:r, Vol, IT, Pers, text, p. 711, it appears that Mir Qasim went

886

Azimabad (Patna), in order to wait on the Emperor. Before
Mir Qasim’s arrival at Azimabad, the Emperor had returned
to that place, and the English going forward to receive him
had accommodated His Majesty in their own Factory.! Sub-
sequently, Qasim Ali Khan also arrived, had the honour of an
audience with the Emperor, and received from the latter the
title of Nawab Ali Jah Nagira-l-mulk Imtiazu-d-daulah Qasim Ali
Khan Nasrat Jang. But the officers of the Emperor marking
some change in the conduct of Qasim Ali Khan marched back
with the Emperor to Baniras, without givmg any intimation
thereof ts the aforesaid Khan.2 Nawab Qasim Ali Khan followed

to Monghyr and resided there in 1175 A.H, after having finished his expedi-
tions to Tirhut, Shahabad, and Azimabid, and after having left Rajah Naubat
Rai as Depnty Sabadar of Patna, in place of Ramnarain and Rajballab who
were imprisoned. (See Seir, Vol II, p.711). Two days every week, the
Nawab dispensed justice, attended personally to every State affair, and listen-
ed patiently to the complaints and grievances of everyone, however humble
his position, and did not permit corruption or bribery to thwart the course of
justice. He paid assiduous attention to the happmess of his people and to the
comfort of his army, which he placed in a highly efficient state, He was,
however, ® terror to enemies and wrong-doers, and his vigo.ous personality
pervaded all affairs of the State Friends and foes ahke respected him, and
even the English regarded him as a real power in the land, and not as a
shadow like Mir Jafar. He respected learning and the learned, and appre-
ciated the company of scholars, savants, and saints. The one fatal mistake
that he made was that he trusted implicitly the Armenian cut-throat, Gurgan
Khan, who was the generalissrmo of his Army and who was sectetly bent
on ruining him, and this one fatal mistake which embroiled him in a quariel
with the English subsequently proved disastious to his power. See Serru-l-
Mutakherwn, Vol. IJ, p. 712.

1 It appears the English General, Major Carnac, concluded a truce with the
Emperor, established amicable relations with him, and induced the latter to
come to Patna. At this time, the moves of the pawns on the political chess-
board of India were qnick and strange and inconsistent. Everyone was after
his game of self-interest, regardless of traditions and of sentiments, (See
Seir, Vol. II, pp 700, 708-704). At this time Ahmad Shah Abdali had again
invaded India, defeated the Mahrattas, and instructed Shujau-d-daulah,
Najibu-d-daulah and other Afghans to show allegiance to Emperor Shih
Alam who was his brother-in-law. (See Se:r, Volt II, p 706)

4 There does not appear to be any authority for this statement It would
appear that agreeably to the inst uction left by Ahmad Shah Abdali who had
inflicted a crashing defeat on the Mahrattas, Shujau-d-danlah, Subadar of
Oudb, had come at the time to the borders of Oudb, to receive the Emperor

them up to the confines of Baksir and Jagadishpir, and after pillag-
ing those places returned to Azimabad, halted at the residence
of Ramnarain, and set himself to the work of administration of
the affairs of that place.!

When Qasim Ali Khan demanded from the English duties
on their trade-goods, the latter refused to pay the same, and
carried on their trade duty-free? Nawab Qasim Ali Khan

See Seiru-l-Mutakherin, Vol. II, pp. 705-706.

l Important administrative changes transpired at this time. Nawab Mir
Qasim called for accounts from Rimnarain, who was Depniy Subadar of
Behar. Finding that Ramuardin had been guilty of malversation in respect
of large amounts of the public revenues, the Nawib dismissed him from office
and threw him into prison, at the same time confiscating all his treasures.
Shitab Rai, who was Ramnariain’s colleague, was also suspected, and dismigs-
ed by the Nawab, who took into his own hands the direct administration of
Behar, retammg, however, Rajballab as his Deputy there. See Sei, Vol. II,
p. 707. Subsequently Rajballab was thrown into prison, his office being
given to Rajah Naubat Rai, who was replaced shortly after by Mir Mehdi
Khan. Gurgan Khan, an Armenian, was placed at the head of the Artillery ’
and the Nawib placed implicit confidence in him. But as later events would
shew, this Armeman proved a traitor. The Nawab employed a large num-
ber of spies, and thus kept himself well info.med of everything that trans-
pired. He also appointed Mir Mehdi Khin as Fanjdar of Tirhut, and
Mahammad Taq Khan as Fanjdar of Birbhum.

8 This was the beginning and ostensible cause of the rapture between
Nawab Qisim Ali and the Enghsh. The Sew (Vol II, p. 715), details these
important events In 1176 A H., Mr. Henry Vansittart, then acting as Gov-
ernor of the English Hast India Company in Calcutta, visited the Nawib at
Monghyr, and held a conference with him on various matters. The Nawab
then told Mr. Vansittart that much trade passed through the conntry duty-
free, as it was given out that it was on behalf of the English, that in conse-
quence the State suffered a heavy loss, and that it was proper that duty should
be levied on all such goods, except those particularly belonging to the Enghsh
East India Company Mr Vansittart informed the Nawab not to do any-
thing in the matter in haste, but to wait till his return to Calcutta, when pro-
per orders on the subject would be passed by him and communicated to the
Nawab, The Nawab on the strength of this felt sanguine that his request
would be complied with, and in the meantime wrote to ns Collectors (Amuls),
directing them to be vigilant in regard to permitting goods to pass duty-free,
and adding that full orders would be communicated to them hereafter. These
Amils in some cases exceeded their authority by stopping goods, with the
result that several of them were imprisoned by Mr. Hiligon, of the Patna Fac.
tory, and by Mr. Batteson, of the Dacca Factory, and sent to Calcutta, The
Nawab, on hearing this, directed reprisals, and ordered the arrest of the gomash.

remitted thereupon the duties leviable from all the traders of
Bengal and Behar, and declared that so long as he failed to levy
duties from the rich, he would hold back his hand from doing so, in
the case of the poor. Owing to this cause, and owing to some other
matters, a misunderstanding set in between him and the English
chiefs. The Nawab now hatched plans for exterminating them.
Atlength, he formed the resolution of putting them all to the sword
on one day. In pursuance of this plan, he sent despatches to his
Deputies and Faujdars in Bengal to the effect that on a cer-
tain fixed date everywhere, they should by means of treachery
or violence massacre all the English residents. And after perso-
nally giving peremptory injunctions to the Generals of his army
to kill and capture and pillage and plunder the English, he return-
ed to Monghyr. And when on the day fixed, the army of Qasim
Ali Khan prepared to discharge their commissioned task, a battle

tas of the English, and remitted duties on all goods, explaining that when
the goods of richer traders were to be exempt from duties, it would be inequit-
able to levy duties on goods of poorer traders who contributed only a fraction
to the State revenue. The Coancil in Calcutta sent Mr. Amytt as their envoy to
the Nawab to Monghyr to settle matters (p. 720, Ser, Vol. IJ). Mr. Vansittart
also sent a friendly letter to the Nawab requesting the latter to concede the
demand of the Council. The Nawib consulted his general, the Armenian
Gurgan Khan, who advised the Nawab not to listen to Mr. Vansittart’s
advice (p. 760, Sew, Vol. II). Inthe meantime, Gurgan Khan had caused
the flower of the Nawab’s Army to perish in a fruitless expedition for
the conquest of Nepal (p. 717, Vol. II, Seir.) The Nawab now solicited aid
from Nawab Vizier Shujau-d-daulah and the Emperor, in order to repel the
encroachments of the English (p. 718, Seu, Vol. II). The Nawab also wrote
to his capable and loyal Faujdar of Birbhum, Muhammad Tagqi Khan, to send
Jagat Set Mahtab Rai and his brother, Maharaja Surupehand, grandepns of
Jagat Set Fatehchand, from Murshidibad to Monghyr under proper escort, and
Mubammad Taqi Khan accordingly sent them to Monghyr, where they were
ordered to reside under surveillance (p. 721, Setr, Vol. II). On hearing that
Mr, Amytt was commg to Monghyr, the Nawab sent Mir Abdullah and Ghu-
jam, Husain Khin (author of the Seuwr), who were intimate with Mr. Amyit, to
go and receive him, and to enquire into the object of his mission (See Ser,
Vol Il, p. 712). Mr, Amytt’s mission proved a failure (Sea Sar, Vol IT,
p. 742).

1 The Rryas’s account is not quite accurate What actually happened
ig detailed in the Seir, the author of which was an actor in these scenes.
(See Seir, Vol. If, p. 725), It appears that before the Council in Calcutta had
decided anything, on Mr. Amytt’s return, Mr. Amytt on his own responsibility
had written from Monghyr to Mr. Ellison, Chief of the Patna Factoty, to

slaughts, Nawab Qasim Ali Khan’s army triamphed,* and engaging

prepare for war, and the latter, without waiting for any declaration of war hy
the Council, quietly concentrated all the available English regiments in hia
Factory, and suddenly attacked the Fort at Patna The Nawib’s garrison
who were quite unprepared for such an attack, were surprised, and the
Fort fell partially into the hands of the English, whoge troops plandered the
houses in the Fort (See Sar, Vol. IT, p. 726). From Monghyr, reinforce.
ments were hurried up by the Nawab, and with these reinforcements Mir
Mehdi Khan, Nawib’s Deputy Subadar of Patna, vigorously assaulted the Fort,
recapinred it, also ca; tured the English Factory, when Mr. Ellison with Dr-
Falle.ton and other Enghehmen and their troops fied to Ohapra and thence to
the Sarju, when they were taken prisoners by the Bengalee Ram Nidhi, Fanjder
of Saran, and Sumroo the Frenchman, and bronght to Monghyr, where they
were thrown into prison. It was then (See Seir, Vol. II, p 727), that the
Nawab sent despatches to all his Faujdars and generals, apprising them of the
outbreak of hostilities between him and the English, and directing them to put
to the sword the English, wherever found, Mr. Amytt was killed at Murshi-
dabad, in pursuance of the above order (See Sew, Vol. II, p. 727). The Reyas’
statement that the Nawib fixed a ‘particular day’ for the massacre of the
English, or that he instructed his officers to kill Englishmen by treachery—
oes not accord with the Se:r’s version, which 1s more suthentic and reliable.

1 It is not clear to which battle the Riyaz refers here. As would appear
from the note ante, the first battle in which the Nawib’s army triumphed
was fought, in order to re-capture the Fort of Patna after the English had
suddenly surprised it. It does not appear from the Seir’s account that
on this victory, the Nawab slew “all the Englishmen,” but what he did was
that he apprised his officers of the outbreak of hostilities between him and
the English, and directed the former to put the English to the sword wher-
ever found. (See Se, Vol. I, p. 727), In pursuance of the above general
order, Mr, Amytt was put to the sword at Murshidaibid, aud the Qasimbazar
factory waa looted. (See Seir, Vol. II, pp 727-728). Then the English
Council assembled. in Calentta, and decided on war against the Nawab, and
also proclaimed Mir Jafar (who was in surveillance in Celontta) as the Nawib
Nazim of Bengal (See Seir, Vol. II, pp. 768-769). In the meantime, the
Nawab had directed his Fanjdar of Birbhum (Mubemmead Taqi Khan) to pre-
pare for fighting with the English, and had sent his officers, Jafar Khin,
Alam Khin and Shaikh Haibatu-l-lah with others to re-inforce Muhammad
Tagi Khin. The above three officers proceeded to Murshidabad, took ammu-
nitions and armaments from Syed Muhammad Khan, who was Depaty Nazim
of Murghidabad at the time, and encamped at Plassey and Katwah, whilst
Muhammad Taqi Khan. with his army, proceeded from Birbhum to Katwah.
(See Sesr, Vol. II, p. 728).

in capturing and killing slew all the English, and plundered their
factories. But Sadru-l-Haq Khan, Faujdar of Dinajptr, and the
Rajah of Bardwan held back their hands from this wretched work,

account ef these events is neither so detailed nor so lucid as that of the
Sevru-l-Mutakkerin, whose author Ghulam Husam Khin was an actor in, or
actual apectator of, most of these scenes. From the Sev, 1t appears that
after the re-capture of Patna, the next battle between the English and the
Nawib’s troops was fought at Katwah, The Nawib’s Faujdar of Birbhum,
Muhammad Taqi Khan, fought at this battle most gallantly, but his gallantry
was of no avail, as Syed Muhammad Khan, Deputy Nazim of Murshidabad,
failed, owing to jealousy that he bore, to support him, and prevénted Jafar
Khan, Alam Khin, and Shaikh Haibatn-l-lah also from re-inforomg him. (See
Seir, Vol. II, pp. 729 to 781), After this, the Engl ih with Mir Jafar entered
Morshidabid (Set, Vol. II, p 781). The news of the fall of his brave officers
Muhammad ‘I'sqi Khan, disconcerted the Nawab, who hurried up re-inforce-
ments under Sumioo, Malkar Armenian, and Asadallah, and directed them to
concentrate at Suti with the vanquished troops of Katwah. Major Adams
commanded the English army At the battle of Suti, the Nawab’s troops
were defeated, and the Enghsh won the victory (See Seir, Vol. II, pp.
782-788)

On heating of the defeat at Snti, the Nawab sent his Begame and children
to the fort of Rohtas, whilst he himself set out with his general, the Arme-
nian Gurgin Khin, to re-inforce is army that was now concentrated on the
banks of the Adbua nalla, a stream taking its rise from the hills north of
Rajmahal and flowing to the Ganges, This position waa considered to be of
strategic importance and impregnable, as 1b waa accessible by only one secret
passage. (See Sew, Vol. IZ, p. 784), On 24th Muharram in 1177 A.H., in
the night, the Nawib marched out from the Monghyr Fort. Suspecting trea«
chery from his officers as well as from his prigoners, and his suspicion bemg
fanned by the Armeman Gurgin Khin, the Nawib before leaving Monghyr
killed his prisoners, namely, Rajah Rimnirain, the guondam Naib Subadar of
Behar, Rajah Rijballab, the quondam Diwan of Nawab Shahamat Jang,
Rai Raian Umed Ram, Rajah Fateh Singh, Rajah Buniad Singh (zamindar of
Tikari), Shaikh Abdullah, as well as others, The Nawab caused Ramnarain
to he thrown into the river below Monghyr fort with a pitcher filled with
sand tied tohis neck. Gurgin Khan, not satisfied with this work of butchery,
meited the Nawab to kill also his English prisoners, consisting of Mr Hlison
and Dr. Fullerton and others of the Patna Factory. The Nawab, however,
refused to loll them and placed extra guard on them. Kamgor Khin Muin
also joined the Nawab, who was encamped at the Qhampanager nalla,
bub was sent away to Birbham by the traitor, Gnrgin Khin. (Ser, Vol.
II, p. 785). At this time, Mir Ruju-d-din, son of the late Nawab Saif
Khan of Purniah, deserted Mir Qisim’a army, proceeded to Parniah, and
made himself ite master, and opened correspondence with Mir Jafar Khan
and the Mnghah (Seir, Vol. II, p. 786), At Adhna, the Nawih’s troops

When Nawab Qasim Ali Khan made his entry into Monghyr,
he summoned to his presence all the officers of the Nizamat of

were wont for some time to sally ont in the night by the secret passage,
and to do havoc amongst Enghsh troops Once they went so far as
to attack Mir Jafar Khan’s Camp, Mir Jafar Khan having come to Adhna
with the Enghsh army. Mir Jafar was about to run away, when the
English army re-mforced him. The English were thrown into consternation
by these destructive mght-attacks, and were at a loss to find ont the passage
by which the Nawib’s troops approached the English entrenchments, At
this time, an English soldier who had long ago left the English army and
taken service under the Nawab, mformed the English army of the seoret
passage (Ser, Vol. II, p 787), and undertook to gmde them to the Nawab’s
entrenchments at Adhua With the help of this man, Colonel Goddard, with
an English 1egrment, moved to the Nawab’s entrenchment inthe night. The
Nawib's army were in a false sense of security, fancying the position impreg-
nable, and thinking that the seoret passage to 1t was unknown to the Enghsh.
The Nawab’s army under Asadullah Khin, the Frenchman Samroo, the
Ar.menians, Malkar and Antony, were surprised by this night-attack of
the Enghsh and defeated (Sen, Vol. II, p. 788), and dispersed on 26th
Safar,1177 A.H On the second or third day, the news of this disaster
reached the Nawab, who now moved tothe Monghyr Fort. After halting there
two or three days, he left that place with Gurgin Khin and others, placing
the Fort m charge of one Arab Ali Khin, a protege and creatute of Gurgin
Khan, and reached the Rohue zaila. At this time, a leading nobleman
named Ali Ibiahim Khan counselled the Nawib to release the English pri-
goners, named Messrs Eheon, Jee, and Lushington and others, or at least to
send their wives by boat to Major Adams. The Nawab referred Ali Ibrahim
Khin to Gurgin Khan, the A:menian evil genius of the Nawab. The Arme-
ninn said no boats were available, and refnsed to listen to the humane counsel
of All Ibrahim Khin On the way, Gurgin Khan was hacked to pieces with
the sword by some horseman, whose pay was in arrear. The Nawab moved
from Rohua nalla to Bah, where Jagat Set and his brother Sarupchand were
put to the sword unde: Nawab’s orders Fiom there the Nawab moved to
Patna, where he received news that Aiab Ali Khan, commandant of the
Monghyr Fort, and a creature of Guigin Khan, had accepted a bribe from the
Hinghsh, and treacherously made over the Fort to the latter. (Sez, Vol. 11,
p 741). The Nawab was exasperated, he was filled with suspicion, and his
annoyance knew no bounds, He ordered the Frenchman, Sumroo, to kill the
Enghsn prisoners, This Sumroo, though of one rehgion with the English
prigones, willingly accepted this murderous errand, and on the night of the
last day of Rabi-al-Awal, 1177 A.H., he shot down the English piusoners, who
were lodged at the tzme in the house of the late Haji Ahmad, brother of Maha-
bat Jang. That house has since become the Enghsh burial-ground in Patna,
(See Seir, Vol. II, p. 789). None escaped except Dr. Fullerton (Sew, Vol. 1,
p 740). The Nawab accused Dr. Fullerton of treachery, which the latter

Bengal, and set himself to the vork of administering the several

disavowed. The Nawib then spared lis life Dr. Fallerton snbsequently
escaped to Hajipur and joined the Enghsh army there (Setr, Vol. II, p 741)
The Enghsh next invaded Patna, and stormed the fort there (Sew, Vol TI,
p. 742). The Nawab now crossed the Karamnassa river, and entered the tern-
tory of Nawab-Vizier Shnjav-d-danlah (Sei, p. 743). The Nawab (Mir
Qasim) now met the Nawab-Vizer Shujau-d-daulah and the Emperor nenr
Allahabad, and induced them to help him m driving ont the English from
the Subahs of Behar and Bengal (Ser, Vol II, p 745) The Empeio., the
Nawab-Vizier and the Nawib now marched to Benaies wheie they encamped
for some time, in order to invade Behar (p 746 Sar) Dreading the approach
of the Nawab-Vizier Shujau-d-daulah, the Enghsh with Mir Jafar, who had
gone in pursnit of Mir Qasim, now retired from Baksa: towards Patna
Shnjau-d-daulah with his huge army and with Mir Qasim now overtook the
Bnghsh near Phulwari (p 749, Seer, Vol JI) There were skirmishes follow-
ed by a battle in which the Enghsh army reeled, bnt the result was indecisave,
owing to absence of concerted action between Mir Qasim and Shujau-d-daulah
(pp. 749-750, Seer, Vol II) At the same time, Mir Mehd: Khin, who had
before fought so bravely for Mir Qisim and re-captured the Patna Fort from
the Enghsh, now deserted his old master, Mir Qasim, and joined the Enghsh
(p. 750, Sevr, Vol. IT).

The Nawab. Vizier with Mir Qasim now retired to Baksar (Seir pp 751). At
this time, from the English side, Dr Fullerton used Ghulam Hngain Khan, tho
anthor of the Ser, as 2 spy, and wrote !7 him to induce the Emperor to give
his support tothe English, and to withhold his support of the Nawab-Vizer
(p. 751, Seir, Vol IT). Ghulam Husain Khan and Ins father Hedait Ali Khans
who held gagzs at Husainabad im Monghyr district, held a peculiar postion
at the time. They professed friendship both for Dr. Fullerton aud the Eng-
lish, and also for Mir Qasim and the Nawab-Vizier. They were all things to
all men, and enjoyed friendship and influence amongst both the hostile
parties. They opened secret correspondence with the Emperor, and induced
the latter to give his moral support to the English (p 751, Sew, Vol II), A
conference was now held between Ghulam Husain Khin who now played the
role of an English spy and between Major Carnac, Dr Fnilerton and Mir
Jafar, and a reply was sent through Ghulam Hossain Khiin and other spies
to the Emperor. In the meantime, Shujan-d-danlah fell ont with Mir Qasim
(p. 752). Mir Qasim now assumed the garb of a fagir, but was shortly
after induced to give it up, at the entreaties of Shujau-d-daulah who found
his honour was at stake. Shortly after, Mir Qasim’s French officer, Sumroo,
the infamous perpetrator of the Patna massacre, mutinied against Mir Qasim,
and was paid up and discharged by the latter. Then this mfamous Frenchman
took service under Shnujan-d-daulah with all the guns and ammunition of
his old master, Mir Qasim (p 755, Vol II, Ser). The Nawab-Vizier shame-
legaly imprisonet his rofagee Mi: Qasim ; all people deserted the latter, exerpt
his one old brave and loyal office:, Ali Ibrahim Khan, who clung to his old
master with & fdeliiy azcommc: im those treacherous daya. When Shujau-

d-daulab spoke ill of Mir Qasim, and wondered why Ali Ibrahim Khin clung
to Mir Qasim, in spite of the latter speaking ul of Ali Ibrahim, the latter
returned a manly and dignified answer which brought tears even to the eyes
of the mean Nawab-Vizier. Ali Ibrahom sad: ‘Tomy knowledge, I have not
been guilty of any dereliction m duty to my master (Mir Qasim), except
that after the events at Patna, whilst hs other officers counselled him to go to
the Dakhm, and secure support of the Mahrattas, I alone insisted on Mir
Qisim to seek shelter with you, the Nawib-Vizer, and with the Emperor!”
(p. 767, Vol. II, Sew.) At this time, Major Munro, commander of the English
army im Patns, wrote through Dr. Fullerton to Ghulam Husam Khin, the
author of the Serr, to use his influence in acquiring the Fort of Rohtas for
the Enghsh. Gholam Husain Khan tampered with Mir Qasim’s commandant
Rajah Sahmel, and induced the latter to make over the Fort of Rohtas to
Captam Goddard of the English army (p 758, Seir, Vol. II). Mir Jafar
now ietyrned to Murshidabad, where he died (Sewr, Vol II, pp 758 759),
on 14th §Shaban, 1178 Mir Jafar before setting out for Oalentta had left
his brother, Mir Mabammad Kamm Khan, sa Deputy Nazim of Patna, with
Dhiraj Narain (Rimnaiain’s brother) as Diwan under the latter. Mir Jafar
appointed Nendo Kumer as his Diwan (p 759, Ser, Vol. IT), and imprisoned
Muhammad Riza Khan, Deputy Nazim of Dacca (Jahangirnagar), who was
son-in-law of Rabia Begam and Ataullah Khan Sabat Jang. From fear of the
prestige and power of Shujau-d-daulah and from fear of the odium they
would incur by engaging in a war with the Emperor, both Mir Jafar and the
English seriously contemplated patching upn peace with the Nawab-Vizier
and the Emperor, leaving to them the Behar Provinces, and stipulating to
pay them a fixed revenue for Bengal (p 760, Vol. Il, Se}. This was, however,
not to be, owing to the Nawab-Viner’s ambition which would accept of no
compromise, but aimed at an exclusive domination over the whole Dmpire.
Whilst Mir Jafar was yet alive in Calcutta, Major Munro succeeded Major
Carnac m the command of the English ermy, and was ordered in Safar 1178
4 H., to proceed to Baksar to fight with the Nawab-Vizier Shujan-d-daulah ,
who was offenmve im his correspondence with the Enghsh Council in Calontta.

The Naw4b-Vizer and his army were mn a sense of false security and were
immersed in pleasures, frivolities and amusements, as if they had come for a
picnic On Major Munro’s arrival, the Nawab-Viner with is army hurriedly
took up a position on the north-west of ayhtl or marshy sheet of water. The
English army rested on the south-east of the jhil. The Nawab-Vizier posted
Sumroo and Madek with eight guns and, eight regiments of Mir Qasim to
cover his front The Nawab-Vizier’s army was composed of three wings.
The mgbt wing was commanded by the Nawab-Vizier hnmself, his centre was
commanded by Shuja Quali Khan with six thousand Mughal troops, and his
left wing was under the command of Rajah Beni Bahadur, Nawab-Vizier's
Deputy Subadar m Ondh and Allahabad The left flank of the left wing
rested on the banks of the Ganges The battle opened with a cannonade,
which was buskly kept up on both sides, and which did its destructive work

on both sides Then the Nawib-Vizer with his Mughal and Duraman troops
made a flanking sally from towards the nght of his own artillery, assaulted
Major Munro's cavalry and camp, and worked havoc in the English army.
From the brisk cannonade kept up by Madak and Samroo, and from the
repeated assdults of the Nawab-Vizer, the English army was hard-pressed
Major Munro grasping the crisis and finding a frontal attack impossible,
owing to the muddy jh lying am front of him, quickly detached a corps under
Captain Nan to make a flanking movement from the side of the river, in
order to attack the Nawab-Vizier's left wing, commanded by Rajah Beni
Bahadur This corps approached slowly, and reached the plain of the razas
amidst which Rajah Beni Bahadur’s troops lay Shaikh Ghulam Qadir and
other Shaikh Zadas of Lucknow who formed the van of Rajah Beni Bahadur’s
army, stood with guns hehind wall amidst those 1mns, The Haglish regi-
ments slowly and circumspectly, without disclosing themselves, crept up to
the summit of the wall, and 1t was only when they 1olled down stones on the
heads of the Rajsh’s troops that rested behind the wall at 1ts foot, that these
woke up from ther slumber It was only then that Shaikh Ghulam Qadir
and lus kmsmen and followers vame to know of the arrival of the Enghsh
regiment, aud roge upto tight Before, however, these Shaikhs could arrange
their force in fighting anay, the Knghsh regiment commenced firing their
muskets, and killed Ghulam Qadn and his Linsmen, whilst others fled At this
time, Rijah Bem Buhadur asked Ghahb Khan, a notable of Delhi, wha;
course he was to follow. Ghalio Khan answered that 2f the Rajah cared for
his honour, he must die fighting, 0. else must run away. Then for a time
the Rajah engaged in fightimg, but shortly after changing his mind, and pre-
fexxing not to die, ran away. In the meantime, hearmg the booming of
cannons by the Enghsh regiment on the heads of Shakh Ghulam Qadir and
Rajah Beni Bahadnr, Shuja Qui Khin’s jealousy was aroused, and fancymg
that the booming proceeded from the Riyah’s amy, and that the Rajah would
soon achieve the honour of a victory, without stopping to enquire into the
matter, he forthwith sallied out of his position, advanced across Samroo and
Muadak, who in consequence had to suspend their cannonade, and waded
across the yhtt fullof mud The Enghsh artillery from front now quickend
their cannonade, and Shuja Qui Khin and Ins soldiers uselessly sacrificed
thew hives, having lost the cover of their own artillery. The British regiment
now penetrated through the entrenchments of Rajah Bent Bahadur who had
fled, and atiacked jhe wing of the Nawab-Vizier, as the giound between was
already cleared by the foohsh aud disastrous forward movement of Shuya
Quh Khan. Then the Nawab-Vizier's army reeled and broke, the Nawab-
Viner himaelf stood the ground for some time, but seeing himself deserted by
his troops, retreated to Allahabad, whilst his Mughal and Duranian troops as
well as English troops, commenced plundering his tenta. Mir Qasim who
‘was a prisoner in the hands of the Nawab-Visier had been relensed one day
before this battle, and after the battle fled to Benares. (See Ser, Vol. IZ,
pp. 761-763).

sent a large army to Bengal. In the vicinity of R&jmahal, on the
banks of the iver Adhiiah, he reviewed his army, and sent des-
patches to the Fanjdars and the Deputy Nazim of Bengal, direct-
ing and instructing them peremptorily to fight with the English,
Amongst them, Shaikh Hidayitu-1-lah,? Deputy Faujdar of Nadiah
with a large army, Jafar Khan, and Alam Khan, Commandant ot
the Turkish bodyguaid of the Nawab, swiftly advanced to Katwah,
to fight. From the other side, the Enghsh army proclaiming
Nawab Jafar Ali Khan as Subadar of Bengal, and taking him in
their company advanced to fight, and ata distance of two kavoh
entrenched itself at Dainhat.8 On the 3rd of the month of Muhar-
ram, both the armies arraying themselves for battle kindled the
fire of warfare. The army of Qasim Ali Khan, after the fall of
a number of men whose moment for death had arnved, being de-
feated, fled to Palasi (Plassey) to Muhammad Taqi Khan, Faujdar
of Birbhiim. After two or three days, when the army of Bengal
had collected together, the English Generals arrived pursuing them.

This demmve victory af Baksar in 1764 (more than the battle of Plassey)
gave the Enghsh a firm foothold in Bengal, as a Ruling Power. It was soon
followed by the Emperor Shih Alam’s grant of the Dizoant of Bengal, Behar,
and Onissa to the Hnghsh in 1765 (See Seu, Vol. II, p 778).

The Engheh stipulated to pay annually twenty-four lakhs to the Bmperor on
account of the Revenue of the above three Snbahs

Muhammad Taqi Khan, with a large army, advanced to fight, bu
fell on being wounded with a gun-shot His army being defeated,
retired to Murshidabad. Syed Muhammad Khan, who held the
office of Deputy Nazim of Bengal after the departure of Mir
Turab Ali Khan for Monghyr, came out of the City of Murghi-
dabad with the troops at hand, and entrenched himself at Chona-
Chali. But when the news of the approach of the Enghsh army
arrived, his troops (many of whom had already receivedwounds in
their fightings with the English) without engaging in battle and
without firing their guns and muskets abandoned their entrench-
ments, and fled to Siti The army of Qasim Ali Khan arrived
at Sati, where Sumroo the Frenchman, with other Generals and
troops, was already from before. But the Hnaghsh not abandoning
their pursuit followed them up, and a great battle ensued at Siti
In that the star of Nawab Qasim Ali Khan’s luck was waning, and
the fortune of the Hoghish was 1n the ascendant, after severe fight-
ing, in this battle also the Enghsh triumphed The army of
Nawab Qasim Ali Khan, mable to stand the cannonade of the
English artillery, were defeated, and retired to the banks of the
Adhiah xalla, which was their camping ground from before.
There all the troops of the Nawab collected together, and renewed
fighting, At length, many of the Generals of Nawab Qasim Ali
Khan’s army, eluding Gurgin Khan, Commander of the Nawab’s
Artillery corps, as well as others, conspired with the English
The English, thus freed from anxiety, made a night-attack, and
broke the Nawab’s army, which fled. A severe defeat was thus
sustained by the Nawab. The defeated army -in a worsted con-
dition retreated to Monghyr. Nawab Qasim Ali Khan, on receiv-
ing news of this defeat, lost heart, and was thrown into consterna-
tion. In view of the disloyalty and treachery of the traitors who
had eften his salt, the Nawab felt himself unequal for a contest,
and abandoning all ideas of waifare he set out in an anxions
mood for Azima&bid The Nawab now killed Gurgin Khan on
account of his treachery, and also slew Jagat Set and his brother,
who were the plotters of this treacherous conspiracy, and who had
sent ont secret messages inviting Jafar Ali Khan and the Chris-
tian Hnglish, and whose treasonable correspondence had been
intercepted. The Nawab also killed other Zamindars, &c., who
from before were in prison, and each of whom was unrivalled in
his day for hatching, plots and intrigues, After arrival at

his Begams to the Fort of Rohtas, whilst he himself proceeded to
the Sabah of Oudh to the Vazirul-Mulk Nawab Shujau-d-daulah
Bahadur. There also he fell ont with the Nawab-Vizier, who
confiscated much of his treasures. From thence depaiting, the
Nawab retired to the hills, and in those tracts he hngered some
years in various mishaps, and at length died !

NIZAMAT FOR THE SECOND TIME OF JAFAR ALI
KHAN BAHADUR.

After Qasim Ali Khan’s defeat, the English Chiefs again placed
Nawab Jafar Ali Khan on the masnad of the Nizimat of Bengal.
Ten annas of the revenue of the Provinces were allotied to the
English for their service as Diwan, whilst six aunas of the same
were held by Nawab Jafar Ali Khin. This time also for a period
of three years, after displaying great feebleness in his Niz&mat,
m the year 1178 A.H., Nawab Jafar Ali Khan died. The Enghsh
Chiefs placed on the masnad of Nizimat his son, Najmu-d-daulah,*
and appointed Nawab Muhammad Riza Khan Bahddur Muzaffar
Jang to the office of Naib Nazim (Deputy Nazim). Najmn-d-daulah,
after suiting on the masnad of Niz&mat for two years, passed to
the regions of eternity. After Najmu-d-daulah’s death, his youn-
ger brothe:, Saifn-d-daulah® succeeded to the masnad of Niz&mat,
whilst Nawab Muzaffar Jang contmued to hold the office of Naib
Nazm. Saifu-d-daulah after holding the Nizimat for two
years died of small-pox; and another brother of his, Mubariku-

CHAPTER IV

DESORIBING THE DOMINATION OF THE ENGLISH
CHRISTIANS IN THE PROVINCES OF THE DAKHIN
AND BENGAL, AND CONTAINING TWO SECTIONS.

SECTION I.—DESCRIPTIVE OF THE ARRIVAL OF THE
PORTUGUESE AND FRENCH CHRISTIANS, &, IN
THE DAKHIN AND IN BENGAL.

Be it not hidden from the bright hearts of the bankers of the
treasure of History and the appraisers of the jewel of Chronicles,
that the Jewish and Christian communities, before the advent of
Tslam, used to come to many ports of the Dakhin, like Malabar,
&c, for trading purpose by the sea-1oute, and after acquirmg
familiarity with the people of that country, they settled down m
some of the towns, erected houses with gardens, and in this
manner dwelt there several long years When the planet of
the Muslim faith rose, and the bright effulgence of the Muslim
sun shone on the Hast and the West, gradually, the countries of
Hindustan and the Dakhin were recipient of the rays of the moon
of the Muhammadan faith, and Muslims commenced visiting those
countries Many of the kings and rolers of those parts embraced
the Islamic religion, whilst the Rajahs of the ports of Goa,
Dabil, and Jabil, c&c., like Muhammadan rulers, gave Musalman
emigrants from Arabia quarters on the sea-shores. and treated
them with honour and respect.! In consequence, the Jews and the

1 See Hunter’s History of British India, Vol. I, p. 29. Writes Dr. Hun-
ter: “The Saracen Arabs who under the conquering impulse of Islim next
seized the countries of the Indo-Syrian route (682-651 A.D.) soon realised its
value. They were «© trading not less than a fighting race, and Bussorah and
Baghdad under the Cahphs became the opulent headquarters of the Indian
trade.” The Saracens conquered Egypt, Syria, and Persia, 682-651 A.D. In

Christians burnt in the fire of envy and malice. And when the
Kingdoms of the Dakhin and Gujrat became subject to the Musal-
man Emperors of Dehli,! and Islim became powerful in the king-
dom of the Dakhin, the Jews and the Christians placed the seal of
silence on the door of their tongues, and ceased to utter words of
enmity and hatred. Subsequently in the year 900 A.H., weakness?
and decay set in in the kingdom of the Dakhin. At that time,
the Portuguese Christians, on behalf of the king of their own
country, were directed to build forts on the sea-shores of India.

an account of the Jewish trade with the Hast to an aiticleon ‘The Jews
under Rome’ by Lieut -Col Conder. Again says Dr. Hunter (p. 45): “The
trading colony of Arabs at Canton mcluded at the beginning of the 7th cen-
tury AD, an uncle of Mubammad the Prophet.” Again inp 46, says Dre
Honter: “It was ® commercial dispute that brought about the first Musal-
man conquest of an Indian Province In 711 A.D., Kasim led a naval ex-
pedition against Sindh, to claim damages for the ill-trontment of Arab mer-
chentmen and pilgrims near the mouth of the Indus in their voyage from
Ceylon. Dnring the following centuries the Indian Ocean became an ontly-
ing domain of Islam. The Arab geographers mapped the course from the
Persian Gulf to China into ‘seven seas,’ each having a name of its own, and
with the Arab-Chinese harbour of Gampuaon their eastern limit Abul eda,
the princely geographer of the fourteenth century (1273-1331) mentions
Malacca as the most important trading place between Arabia and China, the
common resort of Moslems, Persians, Hindus, and the Chinese Colonies of
Arabs and Jews settled in an early century of our era on the southern Bom.
bay coast, where their descendants form distinct communities at the present
day, The voyages of Sinbad the Sailor are a popular romance of the Indian
trade undér the Calphs of Baghdad, probably in the ninth century AD,”
From the above ut is clear that India, including Bengal, was within the sphere
of the commercial influence of the Saracen Arabs, from about the very dawn
of Islam.

1 The first Musalmiin conquests in the Dakhin were made in the reign of
Jallaln-d-din Khilji, Emperor of Delhi, through the military genius of his
nephew, Alan-d-din Khilji. See Tamkh-1-Firnz Shahi, p. 170, and n 2, ante,
p. 90.

3“In 1564, Vijayanegar finally went down before the Moslems in the
field of Talikot after an existence of 44) centuries. The Bahman: dynasty
formed from the coalition of the Musalmain adventnrers in the fourteenth
century, began to break up in 1489, and by 1525, its disintegration was com-
plete. The Portuguese arrived just as this once powerful kingdom was evolv-
ing itself through internecine war mto the Five Musalmian states of Southern
Tadia. At the time (1498, when Vasco da Gama landed in India) the Afghan
sovereigaty in Northern India was dwindling to a vanishing point.” See Dr.
Hunter's History of British India, Vol. I, pp. 101-102.

In the year 904 A.H., four ships of the Portuguese Christians!
came to the ports of Qandrinah # and Kalikot, and the Portuguese
after ascertaining thoroughly the state of affairs ® of the sea-board
sailed back. Ard the next year, six Portuguese ships arrived at
Kalikot,* and the Portuguese disembarked, and made a prayer to
the ruler of that place, who was called Samri, to prevent the Musal-
mans from trading with Arabia, urging that they (the Portuguese)
would yield him more profit than the Musalmans. The Samri did
not listen to their prayer, But the Christians commenced molesting
the Musalmans in mercantile business, so that the Samri § becom-
ing enraged ordered the former’s slaughter and massacre.
Seventy leading Christians were slain ; whilst the rest getting into
sloops sailed ont to save themselves, and alighted near the town
of Kuchin, * the ruter whereof was on terms of hostility with the

L Covilham, the first Portuguese explorer in India, stayed some time on the
Malabar coast (having come there from Aden on an Arsb ship), in 1487.
‘Vasoo da Gama reached Calicut on May 20th, 1498. See Dr. Hunter's His-
tory, Vol. 1, pp. 87-88.

8 The Earopean form of Qandrinah is, I guess, Conlon or Calicoulan. For
Conlon, Calicoulan, Cochin, Calicut, see the map at p. 96, of the above His-
tory. Ibn-i-Batuteh (1904-1377) mentions Quilon and Calicut amongst the
five chief ports that he had seen. See p. 48, n. 2 of the above History.

8 Dr. Hunter states that at the time the Malabar chiefs were tolerant of
the religions of the many nations who traded at their ports. Abu Zaid when
mentioning the foreign colonies records that the king allows each sect to fol-
low its own religion (Abu Zaida-l-Hasan of Siraf translated m Sir Henry
Elliot's History of India) ‘Manichaeans, Musalmins, Jews, and Christians
were alike welcome at the Malabar ports Not only Jews from the earher
times (from 6th century BC.) and ‘St. Thomas Christians,’ from 68 A.D.,
but sleo Arab traders (Moplahs) both in pre-Islamic and Islamic times were
geftled on the Malabar coasts. (See Dr. Hunter's History, Vol I, pp. 98-100).

# The Zamorin of Calicut received the Portuguese graciously. But the
foreign Arab merchants, then the most powerful community at his port, per-
ceived that the new ocean-route must amperil thew ancient monopoly by
way of the Red Sea, They accordingly instigated the court Officials to in-
trignes which nearly ended in atreacherous massacre, p. 103, Hunter’s History,

from the side of the Portuguese, who came with a c.usadig spirit. (See
p. 101, ibsd). yates

Samri. There they obtained permission to build a fort, and with-
in a short time they erected quickly a small fort, and dismantling a,
mosque which stood on the sea-shore they built on its site a
church.! And this was the first fort which the Christians erected
in India. In the meanwhile, the inhabitants of the port of
Kanor also leagued with them. The Christians erected a fort also
there. Bemg freed from anxiety, the Christians commenced a
trade in pepper and ginger, and obstructed* others from trading
therein. Consequently, the Samri advancing with his forces slew
the son of the king of Kughin, and ravaging that province returned,
The successors of the slain ruler collecting again a force raised
the standard of sovereignty, re-populated the province, and under
the advice of the Ferengis ® placed a flotilla of galleys in the
sea. And the ruler of Kanor also similarly fitted ont a flotilla of
boats. The Samri, getting enraged at this, bestowing all his
treasures on the army, twice or thrice advanced with his forces
apainst Kuchin* At every time, the Portuguese helped Kuchin,

1 In 1500 King Emmanuel of Portugal sent a fleet of thirteen ships under
Pedro Alvarez Caleral, who was well received by the Zamorin, and established
a factory on shore at Calicut for purchase of spices. He captured an Arab
vessel] and a Moslem vessel. The Arab merchants were roused to indig-
nation, and sacked the Portuguese factory at Calicut, slaying the chief agent
and fifty-three of his men. Calera! retaliated by burning ten Arab ships,

Caleral concluded a friendly treaty with the Rajab of Cochin, promising to
make him some day Zamorin of Calicut, and established a factory at Cochin.
Friendly overtures were also received by him from the Rajah of Quilon and
Cannanor. See Hunter’s History, Vol. I, p. 107. The fanatical vandalism

trast to the toleration and scrupulous regard for the sanctity of the Christian
Church shewn by the early Moslem Arabs under Omar, after the latter had
conquered Palestine and visited Jernsalem.—See Sir William Muir's ‘Annals

so that the Samri did not succeed in subduing it, and without
attaining his object retired. Becoming powerless, he sent envoys
to the rulers of Egypt, Jiddah, the Dakhin and Gujrat. Com-
plaining of the malpractices of the Christians, he asked for help,
aud sending out narratives of the oppressions practised by the
Christians over the Musalmans, he stirred up the vems of their
zeal and rage. At length, Sultan Qabsir Ghuri! despatched to the

barous cruelties, see Hanter’s History, Vol, I, pp. 109, 189, 140 and 141. Da

India under Alfonso de Albuquerque and his cousin Francisco de Albaquer-~
que, In India, the two Albuquerquss built a fort at Cochin, established a
factory at Quilon, and severely punished the Zamorin. Alfonso returned to
Insbon in 1504, whilst his consin was lost on his way home together with his
squadron.’ See Hunter's History, Vol I, p. 111.

continued the policy of unsparing destruction against the ports mm which
Arab influence prevailed ; laid part of Calicut in rains, and burned Cranganor:
Soarez broke the Arab supremacy on the Malabar coast. In 1505, King

Indian coasts a Genera], named Amir Husain, with a fleet of
thirteen war-vessels, containing a naval force with armaments.
Sultin Mahmid of Gujrat and Sultan Mahmid Bahmani of the
Dakhin also fitted out numerous ships from the ports of Deo,
Sirat, Kolah, Dabil and Jabal, in order to fight with the Portu-
guese. Furst, the ships from Egypt arrived in the port of Deo,
and uniting with the ships of Gujrat set out for Jabal, which was
the rendezvous of the Portuguese. And some ships of the Samri
and some ships of Goa and Dabil having also joined them, they
kindled the fire of war; but suddenly, one warship full of the
Portuguese quietly sailed up from the rear. The Portuguese
commenced a cannonade, and converted the sea into a zone of
fire. Malik Ayaz, ruler of Deo, and Amir Husain were obliged to
fight with them, but failed to effect anything. Some Egyptian
galleys were captured, and the Musalmans drank the potion of
martyrdom, whilst the Portuguese triumphantly steered back to
their own ports. Inasmuch as at that period, Sultan Salim,
Khaqan'! of Ram (Turkey), defeated the Ghoriah Sultaén* of
Egypt, and the empire of the latter came to an end, the Samri
who was the promoter of this war lost heart, and the Portuguese
acquired complete domination. In the month of Ramzan, 915
A.H., the Portuguese proceeded to Kalikot, set fire to the Cathe-
dral Mosque, and swept the town with the broom of plunder. But
on the following day, the Malebaiese collecting together attacked

imperishable glory. In 1509, Almeida, the senior, defeated the combined
Moslem fleets off Diu, and slew 3,000 of their men. The aggressions of the
‘urks upon Egypt gave the Mamelake Sultin, of Cairo, work nearer home,
and disabled him from sending further expeditions to India.

(The Turks wrested Egypt from the Mameluke Sultan in 1517].

Almeida’s victory over Moslems off Diu on February 2nd, 1509, secured to
Christendom the Naval supremacy in Asia, and turned the Indian Ocean for
the next ceninry into a Portnguese sea.” See Hunter's History of British
India, Vol. 1, pp. 127-118.

“The first five years of annunl expeditions from 1500 to 1508 had given the
Portuguese the upper hand in the armed commerce of the Malabar coast,
The following four years under Almeida (1505-1509) left them masters of the

the Christians, killed five hundred leading Portuguese, and
drowned many of them in the sea. Those who escaped the sword
fled to the port of Kolam,! and intriguing with the Chief of that
place, at a distance of half a farsakh from that town, erected a
small fort, and entrenched themselves there. And in the same
year, they *wrested the fort of Gonh from the possession of Yusaf
Adil Shah ;8 but the latter shortly after amicably got it back from
their hands. But after a short period, the Portuguese offering
a large sum of money to the ruler of that place 1e-acquired
possession of it, and establishing their Capital at that port, which
was very strong, fortified it further, And the Samri, from the
humiliation and sorrow consequent on this, died in the year 921
A.H., and his brother succéeding him ceased hostility, and estab-
lishing peaceful relations with the Portuguese, gave the latter
permission to erect a fort near the town of Kalikot, obtaining from
them a stipulation to the effect that he would send yearly four
ships of pepper and ginger to the ports of Arabia. For a short
while, the Portuguese kept their promise and word, bat when
the fort was completed, they prevented his trading in the afore-
said articles, and commenced various malpratices and oppressions
on the Musalmans. And similarly, the Jews who were at Ka-
datklor,* being informed of the weakness of the Samri, trans-
gressed the limits of propriety, and caused many Musalmdus to
drink the syrup of martyrdom. The Samri, repenting of his past
policy, first proceeded to Kadatklor, and completely extinguished

the Jews, so that no trace of them remained there. After this,
with the support of all the Musalmins of Malabar, he advanced
to Kalikot, besieged the fort of the Portuguese, and fighting
bravely defeated the latter, and stormed their fort. In conse-
quence, the power and prestige of the Malabarese Musalmans
grew, and without any pass from the Portuguese they despatched
on their own behalf vessels loaded with pepper and ginger to
the ports of Arabia. In the year 938 A.H, the Portuguese erect-
ed a fort at Jaliat, which 1s six karoh from Kalikot, and the pas-
sage of ships from Malabar was thereby rendered difficult.
Similarly, the Christians! in those years, during the reign of
Buthin Nizim Shah, erecting a fort at Raikiindah close tothe port
of Jabil, settled down there. In the year 943 A.H , erecting a fort
also at Kadatklor, the Christians acquired much power. At this
time, Sultan Sulaimin, son of Sultan Salim of Turkey,’ planned

Eastern Roman Empire, is still known amongst Musalmins in India as ‘Rim.

that station and tried to outflank it by menacing the Portuguese factories

the Red Sea, they were often repulsed, and their momentary successes at
Aden ended in lasting falore. In vam the Lisbon Court tmed to make a few
years’ arrangement with the Turks, offermg in 1541 to supply pepper in

possession thereof himself, Accordingly, in the year 944 A.H., he
Sent his. Vazir, Sulaiman Pasha, with a fleet of one hundred war-
ships to the port of Aden, in order to take 16 first, as it formed the
key to the maritime position of India, and then to proceed to the
ports of India. Sulaiman Pasha in that year wresting the port of
Aden from Shaikh Daud, and slaying the latter, sailed out for the
port of Deo, and commenced warfare. He had nearly stormed it,
when his provisions and treasures ran short. Therefore, without
accomplishing his mission, he sailed back to Turkey. And in the
year 963 A.H., the Portuguese became dominant over the ports of
Harmiz! and Muscat, over Sumatra, Malacea,* Milafor, Nak,
Fatan, Nashkiir, Ceylon, and over Bengal to the confines of
China, and laid the foundations of forts at many places. But
Sultén Ali Akhi stormed the fort of Sumatra; and the ruler of
Ceylon also defeating the Portuguese, put a stop to their molesta-
tion over his country. And the Samri, ruler of Kalikot, being
hard-pressed, sent envoys to Ali Adil Shah, and persuaded the
latter to fight with the Portuguese, and to expel them from his
kingdom. And in the year 979 A.H.,” the Samri besieged and

Christians, adoptiny a settled policy! of molesting and oppress-
ing the Musalmans, perpetrated much highhandedness. Whilst
some ships of Emperor Jalalu-d-din Muhammad Akbar, which
without a pass from the Portuguese had procedéded to Makkah,
were returning from the port of Jiddah, they looted them,
and inflicted various molestations and humiliations on the Musal-
mans, and set fire to the ports of Adilabad and Farabin which
belonged to Adil Shah, and ravaged them completely. And com-
ing under the guise of traders to the port of Dabil, the Portu-
guese schemed by means of fraud and treachery to get hold of it
also. But the Governor of that place, Khwajah Aliu-l-Mulk, a
merchant of Shiraz, becoming apprised of their intention, killed one
hundred and fifty principal Portuguese, and quenched the fire of
their disturbance.

SECTION II.—DESCRIPTIVE OF THE DOMINATION OF
THE ENGLISH CHRISTIANS OVER THE DOMINIONS
OF BENGAL, AND THE DAKHIN, &o.

Be it known to the minds of enlightened researthers, that from
the date that the ships of Jalilu-d-din Muhammad Akbar Pad-
shah’ were captured at the hands of the Portuguese Christians, the
sending of ships to the ports of Arabia and Ajam was totally
suspended, inasmuch as the Emperor viewed the acceptance of
passes from the Portuguese to be derogatory, whilst to send the
ships without such passes was attended with danger to the
lives of passengers, and with peril to their property. But the
Emperor’s Umaré, like Nawab Abdu-r-Rahim Khan Khan-i-

1 “yom the time of Albuquerque the inexorable issue between Catholicism
and Islam in Asia stands forth. Each side firmly believed itself fight-
ing the battles of its God. ‘I trast in the passion of Jesus Christ in whom
I place all confidence,’ Albuquerque declared in 16507 before entering on his
governorship, ‘to break the spirit of the Moors (Musalmians).’ ‘ We desire
nought else but to be close to God’ ran the Moslem summons in 1589. It
denounced the aggressions ‘of the Christians of Portugal,’ and warned an
Indian prince that 1f he held back, his sonl would descend into hell.’ (Sulai-
man Pashii to the ruler of Cambay, May 7th, 1539.) See Hunter's History,

Khanan! &c., taking passes from the Portuguese Christians,
sent out ships to the ports. And for some time the state of
things continued in this wise. When Emperor Nuru-d-din Mu.
hammad Jahangir ascended the throne of Dehli, he permitted the
English Christians, who, in their articles of faith, totally differ
from the Christian Portuguese and the Christian French, é&c , and
who thirst for the latter’s blood, and are in hostility with the
latter, to settle down in the tract of Surat,? which pertained to the
Province of Gujrit.8 This was the first place amongst the Indian
sea-ports, where the English Christians settled down. Before
this, the English Christians used to bring their trading ships to

1 Abdur Rahm, Khin-1-Khanan, was son of Bairam Khan, and was
born at Lahore, 964A.H. In 984, he was appomted to Gujrat He conquered
for Akbar Gujrit, and defeated Sultin Muzaffar, King of Gujrat, at the
battle of Sarkij. His great deeds were the conquests of Gujrat and Sindh,
and the defeat of Suhail Khan of Bijapur. (See Blochamann’s Translation
of Ai-i-Akbari, Vol. I, p. 384).

® In 1607 Captain Wilham Hawkins landed at Surat with a letter from
James I. to the Mughal Emperor (Emperor Jahangir reigned 1605-1627), and
proceeded to the Court at Agra. In 1611 Sir Henry Middleton landed at
Swally. In 1612 Captain Best routed the Portuguese squadron near Surat,
and obtained congratulations of the Mughal Governor, who allowed the
English to settle at Surat in 1613. Downton's sea ight in 1615 established
English supremacy over the Portuguese. In 1616, Sir Thomas Roe wad sent
by James I. to be ‘ambassador to the Great Mognl.’ Surat was the chief
stating place for Mecca, and the Portuguese squadron had troubled the ocean
path of pilgrimage. The Imperial Court, too happy that one infidel fleet
should destroy another, granted to Sir Thomas Roe an ‘order’ for trade,
Roe obtained a ‘ permit’ in 1616 for the English to reside at Surat and to
travel freely into the interior, and also a similar ‘grant’ 1n 1618 from Prince
Khurram (afterwards Hmperor Shih Jahan) who was then Mughal Viceroy
of Gojrat, The Hoglish by their good conduct gradually acquired the posi-
tion of a useful sea-police, and as patrol of the Moslem pilgrim-ocean-rante ,
and as a ‘sure source of revenue,’ under the Great Mughal. In 1657 the Eng-
ish Company decided that there should be one ‘ presidency ’ in India, that
being at Surat. See Hunter's History of British India, Vol. II, Chap II.

8 Akbar conquered and re-conquered Gujrat and the province on the shore
of the Gulf of Cambay between 1672-1692; and theso were finally ahnexed
to the Mughal Empire in 1598. Surat was the Oapital of Gujrat ond the
Chief Mughal port on the western coast for the embarkation of pilgrims to

tra which included not only Gajrat but part of Kathiwar. See Dr.

the ports of India, and after sale of their cargoes used to sail back
to their own country. After they settled down at Surat, the
trading factories of the English Christians, like those of the
Christian Portuguese and the French, &c., gradually sprang up at
different centres both in the Dakhin! and in Bengal,? and they paid

! For the first English settlements on the Madras Coast (1611-1658), see Dr
Hunter’s History of British India, Vol. IJ, Chap III Ther first settlement
under Captain Hippen on that coast was in 1611 at Masulipatam, the chief
sea-port of the Moslem Golconda Kingdom (founded in 1612 under Kutab
Shahi line on the breaking-up of the Musalman Bahmani Dynasty, and not
subdued by the Mughal Hmpire until 1687). In 1682, the English recerved
the ‘ Golden Phermaund’ (farman) of the Golconda King for their settlement
at Masulpatam In 1689, the English under Francis Day built a factory at
Madras. In 1645, the Moslem King of Golconda confirmed the grant of
Madras for an English settlement. In 1653, Madras was tejsed to an indepen-
dent ‘ presidency,’ and in 1658, the Enghsh Oompany declared all its settle-
ments in Bengal and the Coromandel Coast subordinate to Fort St Geoge.

% For an account of the Enghsh settlements x Bengal (bet 2en 1683-1658),
see Hunter's History of ‘British India,* Vol. II, Chap. IV, and Wileon’s
‘Early Annals of the Huglish m Bengal,’ Vol I,

In 1682, by order of Mimperor Shah Jahan, Qasim Khan destroyed the Por-
tuguege settlement at Hugli, and expelled the Portuguese whu had been ill-
treatmg the Moslems. The English Company’s agent at tie Masulipatam fac-
tory seized the occasion, and sent out in 1688, on a country oat, eght Eng-
hshmen to try and open up trade with the fertile provinces it the month of
the Ganges. These headed by Ralph Cartwright reached Harishpur in Orissa,
and then quietly crept up to the court of Malcandy, m Foit Barabati, in
Outtack, where remded a Mughal Deputy-Governor for Orissa, named Agha
Muhammad Zaman This polite Peisian—the Deputy-Governa: of Orissa—
‘received the Enghshmen in his Andience-hall, affably inclined bis head to
Mr Cartwright, then shpping of his sandal offered his foot to the English
merchant to kiss, which he twice refused to do, but at last was fam to do it.’
(Hunter’s History, Vol. II, p. 89). The Deputy-Governor on May 5th, 1633,
sealed an order giving the English ample license to trade (See text of order
in Wilson’s Barly Annals of the English in Bengal, Vol. I, pp. 11-12). The
beginning of the English trade with Orissa is usually ascribed to a farman
granted to the Hnghsh in 1634 by Emperor Shah Jahan, confining them to
Pipph near an old mouth of the Subarnarukha mver On May 6th, 1633, the
English but a bhonse of business at Hariharpur; near Jagatsingpur iu the
Cuttack district, this being the first English factory in the present Lieutenant-
Governorship of Bengal. InJune, 1633, Cartwright fonnded a factory at
Balasore. In 1650, the Buglish founded a factory at Hugli. Gabriel Bough-
tou, au Euglish Surgeou, who was in 1650 Surgeon to Shib Shuja (Mughal

customs-duties like others. During the reign of Emperor Aurang-
zeb Alamgir, the English rendered loyal services to the Emperor,
and were, therefore, granted an Imperial Farman,! permitting them
to erect trading factories in the Imperial dominions generally, and
in Bengal especially, and also remitting customs-duties on the
ships of the Enghsh Company, in consideration of an annual
payment by the latter of three thousand rupees, as has already
been mentioned in connection with the foundation of Calcutta.
From that time, the English acquired much prestige in Bengal.
In the year 1162 A. , Nawab Muzaffar Jang, maternal grand-
son of Niz&mu-l-Mulk Agaf Jah, at the instigation of Husain
Dost alias Chand, who was one of the leading men of Arkat
(Arcot), allied himself with the Christian French, and attacked
Anwaru-d-din Khan Shahimat Jang Gopamani, who was Nazim
of Arkat from the time of Nawab Nizg&imu-l-Mulk Agaf Jah, in
order to wrest the province of Arkat. A great battle was fought,
and Nawab Shahamat Jang, on the battle-field, displaying bravery
aud heroism, was killed. Nawab Nizimu-d-daulah, second son
of Nawab Agaf Jah, who, on the death of his father, had suc-
ceeded to the masnad of the Viceroyalty of. the Dakhin, on hear-
ing of the hostility of his maternal nephew, with a force of
seventy thousand cavalry and one hundred thousand infantry, set
out to chastise Muzaffar Jang. Arriving at the port of Bilchari
(Pondichery) on the 26th Rabiu-l-awal 1163 A.H., Nizamu-d-
daulah fought a battle, in which he triumphed, whilst Mugaffar
Jang was captured. Nizimu-d-daulah spent the rainy season at
Arkat. The Christians of Bilchari (Pondichery) conspired with
Himmat Khan and other Afghan generals of Karnatik, who were
servants of Niz&ému-d-daulah, and deceiving them by holding out
temptations of lands aud treasures, blinded their sense of obliga-

a ‘nishan’ or ‘ permit’ from Shah Shuja to trade duty-free in Bengal on pay-
ment of Rs. 3,000.

1 His Majesty Hmperor Aurangzeb on 27th February, 1690, granted a far-
manto the Hnglish. The farman sets forth that ‘all the Hnglish having made
a most humble, submissive petition that the ill-orimes they have done may be
pardoned,’ and promised to pay a fine of Rs 150,000, to restore all plundered
goods and behave themselves no more in such # sharneful manner, the Em-
perot accepts their submission and grants them a new license for trade, on
condition that ‘Mr. Ohild, who did the disgrace, be turned out and expelled.’

tions. Those traitors tied up the waist of mutiny and treachery,
and conspiring with the Christians of Bilchari (Pondichery),
on the night of the sixteenth Muharram, 1174 A.H., delivered a
night-attack, and killed Nawab Nigimu-d-daulah. After the fall
of Nawab Nigimu-d-daulah, the Afghans and the Christians (the
French) placed Nawab Muzaffar Jang on the masnad. Mugaffar
Jang proceeded to Biilchari (Pondichery) with a contingent of the
Afghins, and taking a large number of Christian French in his
service made them his confidants. In the same year, taking a
large force cousisting of Afghans and Christians, he set out for
Haidarabad, and crossing the confines of Arkat came to the Af-
ghin tract. From the vicissitude of fortune, hostility broke out
between Muzatfar Jang and the Afghans, and it led to a fight.
On the 17th Rebiu-l-aw4l of the aforesaid year, both sides ar.
ranged themselves in battle-array. On one side were arrayed
Muzaffar Jang and the Christian French, and on the other the
Afghans. Himmat Khén and other Afghan Generals, meeting
with their deserts for disloyalty, were killed, whilst Mugaffar
Jang from an arrow-shot which pierced the pupil of his eye
was also killed. After this, the Christian French entered the
service of Amiru-l-Mumalik Salibat Jang, third son of Asaf
Jah, received as jagire Sikakil and Rajbandari, é&c., and acquired
so much influence, that their orders became current in the Dakhin.
No Musalman ruler had before this taken into employ the Christian
French, though froma long period they used to frequent the ports of
the Dakhin. It was Mugaffar Jang who taking the Christian French
into his service, introduced them into the Moslem dominions,
When the Christian French acquired so much influence, the
Christian English, who thirsted for the blood of the French, also
cherished ambition to meddle with the Imperial dominions, acquir-
ed possession of some tracts in the Dakhin, brought the fort of
Sarat into their own possession, and established fortified fac-
tories in Bengal. In that the French slaying Nawab Anwara-d-
din Khan Gopamani, the Sibahdar of Arkat, and nominally
installing another person at its head, had become dominant in the
Dakhin, Nawab Muhammad Ali Khan, son of Nawab Anwaru-d-din
Khan, entered antoan alhance with the English Chiefs. The latter
advancing to the assistance of Nawab Muhammad Ali Khan spared
no measure to help him, and exerted themselves strenuonsly to
exterminate the French. In 1174 AH, the English besieged

the fort of Bilchari (Pondichery), and wresting it from the hands
of the French rased it, whilst Sikakil, Rajbandari, and other
Jagirs were unexpectedly abandoned by the French, Nawab
Muhammad Ali Khan, with the support of the English, succeeded
his father on the throne of the Viceioyalty of Arkat (Arcot),
under the surname of Walajah Amiru-l-Hind Muhammad Ali Khan
Mangir Jang, subordinated himself to the English Chiefs, and
passed his life in ease and pleasure. Now the province of Arkat
(Areot), like Bengal, is under the domination of the Enghsh
Chiefs. .

And as has been related before, when Nawab Siraju-d-daulah,
Nazim of Bengal, owing to his inexperience, flung the stone into
the hornet’s nest, he suffered of necessity the sting. And Nawab
Jafar Ali Khan, treating the English as his confidants and collea-
gues in the Nizémat of Bengal, suffered them to acquire control
over administrative affairs. Inasmuch as complete disintegration
had overtaken the Moslem Empire of Delhi, in every Sibah the
Provinc‘al Governors acquiring authority grew into semi-inde-
pendent Feudatories. Now, since a period of thirty years, the Pro-
vinces of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa have come into the possession
and authority of the English Chiefs. An English Chief, styled
the Governor-General, coming from England, resides in Cal.
cutta, and selecting Deputies for the collection of the revenue
and for administration of civil and criminal justice, and for trad-
ing business, sends them out to every place. And establishing
the Khalisah Kachiri! (the Court of Crown-lands) in Calcutta, the
English Governor settles on his own behalf the assessment of the
revenue of each Zila (District), And the Deputies and the
Ziladirs (District Officers) collecting ‘revenues, remit them to
Calcutta.

In the year 1178 A.H., when the English became victorious? over
Nawab Vazirn-l-Mulk Shujau-d-daulah, Nazim of the Siibah of
Audh and Mahibad (Allahabad), a treaty was eutered into, and the
English left to the Nawab Vazir his country. From that time, they
have acquired influence over that Sibah also, and seizing the district
of Banaras have separated it from that Siibah. And their soldiers
quartering themselves in the dominions of the Nawab-Vazir, as the

latter’s servants, exercise influence over ait aifairs. Heaven knows
what would be the eventual upshot of this state of things.

Similarly, in the Dakhin, the English have got in the fort of
Madras an old factory and a large army. They have also ac-
quired possession of the Province of Arkat They hold, as jagins
under Nizim Ali Khan, the towns of Ganjam, Barampur, Ichaptr;
Sikakil, Ishdqpatan, the fort of Qasim kotah, Rajbandar, Ilor
(ElNore), Machlibandar (Masullipatam), Bajwarah, and the fort of
Kondbali, &c., and the Zamindars of those places appearing before
them pay m 1evenue And whenever Nizim Ali Khan needs
auxiliaries, they furnish him with strong contingents, and out~
wardly do not disobey his orders.

But the English Christians! are embellished with the ornaments
of wisdom and tact, and adorned with the garments of considerate-
ness and courtesy. They ar. matchless in the firmness of their re.
solutions, in the perfectness of their alertness, in the organisation
of battles, and in the arrangement of feasts, They are also
unrivalled in their laws for the administration of justice, for the
safety of their subjects, for extermination of tyranny, and for
protection of the weak. Their adherence to their promises 1s so
great that even if they risk their lives, they do not deviate from
their words, nor do they admit liars to their society. They are
liberal, faithful, forbearing, and honourable. They have not
jearnt the letters of deceit, nor have they read the book of crooked-
ness. And notwithstanding their difference in creed, they do not
interfere with the faith, laws, and religion of Musalmans.

All wranglings between Christianity and Islam, after all, lead
to the same place :

The dream (of empire) is one and the same, only its interpreta-

tions vary.

1 The author of the Riyaz appears to be remarkably liberal and catholic
in his views, as the conclading lines of his History would indicate Compare
this picture of the ‘new English rulers’ with that in the Seir-ul-Mutakkerim.
