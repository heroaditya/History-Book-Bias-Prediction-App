PREFACE

It is with full consciousness of its manifold defects that J present
this work to.the students of Persian literature. Khusrau’s name has
always been-a household word in India, and most of us must have
become familiar with it in their earliest childhood through his Hindi songs
and conundrums. To many of us may have come the urge to know him
more intimately. With me it had been a passion from an early age to
learn all I could about his romantic personality, and when in 1927 I got
@ Punjab Government scholarship for study abroad, I eagerly availed
myself of the opportunity thus afforded and proceeded to utilize the
rich collection of his works in the various libraries in London in my
search for details of his chequered life and multifarious activities.

A good deal had, no doubt, been already written on Khusrau,
especially in Urdu, and Prof. Habib of the Aligarh University had
contributed a long and learned article in English to the Aligarh
Magazine which was later published in book form under the title of
‘The Life and Works of Hazrat Amir Khusrau’. But I felt that there
was still a good deal of scope for a scientific study of this poet, and if
my readers think that I have been successful in throwing new and
enhanced light on the subject and in giving them a few facts of history
that they could not readily find elsewhere, my labours would be amply
rewarded. These facts, it will be noticed, have mostly been gleaned
from the poet’s own writings.

The work was submitted and approved for the Ph.D. degree of the
London University in 1929. Since then it lay unnoticed and could not
be published on account of vavious difficulties, mainly financial. The
Punjab University Oriental Publications Fund Committee, however,
came gallantly to my rescue and kindly agreed to defray the expenses
of publication from the funds at its disposal. In this connection my
grateful.thanks are especially due to Prof. Mohammad Shafi of the
Punjab University who brought the work to the notice of the members
of this Committee. I am also indebted to him for several useful
suggestions.

I must likewise acknowledge gratefully the help and guidance I
received from my learned tutor, Sir E. Denison Ross, and must not
forget to thank Miss M. Browne, Miss E. Beavis, and others connected
with the School of Oriental Studies, as well as my friends and fellow-
students in London, especially Drs. Hem Chandar Rai, R. 8. Tripathi,
Zubaid Ahmed, and Saeed Hasan for their pleasant and inspiring
company. .

It would be well to add here a few words about the transliteration
of Arabic and Persian words in this work. The system used is the
same as that employed in most standard works on Oriental subjects,
except in the case of a few words that have been spelt according to
their accepted and familiar forms in English, e.g. the Koran, Sheikh,
Leyla, Kaiqobid, etc. Rare cases of irregularity may be noticed
in spite of a very careful revision, and for these I crave the reader’s
indulgence. Place-names, unless very unfamiliar, have not been supplied
with any diacritical marks. The following table would explain how
some of the Arabic and Persian letters have been denoted :—S=t, &=

b=2, ¢=(‘), ¢=gh, S=q,-=h. No special sign has been used to
indicate the letter .” (.- ).

I have tried to make the index as useful as possible but have
omitted most of the geographical names. A few important names have
only been included.

INTRODUCTION

THE DEVELOPMENT OF PERSIAN POETRY IN INDIA
BEFORE THE TIME OF KHUSRAU

Persian poetry produced in India has always been looked upon by
modern scholars with mild contempt. They consider it to be a counter-
feit, a spurious imitation of the genuine products of Shiraz and Ispahan,?
and consequently it has never received the attentions so lavishly bestowed
upon the poetry of Persia. Yet, it is a fact that India has produced
almost as large a number of Persian poets as Persia herself, and that
some of them have left as deep an impress upon Persian literature in
general as any poet of the sister-country. Whatever one may say,
moreover, about the poetry of later times, it is fallacious to assume that
there could be any essential difference in the language or spirit of the
early poetry produced in Ganja, Shiréz or Nishapur on the one hand
and Lahore or Delhi on the other, for ever since the Ghaznavid conquest
of northern India all these places formed a united whole and the geo-
graphical distinctions of the present day did not exist at all. Persia,
as we know her to-day, is a much later creation.

When the Ghaznavids established themselves in India in the eleventh
century, Lahore became an important centre, politically as well as
socially equal to Ghazna itself, and there was a free and profuse inter-
course between the different parts of Persia, Afghanistan, Transoxiana,
Khorasan, and the Punjab, and the literary language was bound to be
the same in all these places. This language, of course, was Persian.
Nobles and scholars migrated to the conquered territory, settled down
there; temporarily or permanently, and laid the first foundations of the
Indo-Persian culture that was to find its highest perfection in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries in the time of the great Moghuls, and, naturally,
these early settlers were the first to produce Persian poetry in India.

To trace, then, the origin of Persian verse in India, we must turn
to this age. Unfortunately, very little of the literature of that period
has been preserved, and, except in the case of one or two poets, all
that has been left of its poetry is in the form of laconic extracts available
in some histories and biographies. Among the earliest poets the most
outstanding names are those of the two contemporaries, Abul Faraj
Riiyani (or Riini) and Mas‘id-i-S‘ad.

1 Thus Browne says : ‘ This Persian literature produced in India, has not, as a
rule, the real Persian flavour, the blar as the Irish call it, which belongs to the:
indigenous product,’ (Pers. Lit. under the Tartar Dom., p. 107.):


--- Page 16 ---
pi

The former, according to Badaoni,) was born in Riyan, a village
near Lahore, while according to another version his native place was
Rina,” a suburb of Nish&pur, but there is no doubt that he lived most
of his life in or about Lahore, which, according to al-‘Awfi, was in
those days the proudest of all districts ‘in its unlimited learning and
scholarship ’.2 He is said to have left behind him a diwin of qasidas
comprising two thousand ‘baits’, most of the poems being in praise
of his royal patron Sultan Ibrahim bin Mas‘id.‘ Anwartl, it is said,
had with him always a copy of his diwin, and imitated his style. A
jealous rivalry between him and Mas‘id-i-S‘ad led to the latter’s con-
finement for ten years in the fortresses of Si, Dhak, and Nay.®

" Ma‘siid-i-S‘ad was certainly a greater poet than his rival, and
according to an old tradition left three diwins, one each in Arabic,
Persian, and Hindi. He was born and brought up in Lahore, for which
city he contracted a deep and affectionate attachment.’ His Persian
diw&n is the only one of the three that has survived, and shows that
even in those early days the poetry of India had reached a very high
level. Some of his poems, written in his captivity, are full of deep
and stirring pathos. One very fine poem describes his separation from
his wife on the occasion of his departure on a journey, and is an
exquisite piece of lyrical poetry, rarely equalled in excellence by any
Persian poem.®

After these two we have a long gap, and it is only in the time of
Shamsuddin Iltitmish that we read’ of another notable poet, Amir
Rihinf. Little, however, is known, about him, except that he came to
Delhi from Bukbara during the Mongol upheaval, and composed qasidas
in praise of Shamsuddin.® But his successor, Shihab-i-Muhmira or
Mutmira,!° who lived in the time of Ruknuddin bin IItiitmish, is better
known. He belonged to Badaon or Madarén and was recognized to be
Maaqila, p. 142.

“8 Lubbul-albab, IT, 241.

4 A copy of his diwadn (about 60 foll.) exists in the Brit. M. Library. It
comprises qasidas and a few quatrains. Most of the qasidas are in praise of Sultan
Mas‘id b. Ibrahim (d. 508 3.)

5 He was involved in a conspiracy formed by the son of the king. See Chahar
Maqala (pp. 140-145) for a brief biographical sketch.

a master by Fakbr-ul-Mulk ‘Amid al-Ninki (?), who was himself an
elegant poet. Specimens of his poetry are preserved in various bio-
graphies and Khusrau himself imitated some of his poems.’ It was,
in fact, due to the great fame and renown of Khusrau that so little is
known of his poetry, for, in the words of Badaoni, ‘ after the appearance
of the ensign of the king of poets, the poetry of his predecessors became
bedimmed like stars at the rise of the sun’.?

Shamsuddin Dabir, who later became one of the patrons of Kbusrau,
was the foremost of the poets in Nasiruddin Mahmiid’s court. He was
a great scholar also, and held a high position in the time of Mahmid’s
successor Balban, who appointed him the ‘ munshi’ of the province of
Bengal and Kamrid under his younger son, Bughraé Khan. He was a
generous patron of art and literature, and his assemblies were a popular

rrendezvous of poets. Khusrau speaks of him gratefully in several of
his works. Badaoni gives some specimens of his poetry which indicate
a very high level of artistic ability.®

We now come to the time of Khusrau himself, in which our poet
stands head and shoulders above his contemporaries.

The only other poet of first order in this age was undoubtedly his
friend Amir Hasan, nicknamed ‘the Sa‘di of India’ on account of the
purity and flowing simplicity of his ghazals. But even Hasan failed to
attain the great charm of Khusrau’s lyrical poems, while he had
absolutely no chance of approaching him in qasida or mathnawi. Like
Khusrau, he became a devout disciple of Nizimuddin Auliya in his old
age, and died at an advanced age in Daulatébid where he had to go
against his will, like so many other inhabitants of Delhi in the reign
of the eccentric monarch Muhammad Tughlaq. He has left behind a
diwan comprising qasidas, ghazals, mathnawis, fragments, and quatrains.

We learn the names of several other poets of this age from Barni,
Badaoni, and Firishta. Thus there were Muayyad Jajurmi, Amir
Arsalan Katibi, Qadi Mugith Hansawi, Baqi Khatib, Shihab, Sa‘d
Mantiqi, ‘Abid,‘ etc. Khusrau often had to complain of the jealous
behaviour of the last two towards himself. Little or no traces of their
poetry, however, have been left to enable us to judge their merits. But
it would be safe to presume that none of them rose to the level of
Khusrau, nor, in fact, did any of his immediate successors.5

THE LIFE
CHAPTER I

Origin oF AMIR KHUSRAU

When writing the biography of a literary person, it is impossible
to ignore the political conditions of his age; the state of the country
and also of the society in which he was born and grew up, in which
he imbibed the first ideas that moulded his juvenile mind and helped
to mature his genius to its full vigour and bloom. Every man is
influenced unconsciously by his surroundings, and a poet or a writer,
as he is essentially a thinker and so looks at things more carefully and
deeply, turning them over in his mind, trying to draw conclusions from
them or to explain them, is influenced much more than a person of
ordinary intellect and common insight. In fact the whole character
and nature of a writer’s work are affected by the events of his epoch and
reflect the spirit of the time he lived in. A Homer living in the time
of heroes that vied with their gods in courage and power, that were
almost demi-gods, would naturally produce an epic like the Iliad that
stirs the lifeless heart and infuses into it a spirit to do ‘ one more brave
deed before death’, to defy fate, to scorn hardships, and to conquer all

obstacles ; while a Dante living in an age of decay and disruption, a
period of political enfeeblement and moral emasculation, would tend to
become more moody, more introspective, more inclined to brood on things
beyond this life and to create with his wonderful imagination and sublime
genius, not a story of brave deeds and wars, of long voyages and heroic
adventures, but a morbid tale of heaven and hell.

Mutanabbi! and Abi Tammam ? saw with their own eyes the heroic
deeds of their patrons, their ‘holy’ wars, their successful contests against
their enemies, and so their poetry is manly and heroic: it almost has
in it the ring of the spear, the twang of the bow, and the clatter of
the sword. But what could one expect from Abii Nuwas* or Abul-
‘Atahiya,‘ who lived in a time when the kingdom of Baghdad was

1 Abia Tib al-Mutanabbi, for a long time a favourite courtier and poet-laureate
of Saifuddaula, the Hamadani of Aleppo, has sung his patron’s praises and his fights
against the Franks in many a glowing ode. See Nicholson: Lit. Hist. of Arabia,
pp. 304-313.

2 Aba Tammam lived in the time of the caliphs Mamiim and M‘utasim. See
Nicholson, pp. 129-130.

3 Abt Nuwéas, the court poet and boon-companion of Harin-al-Rashid. For
his life and poetry, see Nicholson : Lit. Hist. of the Arabs., pp. 292-296.

+ A contemporary poet. See ibid., pp. 296-303.

flowing with ‘milk and honey’, when the sword had been hung up and
the armour stowed away and in the court of the Caliph one heard
only the pleasant melody of the reb&b or the amusing jokes of jesters
like Abi Dulima ? What could one expect from them except an effemi-
nate poetry, lyrics descriptive of love and pleasure, of the charms of the,
beautiful damsels, and the virtues of the glittering red wine, or unhealthy,
sad, and melancholy tirades on the vanity of this life and the need for
‘dying before death’? Both these poets, so different apparently are
characteristic of their age. Abu Nuwds is happy and careless because
he could enjoy the pleasures that surrounded him, while his unlucky
contemporary, unable by nature and circumstances to partake of them,
could only console himself by preaching a crusade against them.’

This, true as it is in the case of writers of all ages and countries,
is especially so in the case of most of the Eastern writers, for in the
East, more than elsewhere, literature and art have always flourished
under the fostering shadow of kings and their vassals. Most of the
Eastern poets particularly were no more than bards; bards of a very
high genius and lofty imagination very often, but all the same bards.
Their chief care was to sing the praises of their patrons to raise them
up to the skies, to immortalise, as they would say, their names. No
doubt they have also produced poetry of a much higher order than such
panegyrics, poetry as full of love and emotion, of deep human feeling
and universal appeal as could be found anywhere. Yet it has to be
admitted that this sort of poetry was only a subordinate branch, a
foster-child, a product of the few stolen moments when the poet for a
short while ceased to be a courtier, put off his khil‘at and laid his ‘asa
in a corner and was a man more than anything else.

Yet it would be wrong to imagine that these high-flown and roseate
panegyrics are worthless. Apart from their esthetic value as wonderful
specimens of artistic sense, elegant taste, and mastery of language,
they are in many cases of great historic importance. They very often
describe, not only how the king or the noble slaughtered single-handed
a whole army of his vile foes, or how his horse scarcely deigned to tread
on the sordid earth and vied with the north wind in swiftness, or how his
throne was placed so high that thought itself had to pile up the nine
skies one® above another ere it could kiss its pedestal, or how his bright
visage shamed the moon and compelled the sun to hide its ugly face

‘

1 It ia said that Abul-‘Ataéhiya was meagre, short, and ugly man. Maa‘idi
relates a humourously pathetic story about his love for a beautiful slave-girl. See
Mas‘idi (Barbier de Meynard) VI, pp. 240-244 and 333.

among the clouds—but also they describe, albeit often in a very coloured
and distorted way, some of the real historical events that actually took
place before or during the lifetime of a poet. Such poems are of
immense importance for augmenting the historical data necessary to
construct our history of a particular period, and make it, at the same
time, more than ever, imperative for a student of their authors to study
carefully the history connected with their times.

In the case of a poet like Amir Khusrau, then, whose life was.
intimately connected with kings and princes, who lived to see the reigns
of more than seven kings, accompanied several of them in their campaigns
and held offices under at least five, we shall, of course, have to consider
the political history of his time,—to follow briefly the chain of events
extending over a little more than three-score years, since about 1253
A.D. (the year of his birth) to 1325 a.p., when the old monarch Tughlaq
Shah was mysteriously killed by the fall of a pavilion built for his
reception by his son and heir, Mohd. Tughlaq.

But to commence our narrative we must go back about a hundred
years and study some of the events that occurred outside India, the
land of his birth, but which were destined to exercise a profound
influence on its history, for Amir Khusrau’s ancestors came to India
from Central Asia, Transoxiana or Khorasan, a land that was, so to say,
the cradle of an upheaval unparalleled, perhaps, in the history of the
world.

Chengiz Khan, the ‘Curse of God’ as Muslim historians describe
him, rose from Transoxiana in the first half of the thirteenth century
with his wild hosts, his lean, bony, wolfish soldiers clumsily dressed,
ill-equipped, riding on horses ‘ that looked like donkeys’, and shook to
its very foundations the whole Islamic world.1 The Mongol hosts
conquered all before them. They came, they slaughtered and burnt,
they destroyed and devastated, and left the rich plains and fine valleys
of the Islamic countries like a field over which has passed a storm of
locusts. Mosques were defiled, palaces razed to the ground, and
libraries full of precious manuscripts consigned to fire. One Islamic
monarch alone, the gallant Jalaluddin of Khwarizm who succeeded his
ill-starred father Muhammad Khwarizm Shah, waged a long and deter-
mined struggle, as heroic as it was desperate, against the Tartar fury.
a kiss on the throne of Qizil Arsalan’ and Khusrau replying says of ‘ Alé-ud-din

‘How can thought ever reach the spur of (my) king to kiss it : it may have

Khwirizm Shah’s dominions extended over ‘a large area from the Ural
Mountains to the Persian Gulf, and from the Indus almost to the
Euphrates and included the whole of Persia with the exception of
Khuzistan and Fars’. Bit by bit, however, he was forced back. City
after city fell before the irresistible Tartar onsets and the gallant monarch
had to flee to India to save his life, whence he returned to enjoy a brief
spell of power only to meet a sad death in 1231 a.p. at the hands of
-@ Kurdish mountaineer.”

' Now, as we know, Chengiz Khan’s vast empire, founded on the
ruins of the old civilization, comprised among other regions Transoxiana,
situated mainly between the Sir and Amu rivers, but including also on
the north-east the hill-ranges and steppes lying beyond the right bank
of the Sir, east of the Kipchak plains and west of the lakes Issigkul
and Alanor. Towards the east the empire included the greater part
of the country now known as Chinese Turkestan, Farghana or Khokhand,
and Badakkhshin, while towards the south it embraced Kunduz, Balkh,
and at the outset Khorasan, ‘a country which at that time spread
‘abstward and beyond Herat and Ghaznin, and southward to Makran.

xovas perhaps the most extensive appanage of all and within its
Mxe to be found the greatest variety of races and tribes and the
versity of modes of life. It comprised, on the one hand, some
SYichest agricultural districts peopled by settled inhabitants far
feed in Asiatic civilization and some of the most flourishing cities
"Asia, while on the other hand, some of the rudest hill-tribes or
Hazaras as they were called then, had their homes in the southern
highlands ’.®

It was these hill-men or Hazaras that swelled mostly the Tartar
armies of Chengiz Khan. But we must not suppose that the term
Hazara denoted any particular race. Thus in the Tarikb-i-Rashidi
we find Hazara used for hill-men or mountaineers without reference to
its original meaning (which we shall presently consider) or to any racial
consideration. In fact as Raverty * explains Hazaras were not a tribe
but simply soldiers of Chengiz Khan’s army recruited from various
tribes, Moghuls or Turks, divided into groups of one thousand each,
and so ‘hazara’ is merely a Persian or Tazik rendering of the term

1 See Browne : Lit. Hist. of Persia, II, 426.

2 Ibid., p. 447. For a contemporary account of this gallant monarch see
the history written by his secretary and attendant Muhammad al-Nasawi, translated
and edited by O. Houdas. (‘ Histoire du Sultan Djelaleddin Mankobirti.’ Paris,
1891, 2 vols.)

‘

ming ’ (a thousand). Chengiz Khan’s army, for instance, consisted of
several such divisions. It is probable, however, that these Hazaras
had descriptive names derived either from the names of their chiefs
or of the particular region to which they belonged. Raverty, thus,
mentions the names of several of the Haziras that were to be found in
Chengiz Khan’s armies, and Hamdullah al-Mustawfi makes mention of
the Hazaras of Shadi and Aughan as living in the north and south of
Persia respectively.2. This, again, shows that the term ‘hazara’ was
neither a racial or ethnological nor a topographical designation but
indicated simply a certain type of nomadic people, generally warlike,
chiefly employed as soldiers and sending quotas of thousands to their
over-lords at the time of war.

But we cannot say definitely that the term, as Major Raverty
explains it, was applied simply to the clans who formed the armies of
Chengiz Khan or even that it originated in his time. It is quite possible
that this appellation was known before this time, that ‘ hazara’, like
another ambiguous term Turk, which we shall consider presently,
embraced in its wide application a certain class of warlike tribes who
were generally in the service of warring potentates. In fact the name
‘ hazara ’, essentially a Persian and not a Turkish or Mongol word, would
suggest that the term probably did not originate during the time of the
Tartar conquests, for there appears to be no reason why the chroniclers
of the Mongols should have changed the Turki ‘ ming’ into the Persian
‘hazara ’’ when they have retained in their works so many Turki words
that could more conveniently, and also, perhaps, more reasonably be
substituted by their more familiar Persian equivalents.? I am, therefore,
on the whole, more inclined to interpret hazara as a common designation
of a large number of tribes, whose chief occupation was agriculture and
pasturing and who furnished soldiers on the occasion of fights among
their suzerains, and who, long after they had ceased to send their quotas
of ‘thousands’ to their masters and had settled down in countries far
away from their original homes, still retained their old designation and

1 Re the derivation of the term from ‘hazar’ (a thousand) it is interesting
to note a verse of Amir Khusrau himself: (Ind. Off. MS. of Kulliyaét, No. 1187,
fol. 6370) :

oy le Col ye ¥ er Nya le oy, 16 5 F
‘If there be a thousand paynim horsemen, thy (wicked) eye would be the
chief of that “ hazara’”’.’

2 Hamdullah : Tarikhi-Guzida (Gibb. Mem. Series), pp. 66, 67, 69 and pp. 704
and 709.

3 See, for instance, the words, »W = and ji » and J so commonly used
by Persian historians, and hosts of other Turki words. ;


--- Page 24 ---

in, some cases also gave it to the country in which they happened to
settle down.!

Now almost all the biographers of Amir Khusrau agree that he
belonged to a haz&ra clan named hazara-i-Lichin and that he was
of Turkish origin? Amir Khusrau himself nowhere mentions that he
belonged to a hazira clan, which is not strange ; for as we have already
seen ‘hazira’ was not any racial or ethnographical designation and
was hence hardly worth much importance. He, however, says explicitly
‘On various occasions that he was a Turk and that his ancestral pro-
fession was military service. His very title, ‘Turkullah’* (The Turk
or Soldier of God*) bestowed upon him by his religious preceptor, the
saint Nizimuddin Auliya, shows that the poet was of Turkish origin.

We need not enter here into any long discussion about the exact
signification of the term Turk, especially as it has been so well and
lucidly discussed in the Introduction to Tarikh-i-Rashidi of Mirza Haider
Dughlat by Elias and D. Ross.© We may only explain here that the
term has been indifferently used by the Persian historians in a dual
sense. It is sometimes employed in an ethnographical sense and denotes
a certain race which apparently inhabited parts of Central Asia,
Transoxiana, Khorasan, etc. at the time of the Mongol invasion and
supremacy, and which in physiognomy and other personal and social
features and characteristics differed considerably from the Mongols.

1 Note, for example, the Hazéra country in India. See Imp. Gaz. of India
Vol. XIII, p. 76 seq., and Ency. of Islam, V. II, pp. 297-298. Curiously
enough some authorities misled by the fact that ‘hazara’ is both the name of a
people as well as a country have stated that Amir Khusrau’s ancestors came from

‘ As you have been pleased to call your servant the “ Turk of God ”’, hold his

a soldier, thus Mars, the God of War, is often called : ‘ Turk-i-falak ’, ‘the Turk of
the Sky’. .

On the other hand the term is very often used in a sociological sense
and covers all the nomadic people of Central Asia who lived in steppes
and hills, as opposed to Tajiks or Taziks; the civilized town-dwellers.
Even Turkish writers like Abul Ghazi have made this dual use of the
word,! and it is interesting to note that even in modern times in Turkey
the word ‘Turk’, or rather ‘Turuk’ seems often to have been employed
in the sense of a peasant or boor, perhaps like the Arabic word ‘ A‘rabi’. 2/
In the case of Amir Khusrau’s ancestors, then, it is possible that they.
may have been Turks in either of the two senses of the word. That.
they are described as ‘Hazaras’ would suggest a nomadic origin, but at
the same time, although unfortunately we have not much material to
form a definite idea of the physiognomy of the poet or of his ancestors,
it is certain that they were not Mongols—were quite different from the
‘uncouth barbarians’, whom Khusrau ridicules so severely and
humorously in his sketch of the captive Mongols brought to the court of:
Kaiqobid.* They were, in short, Turks in the generally accepted sense
of the word ; they belonged to the original inhabitants of Turkestan,,
distinct from the Mongols.

We shall now consider briefly the name Lachin or Lajin, as it is
sometimes written. Lachin, a Turkish word meaning a falcon, was
quite a popular name among the Turks of Central Asia. Most of the
biographers describe Lachin to be the name of the tribe to which
Khusrau’s father belonged, but according to some it was the name of
his father. Amir Khusrau says little more about his origin than that
he was a Turk, but he frequently styles himself as ‘ Khusraw-i-Lachin ’,*
literally ‘Khusrau of Lachin’, which may mean ‘Son of Lachin’, for
this sort of ‘idafat’ is very often used to denote the father’s name, the
usual ‘ibn ’ (=son) being omitted. Mas‘td-i-Sa‘d-i-Salman, for instance,
means Mas‘iid, son of Sa‘d, son of Salman.’ But, as Mirza Muhammad
explains, the following name may be not necessarily that of the father,
but of the grandfather or a still more remote ancestor also.® It is more
likely that the latter is the case with the name Khusrawi-Lachin, for
Khusrau mentions his father on various occasions as Saif or Saif-i-

1 See zbid., pp. 84 and 89 (Introduction).

2 Thus Bianchi, in his dictionary, says: ‘Turcs, peuple des Turcs ou des
Turcomans; Ture, Turcoman; Rustre, grossier, barbare. Le Turcs de l’empire
Ottoman ne veulent pas se appeller de ce nom, mais de celui de gle’.

3 See infra.

4 See, for instance, I‘jaz-i-Khusrawi, II, p. 242, and ibid., V, letter 2, where
he adds also Sultani to his name.

5 See Chahér Mag&la (Hawashi by Mirza Mohd.), p. 142.

Shamei, and at one place- as Sultaéni-i-Shamsi,' ‘but nowhere does he
give his name as Lachin. This last was apparently the name of a chief
of the clan to which Khusrau belonged, probably that of an ancestor of
‘his, who gave his name to his tribe. Khusrau, according to Sultan
‘Husain Mirza and Jami,? belonged to a noble family and so it is most
‘probable that Lachin, the head of the tribe, was his direct ancestor, a
grandfather or perhaps a great-grandfather.

The next point that attracts our attention is the question : where
did these Hazaras of Lachin live before they left their ancestral home
and migrated to India, and at what time did they, or Khusrau’s father,
come to this country ? Most of the biographers assert that the original
home of the tribe, or at least its home at the time of the Mongol up-
heaval, was near Balkh,® the ‘Arch of Islam’. But a few, notably
Daulat Shah, declare that the tribe had its original home in Kish or the
environs of Qarshi and Pymurgh.* Daulat Shah says: ‘Amir Khusrau
was of Turkish descent. It is said that his ancestral home was Kish,
now known as the Qubbat-ul-Khadra°® (The Green Dome), while some
say that he belonged to the Hazaras of Lachin who were living in the
environments of Qarshi and Pymurgh and that during the disturbed
times ® of Chengiz Khan, these people fleeing from Mawaraé-un-Nahr
came to India and settled in Delhi. Amir Khusrau’s father was the
chief and leader of these people.’ Now Kish,’ or wore correctly Kishsh,
now generally known as Shahr-i-Sabz (not Qubbat-ul-Khadra as Daulat
says) stands on a small stream known as Kushka Darya that runs almost
parallel to the Sughd river, both ending in marshes. In the middle
ages, according to Ibmi Haukal, it had a castle, was strongly fortified,
and occupied, exclusive of its suburbs, a square mile of ground, the
Kish territory extending over four days journey across in every direction
and being famed for its fertility. In the fourth century of the hegira
the city stood on the main stream of the river now called Kushka that

_was known by the name of Nahr-ul-Qassarin which arose in the Jabl
Sayam. Nahr-i-Arsid, running to the north, was crossed, one league
beyond the road to Samarqand, by Jay Rid ; the Khushk Rid ran to
the south, one league from Kish; while another stream Khizar Rid
lay eight leagues beyond this. These streams after irrigating the various
districts around Kish flowed together and became a single stream which
passed by the city of Nasaf or Qarshi. In later days Kish acquired
fame as the birth-place of Timur, who rebuilt the city, and whose place
Aq-Sarai in it was his favourite residence.’ It was about this time
that the city became known as Shahr-i-Sabz (The Green city). Qarshi #
or Nasaf was situated, as we have noted above, more than a hundred
miles down stream below Kish. It has generally been called Nasaf
by the medieval Arabs and Nakhshab by the Persians. It was a Mongol
prince Kapak Khan, who after the Mongol invasion (13th cent. a.p.}
built a palace here and gave it the name of Qarshi. This city also had
a strong castle and extensive suburbs. The third name mentioned by
Daulat Shah, viz. Paymurgh, is certainly a misnomer for Maymurgh,
mentioned by Arab geographers as a suburb of Kish.

All these places of course are in the country known as Mawara-un-
Nahr or Transoxiana, and so if Daulat Shah is to be believed, the Hazaras
of Lachin lived in this country. But the bulk of the evidence supports
the theory of a home in or about Balkh. Thus Jami, a contemporary
of Daulat Shah, and Sultan Husain Mirza Baiqara, both hold the latter
opinion, and it is further strengthened by what we have already mentioned

1 For Kish. See Le Strange (Camb., 1905), p. 469, and Ency. of Islam, V. IT,
p. 786, where the name is transcribed as Kash, the reason advanced being that in
old histories it is often made to rhyme with ‘ dilkash ’ charming. That phrases

like sae J, etc. often occur in those histories, is true. See for instance Yazdi :

Zafar Nameh (Bib. Ind.), p. 301 4S > We and p. 801 (AS > Ke
and V. II, p. 18:

WS caret a mjd g ys SoS SH oT Jel Js
But I prefer the reading Kish or Kishsh as given by the old Arab geographers.
There is no harm in reading oT as the alliteration aimed at still holds good and

in the verse cited above ‘Kina Kash’ can be read ‘Kina Kish’. According to
Yazdi the city became known as Shar-i-Sabz on account of the fertility and green-
ness of the lands in and around it in spring (p. 301, V. 1) and that as a home of
learning and scholars it was known as ‘Qubbat-ul-‘Ilm’. It is these two names
which Daulat Shah apparently confuses into ‘ Qubbat-ul-Khadra’. Timur built
the ‘ White Palace’ in it in 781 nH. (See tbid.).

2 For Qarshi: See Le Strange, p. 470. Qarshi in Mongol dialect means a
palace. See also Ency. of Islam, V. II. Nakbshab, of course, is the famous
place where al-Muqanna‘ is said to have created the artificial moon, called Mah-i-
Nakbshab. :

about Khorasan, namely that it was the home of the nemadic tribes
who lived in its hills and steppes and were known as Hazdras. This
would give Amir Khusrau a Khorasan origin, which I am reluctant to
assign him, for it is evident from so many sarcastic remarks in his works
about Khorasan that the poet was not particularly fond of that country.
He ridicules it, describing it as ‘ hell” in winter,’ he ridicules the people,
the ‘ bilais ’,? as he often calls them, and he ridicules their language or
rather the various dialectic peculiarities. met with among them. He
praises, on the other hand, the language of Mawara- un-Nahr likening
it to the Persian employed in India® of which he speaks so proudly.
It is possible, perhaps, that this bitter sarcasm for Khorasan arose out
of his burning zeal for his adopted country, or rather the country adopted
by his father, that he was like the new convert who is loud in praise of
his new creed and equally vehement in denouncing the one he has
discarded. But I am inclined to agree with Daulat Shah on this point.
The description of Mawaraé-un-Nahr given by historians and geographers,
a country inhabited by Turks, handsome, brave, generous and soldiers

1 eer Oe ols £ Fab re, be

‘Winter should be enjoyed in India, for Khorasan (in winter) is a frozen hell.’

2 Bala was the name by which the Indian writers generally designated the
northern provinces, Balkb, Bukbara, etc. and so Khorasan, whence ‘ Balais’ the
inhabitants of Balé. In later times this word was substituted by ‘ vilayat’ and
‘ vildyati’ denoted a thing or a peraon belonging to Kabul or Qandhar or to some
place further north. But curiously enough in common parlance nowadays viliyat
is synonymous with Europe and especially England.

8 This statement of Amir Khusrau is interesting from s linguistic point of
view. He remarks elsqwvhere that the Persian used in India is the Parst-i-Dari.
Now we know that the language of Transoxiana and also, perhaps, that of
Khorasan has been described by old geographers to be ‘dari’. al-Maqdasi,
for example, (de Geoje, p. 314) says of the language spoken in Bukhara:
‘As to the language of Bukhara, it is the same as that of Sughd, only

Do

there are slight variations ( |e. 3 ), and they speak the Dari language.’

Thus Amir Khusrau is probably referring to this language when he speaks of
the similarity between the languages of India and Transoxiana. On the other
hand he says of the Khoraésanis that they have got no standard language and no
settled idiom. To use his own words: The Khordsini says chi ( .g ) for +
while some say ‘ Kaji’ for ‘Kuja’ ... . but the Persian speech in India from
the river Sind to the sea-shore (i.e. the extreme south) is one tongue ... . and
this Persian of ours is the original (or pure) Persian > “.~ b. (See below and also
the Introduction.) .

Parsi-i-Darf, on the other hand, also means ‘pure Persian '—the original
language without any intermixture or variations, and as such has been described
to be the language of the blessed ones in Paradise. The Prophet is said to have
declared that ‘ the language spoken in Paradise will be Arabic or the Dari Persian ’.
(See Persian Dictionaries like Burh&n-i-Qati*‘, etc.)

by birth, would induce one to regard it as the home of a warlike people
like Khusrau’s ancestors. Al-Istakbari,’ for instance, says of its in-
habitants, after a description of their generosity and hospitality: ‘ As
to their courage and bravery, there is not among the Islamic peoples
any with greater share of fighting against the infidels, and that is because
all boundaries of Mawara-un-Nahr are formed by the lands of the
unbelievers, .. . . and also it is well known that there is no people
among the Moslems braver than these Turks—they are the rampart
and bulwark of Islam against the (infidel) Turks .. . . With all this,
they are the best of people in paying obedience to their elders and the
most gentle in serving their superiors and their equals. It was this
that induced the Caliphs to send for men from Mawara-un-Nahr, and
their armies. consisted of Turks on account of the latter’s superiority
over all classes of men in point of courage, formidability, bravery, and
‘elan’, and the peasants of Mawaré-un-Nahr were their generals, their
attendants, and their favourite servants.’ 2

In my opinion, therefore, the original home of the Lachin Hazaras
was in Transoxiana. Being generally a nomadic people, however, they
may have moved on to Balkh in Khorasan, possibly during their migra-
tion to India. Thus starting from somewhere near Kish, the tribe
apparently first came to Qarshi and then lower down to Balkh, whence
they ultimately proceeded further south and crossing the Indus entered
India early in the thirteenth century as we shall presently see.

With the meagre information at our disposal concerning this tribe,
we cannot form any idea of the exact time of this migration into India,
but we know definitely that Khusrau’s father was in the service of
Shamsuddin Iltitmish. We have reasons also to believe that his people

1 Al-Istakhari, pp. 286-87.

2 That Mawaré-un-Nahr continued in much later times to be a rich mine for
soldiers and warriors, eager to get an opportunity for offering their services to
ambitious princes, can be seen from what the author of Kitaéb-i-Yamini aays (Tr.
Reynolds, Lond. 1858, p. 450) while describing Mahmtd Ghaznawi’s preparations
for the conquest of Kannauj: ‘In those days nearly 20 thousand men had come
from the plains of Mawaré-un-Nahr through zeal for Islam and they sat down
waiting for the Sultan’s movements, striking their numerous swords and uttering
the shouts of holy war’. See also infra and the verse quoted above from Yazdi, i.e.

PS yaa an msde GTS ST Jol ds
But the main source of that ferocious army was Turkestan especially Kish’
‘of Timur’s army) also illustrates the point in question.

8 See infra. The name of this king is spelt otherwise in various ways,
Altmish, Altimish, Iltimish, Iyal-timish, etc. But the reading il-titmish may be
regarded aa finally established by the following verse of Amir Khusrau in which
the exact translation is given, namely ‘he has seized the world ’.

had been in India for some time before he went to the capital and offered
his services to that prince. Daulat Shih, while describing Jalaluddin
Khwarizm Shaih’s flight before the Mongol armies and his brief career
in India after the famous dash through the boiling waters of the Indus
accompanied by only a few faithful survivors of his armies, says that a
number of the Lachin Hazaras, to whom belonged Amir Khusrau’s
father, joined him (Jalaluddin) and (together) they conquered the fortress
of Kargasbal.! This statement unfortunately is not supported by
any other authority, but there is no reason why we should doubt Daulat
Shih’s assertion. Several Hazara tribes, in fact, had migrated to
India during the time of Chengiz Khan’s conquests and settled in
the north-western provinces. Thus although Abul Fadl asserts that
the Hazéras of India were brought to that country by Amir Timur,
there is evidence to believe that they had settled there in much earlier
times, and that Amir Timur only sought their help in his campaign
in India and formed his garrisons out of them.? It is quite likely that
the Hazaras, a warlike people and Turks by descent, should have sided
with their kindred people, the followers of Timur. As a matter of fact,
they were always eager to offer their services as mercenaries to suitable
patrons. It is quite likely, therefore, that the Hazaras of Lichin had
settled in the north-west parts of India along with other Hazaras before
Jalaluddin crossed the Indus? and that looking upon him as a hero
and a bulwark against the heathen hordes, their common enemy,
they were glad to join him in his distressed condition and to help him in
securing for himself a temporary refuge in India. In any case it is
certain that these Hazaras came to India during the time of Chengiz
‘Khan and some of them moving further south-east sought employment
with the Sultan of Delhi, Shamsuddin II-titmish, and among these latter
was Khusrau’s father Amir Saifuddin Mahmid.

The Mongol fury, thus, that wasted countries and upset thrones,
“that wrenched crowns off the heads of ‘kings descendants of kings’

1 Daulat Shah: Tezkira, p. 146. No other historian mentions the name
Kargasbal. I think that it is rather the name of some petty Hindu chieftain
(bal being a misnomer for pal) than that of a place.

2 See Ency. of Islam, Vol. II.

3 This event occurred in the year 619. See Tarikh-i-Jahankusha (V. 1, p. 107),
and al-Nasawi (Ed. O. Houdas), pp. 85, seq. of text and p. 141 seq. of translation
(Vol. II). Note that al-Nasawi mentions several Turkish tribes who had joined
the army of Jaléluddin. According to him Jalaluddin fought Zana (probably a
mistake for Rana) Chatra, or Shatra, of Jidf (Koh-i-Jiid) and then Nasiruddin
Qub&cha of Multan. See also Raverty (V. 1, p. 293, N. 5); Habeeb-us-Siyar
(Vol. II, part IV, p. 187) and Elliot (II. 549). Shatra is evidently a misnomer for
Sumra, as the Sumras ruled parts of Sind at that time.

and pulled down palaces and castles sacred for centuries, so that the
sound of their fall resounded all over the world, hurled, in its wild career,
a handful of simple warriors from their peaceful abode to a strange land,
and thus, incidentally, gave to India a poet the like of whom she had
never produced before and in all probability will never produce again.

Khusrau’s father, whom the poet as we have seen above styles ::
simply as Saif-i-Shamsi, or Sultani-i-Shamsi, was named Amir Saifuddin
Mahmid, and as he belonged to the tribe of Lachin he seems often to |
have been designated ‘Amir-i-Lachin.!. In India he settled down at °
Patiyali,? a small town in the district of Etah, otherwise known as Mumin-
pore or Muminabad, by which in those days flowed the river Ganges,
but which is now miles away from the river, and entered the service of
Shamsuddin I]-titmish, the second of the Slave kings of India, whence
he acquired his sobriquet of Shamsi.

Shamsuddin II-titmish, the favourite slave of Qutbuddin Aybek,®
himself a slave of Mu‘izuddin bin Sam Mohammad, the Sultan of Ghaznin
and his trusted vice-regent in India, had a wonderful career. Bought
as a slave with another Turk for a hundred thousand jitals* by
Qutbuddin Aybek, he soon won the favour of his master and was
appointed Sarjindar.5 Later he was promoted to be Mir-i-Shikar ®
(the master of the Hunt), and obtained successively the fiefs of Gwaliyar,
Baran, and Badaon and won for himself other honours and distinctions
through his conspicuous bravery during his master’s campaigns against
the latter’s enemies.

1 See for instance the anecdote, related by various authorities, given below.

2 Raverty (T. N. Trans., p. 551”) gives the position of Patiyaélias lat. 27° 41
and long. 79° 40. Abul Fadl (Ain-i-Akbari; Calcutta, Vol. I, p. 35) mentions the
town in the sircar of Kannauj. That it was situated on the Ganges in the old
days is proved by what Amir Khusrau says of it (Dibacha Ghurrat-ul-
Kamal: Ind. Off., MS.): ‘For a few days... . stayed in the fortified town
of Muminpore commonly known as Patiyali on the bank of the Ganges’. Badaoni
(I. 43) saya: Patiyali . . . a town (,~2,) on the bank of the Ganges and the
place where Amir Khusrau was born and brought up... .’ See also Dara Shikoh
(Safinat-ul-Auliya) who gives the other name Muminabad and describes Patiyali
to be a dependency of Sambhal; and Garcin de Tassy (Lit. Hind.), Vol. I, p. 299;
Gulzar-i-Ibrahim, f. 262.

8 Sir D. Ross has pointed out to me thati Aybek meaning moon-lord would
very well render the Sanskrit name Chandra Gupta.

Qutbuddin Aybek dying at Lahore in the year he was

ions. A.D.
summoned by the nobles from Badaon’ to assume the management of
the kingdom. Setting aside Aybek’s son Aram Shah, he soon ascended
the throne of Delhi, stabilized the dominions, defeated his rival Nasiruddin
Qubacha and drove him to Multan, overpowered and imprisoned Sultan
Tajuddin Yuldiiz, another strong Turkish chief, and reduced to sub-
mission the ruler of the far-off province of Lakhnauti, Sultan Ghiyéthuddin
‘Iwaz Khalji. The strong fortress of Rantambhur and Mandu
(Mandawar) ? fell before his armies in 623 H. and the Hindu rajahs were
compelled to pay homage to his rising star. Finally, Malik Nasiruddin
RQubicha was hunted down to his retreat in Multan and Uchcha and the
‘unfortunate chief ended his life by a desperate leap from the fortress of
Bhakar into the river (Indus), thus leaving his successful rival the sole
monarch of the country of ‘Hind and Sind’ as far as the shore of
the sea.

,Shamsuddin, a brave and generous monarch, welcomed to his
capital many of the unfortunate people driven from their homes by the
Mongols. ‘Towards men of various sorts and degrees, Qadis, Imims,
Muftis, and the like; and to darweshes and monks, land-owners and
farmers, traders, strangers, and travellers from great cities, his benefac-
tions were universal. From the very outset of his reign and the dawn
of the morning of his sovereignty in congregating eminent doctors of
religion and law, venerable sayyids, maliks, amirs, sadrs, and (other)
great men, the Sultan used, yearly, to expend about ten millions ; and
people from various parts of the world he gathered together at Dihli

. This city, through the number of the grants and unbounded
munificence of that pious monarch became the retreat and resting place
for the learned, the virtuous, and the excellent of various parts of the
world . . . . And those who by the mercy of God the most High escaped
from the toils of the calamities sustained by the provinces and cities
of ‘Ajam and the misfortunes caused by the irruption of the itifidel
Mughals, made the capital of that sovereign, their asylum, refuge,
resting place, and nook of safety.’ Thus says Minhaj-i-Siraj in his
Tabagat-i-Nasiri, while describing the reign of Shamsuddin I1-titmish.
And among these numerous refugees who found a shelter and a home
under the fostering care of this generous sovereign was Amir Saifuddin

Mahmiid who linked his own fortune, and probably those of his followers,
to the growing might and prevailing sway of the slave Sultan.

We do not know what position Amir Saifuddin Mahmid held exactly,
but we do know that he was an Amir, held a respectable position in
the army, and was also probably granted some fief in Patiyali. Very
little is known about his career in India and his name is not mentioned
by any of the contemporary or even later historians. But, if Amir
Khusrau is to be believed, he must have been a man of no insignificant
position, for the poet asserts : ‘ Il-tiitmish conquered the world with his
(Saifuddin’s) help, for he was a sword drawn by God from the scabbard
of His might’.2 His marriage with the daughter of ‘Imad-ul-Mulk,®
an important official during the reigns of Shamsuddin and his successors,
would also suggest that the Amir held a high and honourable position
in the court of the king. He seems, moreover, to have taken an
important part in the various wars his master waged against his enemies.
Khusrau himself supplies the only information that has been handed
down to us concerning his father’s career. In his Dibacha to the
Ghurrat-ul-Kamal he says: ‘My father, Saif-i-Shamsi, who with his
bright visage was the sword of the sun,* was famous for his bravery.
A Turk is an angel only in a dream, but he was an angel when awake.
Nowhere but in a dream could one see an angel coming from Bala.
The qualities of an angel were so deep-rooted in his nature that he never

Latin Amiratus, Amiralius (whence the word Admiral). It is often abbreviated to

allowance of twelve hundred tankahs annually. (Barni, p. 197.)

Ghurrat-ul-Kamal.)

It is interesting to note here that Khusrau is evidently punning upon the
phrase ‘ jahan giriftan’ and ‘il-titmish ’, which, as I have tried to explain above,
may be construed to mean ‘ world-conqueror’ or ‘jahangir’. He says in the
‘Ashiga (8.0.8. MS., p. 57).

By
reddened his eye! even for the sake of a black-eyed houri. He was
rich? in worldly goods and (with his piety) was a ‘wali’ (saint)* in
matters celestial.’

This meagre information, coupled with a few more facts, supplied
again by the poet himself, of which we shall avail ourselves later on,
is all that we possess about Khusrau’s father. The author of the
Tabaqat-i-Nasiri gives a fairly lengthy list of the important Shamsi
‘Maliks’. Among them we find several with the name of Saifuddin,
but it is impossible to identify any of the latter with Khusrau’s father.‘
This omission is due probably not so much to the fact that Amir
Waifuddin Mahmiid was not a person of sufficient importance to be
included in a list of the notables of his time as to the peculiarly cir-
cumlocutional and somewhat desultory style of the historians of that age.
They would fill pages after pages with the praises of a king or a noble
to whose bounty and favour they happened to be personally indebted,
and ignore other names and persons whom they had no such cause
to pay attention to. Shams-i-Siraéj does not even mention ‘Imad-ul-
Mulk, while, if we believe Barni, he was already a man of high rank
in the days of Shamsuddin.®

CHAPTER II

BirtH AND EarLy YOUTH; CAREER UNDER THE REIGNS OF
BaLBAN AND KaAIQoBAD.

Amir Saifuddin Mahmid, as we have said above, settled at Patiyali

1 ‘Chashm Surkh Kardan dar chize’, to be anxious or eager to get something,
to hanker after a thing or person, Khusrau uses this idiom very frequently, and so
also his contemporary Hasan.

2 ‘amir bid’, meaning, of course, both rich and as having the title of Amir.

8 ~Y ’ url. again a pun, for ay y means both the state of being a wali

or saint, as well as a country or province whence wali, a governor.

4 Among these maliks is one Malik Saifuddin Binkhan (?) Aybek Khitai
whom I was almost tempted to identify with Khusrau’s father, for he is described
as & man extremely good-natured, gentle, polite, and pious and at the same time
famous for his bravery and courage. He is said to have met his death by a fall
from horse-back in the reign of Nasiruddin Mahmid, and as we shall see Khusrau’s
father also died during this monarch’s reign. But the following facts make an
identification impossible: (1) The titles ‘binkhén’ and Khitai are found nowhere
with Amir Saifuddin’s name. (2) He was not bought aa a slave by Shamsuddin as
thia malik is said to have been. (3) One of this malik’s sons is said to have died
by drowning in the Indus while with his father in a campaign near Multan. As
far as we know none of Khusrau’s brothers died during the life-time of hisfather. (4)
The author stops his narrative at the 15th year of Nagiruddin’s reign (658 H.)
which means that the malik must have died before that date, but Khusrau’s father,
aa we shall see, died about the year 660 nu. (See T.N., V. I. Text, p. 259.)

and married the daughter of ‘Imadul Mulk. Three sons were born to
him of this union: (1) ‘Izzuddin ‘Ali Shah, (2) Abul Hasan Khusrau, '
and (3) Husaémuddin Qutlugh.2 We do not know the date of birth of
either of his two brothers, but _Khusrau was born in the year 1253 a.p.
(651 B.) 2 t Patiyali® « according to several of his biographers, and the
date can easily be , verified by a reference to the various remarks the
poet makes about his own age in the course of his writings.“ Of the
three brothers the eldest was certainly ‘Izzuddin ‘Ali Shah, for according
to several authorities he succeeded his father in office on the latter's
death, and Khusrau’s own writings prove this to be a fact. It is
uncertain, however, which of the other two, Khusrau and Qutlugh,
was the younger. It seems probable that Qutlugh was the youngest,
for Khusrau speaks of him in a tender and loving strain® as behoves
an elder brother, while of his other brother ‘Izzuddin ‘Ali Shah he
always speaks with a certain amount of respect and veneration.

We do not know also whether Khusrau had any sisters, for the
Eastern biographers generally do not bother themselves about the female
relatives of a person: they are considered to be either too insignificant
to be mentioned or too sacred and inapproachable to be brought into the
glaring and unholy light of publicity, and unfortunately the poet himself
is also silent on this point.

Amir Mahmid, a true soldier and Turk, honest and simple, was
himself illiterate.6 Born of a race of warriors whose sole occupation,
probably, for centuries back had been the rearing of herds and tilling of
soil, who left their flock of sheep and goats, their simple rude cottages

1 Amir Khusrau’s full name has been given by some authorities as Abul
Hasan Yaminuddin Khusrau. The poet always gives his name only as Khusrau
or Sultani or Khusraw-i-Lachin, etc,

2 Qutlugh, meaning ‘ mubarak’ or auspicious in Turkish. Khusrau mentions
this name in ‘ Leyla and Majnin’, but in the lithographed edition it has been
corrupted into ai (see Majniin-o-Leyla, p. 61).

3 Curiously enough Walih Daghistani in hia Tezkira says that Amir Khusrau
came to India as a child with hia father. Khusrau’s own words in Nuh Sipihr are
a sufficient contradiction of this absurd statement. He says of India: ‘This
land, of all the world, is the place of my birth, my refuge, and my motherland ’.
(Nuh Sipihr, III, p. 43, seq.) «Gey 9 Glue 9 dye \Y cua

4 For instance in the Dibacha to Ghurrat-ul-Kamél he says: ‘From the year
685 when I was 34 years of age to the months ( 5s ) of 693 when I am 43 years
old... .’

5 See Majniin-o-Leylé, p. 61, and infra. See also Ode 35 (1.0. MS. 1187, fol.
1046 seq.), where he speaks of Husimuddin Qutlugh as the younger brother.

ontd their fields and ploughshares only to wield the lance, to ply the
bow and to manipulate the shield in hot and furious contests, it is not
strange that he should have been ignorant of those arts which are best
cultivated in the genial and fostering atmosphere of towns and cities,
where men congregate in their thousands to trade and work, to rule
and serve, to learn and instruct. Yet like a sensible man and a
thoughtful father, he could appreciate well the advantages accruing
from a knowledge of letters. He was now in India in the court of a
monarch whose throne was already surrounded by savants and scholars
fleecing from their homes and seeking shelter in India ; he was in a city ?
which was fast becoming the centre of a civilization and culture as high
and as potent as could be found in the ancient capitals of Bokhara or
Baghdad, Damascus or Cairo, and he could not but be affected by what
he saw around him. In his manifold duties as a courtier as well as
a soldier, he met daily great divines and jurists, big grammarians and
poets, and formed friendships with them. Perhaps he felt a little uneasy
about his own ignorance. Wisely he made up his mind to give the
best instruction possible to his sons, to train them not only in the arts
of war, but also in those of peace, to make them not only soldiers but
also scholars so that they may have the best opportunities of competing
with their contemporaries and of rising to positions to which a mere
soldier could never aspire.

( Khusrau seems to have been his special care, for the boy, truly a
precocious one, showed very early signs of a literary bent of mind, and
80, according to the poet himself, ‘ all his father’s ambition was focussed
on one thing, namely that the son should achieve literary proficiency.?
Of the other two sons, ‘Izzuddin ‘Ali Shah also later distinguished himself
as @ scholar,’ but Husimuddin seems to have been more inclined towards
the ancestral profession and after a preliminary course of instruction,
seems to have drifted more and more from the field of letters to that of
battle.‘ But we shall have occasion to speak of these two later on, and

1 Amir Mahniid settled in Patiyali, not far from Delhi and he lived, apparently,
mostly in Delhi, for it was there that Khusrau received his early training.

* Dibdcha Ghurrat-ul-Kamal: 5 Jad Joly oe Soy pore dT, Gur aes

8 Thus Khusrau mentions him as a great scholar of Arabic and Persian
in the Dib&cha Ghurrat-ul-Kamil.

‘4 This is evident from what Khusrau says of him in the passage in Majnin-o-
Leyla referred to above. He says: ‘In horsemanship like a bold faleom . . . he
knew full well the art of battle and the king gave him the title of Husim(uddin)
(=sword of the faith). In attack he was brave like his father, not like me whose
sword is broken. As he learnt so well the art of his father, he also betook himself
to hig land (i.e. the land of the dead or martyrs). He gave his life to the Pleasure
of his father’s soul, but all the sorrow fell on.my heart.’

shall for the present try to follow more closely the early years and
training of the poet.

Amir Mahmiid having determined to give his sons the full benefit
of education, such as it was understood to be in those times, arranged
for their instruction. In those days, as in much later times, in India
and other eastern countries, there were generally two courses that could
be adopted by a father desirous of educating his children. The young
children were either sent to one of the ‘maktabs’ or primary schools,
small unpretentious institutions situated generally in the precincts
of a mosque or a saint’s tomb, and presided over by the imam of the
mosque or some other venerable pedagogue of the neighbourhood, or,
if the father happened to be a well-to-do and prosperous man, he
engaged certain scholars to attend to his children’s education in their
own home. The preliminary training thus imparted generally consisted
of a knowledge of the Koran and theology, reading and writing of
Persian, a smattering of Arabic, some logic and grammar, and was
often supplemented by an instruction in some of the fine arts, chiefly
calligraphy and poetry. As the boy grew up, he could always find
opportunities, provided he had the will and the means, of augmenting
his knowledge either by attending the seances of literary men, where
scholars met and discussed the various sciences,! or by undergoing a
regular course of instruction in one of the colleges, or madrassas as they
were generally called ; or, in some cases, by devoting himself to an
assiduous study of the writings of old scholars, whose books, though
rare, could often be procured in manuscript form.

Amir Mahmiid, as we have already seen, was a fairly prosperous
man and could well afford to arrange for the best means of instructing
his children. Khusrau was sent to a maktab at a very early age and
some scholars were engaged to teach him at home also. The bright
boy made rapid progress with his studies, but he was born a poet and
had imbibed an extraordinary passion for poetry from his very cradle.
In fact, the tradition would have it that great achievements in that art
were promised to him from the time of his birth. It is said that when
he was born his father wrapped him up in a cloth and took him to a
saintly person so that the child might receive his blessings. No
sooner did the saint see the baby than he cried out: ‘O Amir

1 Thus Omar Khayyam says :
‘ Myself when young did eagerly frequent
Doctor and Saint and heard great Argument
About it and about :—but evermore
Came out by the same door as in I went.’ (Fitzgerald, XXVIT).

20

Mahmid, you have brought to me one who shall surpass Khaqgini
himself!’ 2

While, then, the teachers dinned into his ears the sonorous verses
of the Koran and the eternal bellicose transactions between the hypothe-
tical ‘Amr and Zaid, his young mind, sensitive to the beauties of nature
around him, roved far away to the land of imagination and fancy, and
his bright eyes wandered away from the dull pages of Panj-Ganj or
Hidaya to some small latticed window of the maktab through which he
could see the green trees, the blue Indian sky, the birds hopping about
and filling the air with their melodious twitterings.

Of these early days the poet says himself :* ‘My father used to
send me to the ‘‘ maktab ” for study, but I repeated only rhymes, and

tay learned teacher S‘aduddin Mohd., the calligraphist, popularly
known as the Qadi (God’s mercy be upon him), tried to teach me calli-
graphy, while I composed verses about the silken down on fair faces.®
In spite of the persistent efforts of my teacher, continuous and long like
the tresses descending from head to foot on the back of a beauty, I
would not renounce my infatuation for the locks and the mole.* As a
consequence, at that tender age I began to compose verses and ghazals
that roused the admiration and wonder of my elders.’

Finding all efforts to divert the pupil’s mind from poetry fruitless,
and in the course of time recognizing his great genius and extraordinary
aptitude for it, the teachers seem to have not only let him have his
own way, but to have actually encouraged him. They felt a reasonable
pride in the prodigious genius of their young charge, very common in
old days when the teacher looked upon his pupil as his own son ; when
the relations between the two were far closer and more affectionate
than in these days, and when the teacher regarded the fame and renown
of his pupil as reflecting glory and shedding a lustre upon himself.
Khusrau soon became their favourite. The boy was petted and
encouraged. He was held up as a prodigy before the astonished eyes of
savants and doctors, and accompanied his teachers in their visits to

1 The story has been related by Firishta and other biographers. It is probably
a myth and I give it for what it is worth. But essentially there is nothing impossible .
about it. Even to-day children are taken in India to saints or even to their tombs.
Some mothers would even take their new-born babes to such parents as have been:
fortunate in their progeny, and lay them at their feet, seeking thereby a happiness, °
similar to theirs, in their own offspring. :

literary gatherings and the houses of the nobles. Thus happened an
incident that the poet describes in his own words...

‘One morning Khwaja Asil, ‘the Kotwal, sent for my teacher
(Khwija Asaduddin) to have a letter composed by him. My humble
self and my respected teacher, together with the ink-pot and the pen-
case, reached the house (of the Kotwal). In the house of that honoured
personage happened to be living in those days Khwaja ‘Izzuddin, a
great scholar who possessed a good knowledge of poetry also. As we
reached there, the Khwaja held in his hand a book of verses 2 and was
busy in its perusal. He was bringing out from its depths the bright
pearls and glittering gems (of poesy) for the behoof of his audience.
My teacher said to him: ‘ This small boy, my pupil, soars high to the
very stars in his (poetic) skill : let him recite a verse or two. Give him the
book and let us mark carefully how he manages to recite the verses
therein.”” Khwaja ‘Izzuddin handed the book to me and I began to
read out. I recited each verse in a tremulous and modulated accent, so
that my melodious recital rendered all eyes tearful, and astonishment
surged on all sides. My teacher then said : ‘ The recitation of verses is
easy(?). He should be tested with the composition of a verse in order
that his natural brilliance may shine out like a mirror.’ Khwaja
‘Izzuddin, thereupon, tested me with four discordant things, namely
hair, egg, arrow, and melon.’ In the presence of all the people in the
assembly, there and then I composed the following verses : 4»

ee“ Every hair in the tresses of that beauty has attached to it a
thousand ‘eggs’ (ie. grains) of amber. But do not consider her
nature to be as straight as an arrow, for like the melon the teeth (ie.
the seeds ) are concealed within.” *

‘When I recited this quatrain the Khwaja praised me abundantly
and asked me my name. I told him it was Khusrau. Then he asked

1 Dibacha of Tuhfat-us-Sighar.

2 Probably a ‘ biyad’ or a manuscript collection of verses by various masters.
Such collections were very popular in India till recent days, and most of the literary
men or others fond of poetry, possessed a ‘biyéd’ with selections from their
favourite poets.

3 That is, asked him to compose verses wherein these four things with no
apparent connection should be appropriately mentioned. This was a popular
method of testing poetic skill. Another way was to ask one to complete aptly a
verse, given the first line, or a quatrain whose three lines had been composed by
some other poet or poets. See, for instance, the story related about Firdausi
who was tested by the eminent poets of his age. (Browne: Lit. Hist. of Persia,
II, 129). :

me the name of my father and I gave it ss Sultani-i-Shamsi. Then he
spoke out thus: “As thy father’s name is linked with kings, thy pen-
name also should be Sulténi . . . . for therein lies a good augury. No
poet, however well he may have established his sway (in the realm of
poetry), has achieved anything worth more than a ‘dirhem’. A Sultani
in our days, however, is worth two dirhems,! and you may rest well
assured that your fame in the land of. poesy will reach so high that
you will be appreciated and valued by men twice as much as other
poets ”.’

This was perhaps the first public appearance of the budding poet,
his first step towards that wide fame which he was destined to achieve,
and was the first pledge and token of that appreciation and homage
that he was to receive from successive generations of admirers. We
can well imagine him returning home with an exultant heart, a light
foot, and a glowing eye, to narrate the whole event with modest pride
to his brothers and parents.

The boy was now firmly set on the path of poetry and he proceeded
with vigour apace. But very soon he had to face the first great sorrow
of his life. His fond father, always so solicitous for his welfare and
education, met his death in one of those numerous campaigns in which
he was so often engaged, and in Khusrau’s words, ‘ gave up his life to
drink the bitter draught of martyrdom so sweet to his taste, and to
quaff the goblet of immortality promised in the verse: ‘Nay, they are
alive and by their Lord”’.’® His father thus left him an orphan of eight
years. He naturally felt the loss heavily and thus laments his father’s
demise :

‘Saif passed away from me, leaving my heart cleft in two. The
tears roll down like a flood from my eyes and I remain like a solitary
pearl.’ ¢

His father, however, by his care and concern, had already engrafted
in his young mind the value and importance of learning, and when the

boy had become an old man and his fame had ‘ seized the four quarters
of the globe’, he could not but acknowledge with a fond and sad
gratitude : ‘In my clay is the seed planted by him, and it is now
blooming forth.’ }

Of his poetical achievements at that early age, he says: ‘I was
then eight years old, but in my swift poetic flights I trod upon the
celestial spheres. In that tender age when my milk-teeth were falling,
I composed verses that dropped from my mouth like bright pearls.’ ?

Khusrau’s father died about the year 6594.2 Shamsuddin Iltiitmish
was long dead by this time and his youngest son, Nasiruddin Mahmid,
was on the throne of Delhi. Kings had come and gone in quick succes-
sion after the powerful Slave Sultan’s death, and the country almost
up to the year 644 H. was more or less in a state of anarchy.‘ |

Shamsuddin’s eldest son, Nasiruddin Mahmiid (the Elder), was a
brave, generous and capable prince, and had achieved great renown
during the lifetime of his father by his successful campaigns in Oudh,
where he conquered and killed a powerful Hindu chief, Barta, and in
Lakhnauti against Ghiyathuddin ‘Iwad Khalji, whom he also defeated
and put to death. He would perhaps have proved an able and strong
successor to his father, but he died during the latter’s lifetime, and so
Ruknuddin Firiz Shah, the secdnd son of Iltitmish, came to the throne
in 633 H. He was a weak and dissolute man, given to wine and women,
and squandered his father’s treasures,° leaving the government of the
country to his mother, Shah-i-Turkan,® a Turkish slave-girl. Shah-i-
Turkan’s jealousy prompted her to perpetrate several cruel outrages on
her rivals, the other wives of Iltatmish, and her step-children. This
roused wide-spread indignation, and nobles and governors all over the
country rose in open rebellion. The governors of Multan, Lahore, and
Badaon joined forces and marched towards the capital. As the king
marched out to meet them, the citizens of Delhi, enraged by his mother’s
doings, and especially her attempt to put to death Radiya, the favourite

Tabaqgat-i-Nasiri.

5 Khusrau says of him (‘Ashiqa 8.0.8. MS., pp. 56-57): ‘He emptied all the

daughter of Iltitmish, rebelled, and captured the queen. All the Turkish
chiefs then agreed to enthrone Sultana Radiya, who became the first and
last queen of Delhi in 634 8. Ruknuddin was imprisoned, and soon after
died in captivity.

Radiya, a brave and capable queen, who rode on elephant and
horse-back in male attire, to the scandal of the religious bigots, exercised
a good deal of power and influence even during the reign of her father,
who is said to have nominated her as his successor in spite of the protests
of his nobles. She ruled the country well, and managed to subdue the
grumbling and discontented Turkish chiefs and to restore order in such
provinces as Rantambhur and Gwaliyar. But her partiality to an
Abbyssinian, Amir Yaqit, estranged several Turkish chiefs. Amir
Mahmid Altiiniya,! the governor of Tabarhinda, marched on Delhi and
captured the queen. She later married her captor, and together they
advanced towards Delhi to regain the throne which had already been
occupied by her brother Mu‘izuddin Bahram Shah, but they were de-
feated. Deserted by their followers after the defeat, they fell into the
hands of Hindu jits who murdered them.”

Sultan Mu‘izuddin Bahriém Shah, who was crowned king in 637 H.,
was cruel and hard-hearted, although very simple and unassuming in
his manner and dress. His tyranny arid ill-treatment of high officials
made all the nobles suspicious of him. They joined together against
him, revolted in Delhi in 639, and put the king to death. The unfortunate
prince’s brief reign was also miarred by the capture and destruction of
Lahore at the hands of the Mongols in 639, and the wholesale slaughter
of its inhabitants.’

Mu‘izuddin was succeeded in 639 H. by Ruknuddin Firiiz Shah’s
son, Ala‘uddin Mas‘iid Shah, a generous, virtuous, and accomplished
prince who started his reign well by releasing from confinement his
uncles Nasiruddin and Malik Jalaluddin, and winning the confidence of
his. nobles. The Mongols, who invaded India twice in his time, were -
successfully repulsed. But a change soon came over him. He became

after Shamsuddin’s death were due to the rivalries and ambitions of these. Turks,

2 Khusrau is full of admiration for the unfortunate queen. ‘The good-natured
daughter Radiya decorated the throne ... For some months her sun-like face
was concealed in the cloud of the veil... but as many affairs could not thua
be properly dealt with, she discarded the veil. Her might and prowess compelled
brave men to bow before her. For three yeara, when her furtune was in the as-
cendant, no one could find any fault with her...’ (8.0.8. MS. of ‘Ashiga,
pp. 56-57).

of pleasure like Behram of yore.’ -- oe

more and more inclined towards pleasures of the wine-cup and the chase,
lost his old good qualities, and neglected state affairs. The nobles,
conspiring against him, imprisoned the king and called upon Nasiruddin
Mahmid, the youngest son of Iltiitmish, to assume the reins of government.

Sultan Nagiruddin Mahmid was proclaimed king in the beginning
of the year 646 H. Pious and virtuous, gentle and meek, simple and
unassuming, Nasiruddin ruled for twenty-two years with unique success,
thanks chiefly to his able lieutenant Ghiyaéthuddin Balban who, with the
titles of Ulugh Qutlugh Khan, was the real power behind the king.
Balban fought the Mongols for his master, leading expeditions against
them every year, and restored order and peace in the frontier provinces
by effectively barring the inroads of the Mongols and supplying the
fortresses with strong garrisons. He subjugated the refractory Indian
princes and thus gave to the kingdom a strength and a unity that it had
not seen since the time of Iltitmish. The king himself, meanwhile,
passed his life in piety and simplicity. His wife cooked for him, while
he copied the Koran, calligraphy being a favourite hobby of his, or
busied himself in the study of books. Balban continued to serve his
master during the latter’s long reign and piloted the state safely through
rebellions, conspiracies, and the Mongol menace till the year 1266 a.p.,
when Nagiruddin died a peaceful death.! During this long time Balban
had never swerved from the path of loyalty, and with his tact and ability
had won for himself a high repute, so that when on his master’s death,
he assumed the royal black canopy? nobody grumbled or dared raise
a Voice against him.

Ghiyathuddin Balban, a slave and compatriot of Iltitmish, was
descended from the princely house of Albari® Turks. It is related
that he was short and ugly and that Shamsuddin at first refused to buy
him when he was brought to him with other slaves. ‘For whose sake
have you bought all these slaves ?’ asked Balban of the Sultan. ‘For
mine own, of course’, replied the king. ‘Then buy me for the sake of
God!’ appealed Balban. The king was amused and touched.* He
bought the slave, who very soon proved by his mettle and prowess
that the king had not made a bad bargain. He was enrolled subse-

1 Ibn Battiitta’s assertion that Balban murdered his master is unsupported
by any other evidence.

2 The Turkish Sultans of Delhi apparently borrowed black as the emblem of
royalty from the Abbasid Caliphs, for ‘ chatri-siyah ’’ was among them the special
emblem of royalty. See infra.

3 Or Ilbart, a tribe of Turkestan. See Raverty, T. N. (Tr. p. 800 n.). It would
appear from his notes that Iltitmish also belonged to the same tribe. Sir D. Ross
has suggested that the name Albari is a compound word Alp-ari=a brave man
(Alp=brave ; ar=man. Turk). :

quently in the famous corps of ‘the forty’ and rose to high positions.
Ilttitmish’s daughter, Sultina Radiya, made him her chief huntsman.
Later he began his brilliant campaigns against the Mongols and it was
due mainly to his organization and skill that they were defeated and
repulsed in the reign of ‘Alauddin Mas‘id Shah.

When, therefore, in 664 H., the strong and experienced man took in
his hands the reins of the kingdom, ‘ the capital of Delhi acquired lustre
and brilliatce, state-affairs and the welfare of the kingdom were properly
attended to ; his reign gave a fresh strength to the kingdom and matters
that had weakened and got disturbed and confused were put under
due control again. With his strong laws and his sound opinion he
brought the multitude as well as the elite of the country under his
subjection, and his majesty and might were deeply impressed on their
mind. Through his abundant justice and mercifulness, he made all
his subjects attached to his Government, and the people who, during
the thirty years after the death of Sultan Shamsuddin Iltitmish, on
account of the inexperience and folly of his children and the usurpation
of power by the ill-advised Shamsi slaves, had become disobedient and
self-willed, perching on every twig, and creeping under the protecting
wings of any pretender, living as they pleased and losing all respect
for kingly prestige, so essential for the peace and order of the world,
became submissive and obedient from the very first year of Balban’s
reign. They renounced their truculent attitude and selfish ways, and
gave up their heedlessness and insolence ’.?

So writes Barni, and we may well understand this change in the
attitude of the people, for it is certain that the old monarch ruled with
an iron hand, wisely and justly no doubt, but at the same time with
a sternness that in some cases bordered on cruelty 2—that was, perhaps,
essential for those disturbed times. He was very particular about the
selection of his officials, and gave all responsible posts to men of noble
descent, experienced and faithful, generous and brave, and ‘to any
worthless, idle, miserly, and greedy man he never gave any high office ’.
He had the greatest concern for the splendour of his official life, for
he thought it to be very important in establishing the royal prestige.

swords on their shoulders used to escort him, and when the king rode
in a cavalcade his bright face shone and the naked swords glittered.
With the brightness of the sun, the flash of the swords, and the brilliance
of his face, the charm (of the cavalcade) was enhanced a hundredfold.
The eyes of the onlookers filled with tears and were dazzled, and they
talked of this sight in wonder and admiration’. Of his durbar he says :
‘In his general durbar there stood in order the wardens,’ the chamber-
lains,2_ the armour-bearers,® the guards,* the ‘sahm-ul-hashams ’,®
and their lieutenants, the ‘ chaushes ’,® the ‘ naqibs ’, gnd the ‘ pahlwans ’,
while on right and left were stationed elephants and caparisoned horses.
The king with his face bright as the sun and his white beard like
camphor, sat on the ornamented throne with an air and a pose that
made all hearts tremble. There stood behind the throne the special
servants and confidants,’ while the ‘shahnas’ of elephants ® ‘ sarjan-
dars ’ and chief armour-bearers, the masters of the stable and the amirs
of the slaves, stood right and left, and their subordinates also stood there
according to their ranks. The cries of the ‘sahmul-hashams’ and
‘ chaushes, and the shouts of the ‘ naqibs ’ could be heard from a distance
of two kurohs ® and those who heard them quaked with fear. If in the
court there happened to be ambassadors from far-off places, ‘ rais’, or
‘raizadas’, or other chiefs coming to pay homage to the king, they
most often fainted and collapsed ’.

In splendour and majesty Balban surpassed even his master
Shamsuddin Iltitmish, and although his harsh discipline and stern
gravity could not tolerate the presence of a musician or a jester in his
court, he often held big and splendid assemblies wherein were found
figured carpets, coloured dishes, gold and silver vessels, gold-embroidered
screens, foliage and flower decorations, various kinds of fruit and dishes,
sherbets and tanbil (i.e. betel-leaf), and where music was played and

poets recited panegyrics. He was very fond of wine when he was a
malik and a kban, but he renounced it on becoming king.

The splendour of his reign was enhanced by the existence in those
days of several great and knightly maliks, ‘the wonders’ as Barni
calls them, great scholars and poets, skilful musicians and physicians,
expert artisans and craftsmen.

Foremost among the maliks was ‘Alauddin Kishlikhan, Ullugh
Qutlugh Mubarak Barbek,? the nephew of the Sultan, who was famed
far and wide for hig generosity and had ‘surpassed even Hatam Tayy
in his munificence’. Poets and musicians came to him from the farthest
corners of the country and got rich rewards for singing his praises. He
was at the same time the foremost man of his time in playing polo and
in hunting, so that his fame spread even to countries beyond Khorasan,
and it is said that Hulagu himself was so impressed by what he heard
about him that he invited him to his court and promised to give him
half of Iraq if he came there, and that his uncle was not a little jealous
of the nephew’s wide popularity and renown.’ He held the office of
Chief Chamberlain to the king and was often, in consequence, styled
‘the great Barbek ’.

Another great malik was Malik-ul-Umara, Fakbruddin, the Kotwal *
of Delhi, who was noted for his deeds of piety and charity. It is related
of him that he kept constantly engaged twelve thousand men to recite
the Koran, changed his dress on each of the three hundred and sixty
days of the year giving away the discarded one to poor and needy people,
and even his bedstead and bed-sheets were changed every day. Each
year he provided dowries for a thousand poor maidens.®

Amir ‘Ali, sarjandar, the cousin of Balban, known as Hatém Khan
on account of his generosity, was another of the prominent maliks, whose
gifts never fell short of thousands. He was a great devotee of the wine-
cup and bestowed lavish gifts when under its influence. Balban once
said to him : ‘ O ‘Ali, I hear you bestow “ something ” while intoxicated
in your wine-parties. I should consider you to be generous only if

as Kushlikhan, but nowhere Kushilkhan as Prof. Habib writes (Life and Works,
p. 6). See T. N. Ulugh, Qutlugh are simply titles. Barbek is the Turkish synonym
of Amir-Hajib (Chief Chamberlain). In Rieu (Pers. MSS. V. I, c. 240) the name
is given aa Kishli Khén Jumhir, the second being probably a corruption of Jhiajii
or Chijji, a title of this malik, and he is described as the brother of Sultan
Ghiyathuddin.

you give anything when you are sober’. From that day the Khan
renounced wine and his gifts became more lavish.!

And ariong the maliks was ‘Imadul-Mulk, the maternal grandfather
of Khusrau, now the Rawat-‘Ard.2_ He had held for thirty years the
onerous post of ‘Ard-i-Mamalik, and even now, though nominally in
charge of the royal horse, he carried on the functions of ‘ard-i-mamalik
also. As Khusrau says: ‘ He was one of the four props of the throne,
and although he had no regal insignia, he held the emblems of authority.‘
With his wide generosity he held the whole of Hindustan in the palm
of his hand and did the real work of Government from behind the screen,
contenting himself ostensibly with the office of an ‘Arid so that the
jealous mischief-makers may raise no trouble. Wonderful rawat-‘ard
who, in managing the affairs of the whole Indian kingdom, displayed
such sound opinion that whenever he desired he could reverse a ‘rai’
and make him a ‘ yar’ (friend) -’ 5

The duties of the rawat-‘ard, as far as we can gather from con-
temporary narratives, were primarily the supervision of the cavalry
which formed the bulk of the regular army in those days, and the
examination from time to time of the horses and equipments of the

1 Tbid., pp. 118-119.

2 A curious appellation. Rawat, riut in Marahti and ‘ravat’ in Gujrati,
means a horse-soldier, a trooper, a horse-keeper. Rawat-‘ard, then, is equivalent
to ‘Arid-i-Rawat or ‘Arid-i-Sipah, as Khusrau designates him in one place, and
‘Arid (from ‘Ard) means one who presents, hence supervises and controls. But it
is not clear why ‘Arid-i-Rawat should be changed into Rawat-‘ard by Barni. ‘Ard
could, of course, denote the name of the post of an ‘Arid or of his office (diwan)
but not the officer himself. Perhaps it is a case of transposed idafat, ‘aridi-rawat
being changed into Rawat-Arid and the second word being shortened into ‘Ard.
Or it may be the Turkish form Rawat-Aridi which has been contracted into
rawat‘-ard.

The poet evidently means that he could win any refractory rai over to his side
with his sound policy, playing upon the double meaning of the word gly. It is

interesting to note here that ‘Im&dul-Mulk himself was probably of Indian origin,

soldiers. He did his work with great energy and honesty, and ,with an
almost paternal generosity. He would increase the stipends of any
cavalier whom he found well-equipped at the time of the terminal
parades and reward him handsomely. If a cavalier happened to lose
his horse through an accident, he would console him and help him to
buy another, or would give him one from his own stable. If he found
a horse ill-fed and was satisfied that its master could not afford to feed
it properly, he would change it for a strong, stout horse of his own or
give the man a large sum of money for the proper maintenance of the horse.

Annually he used to invite all the officials of the ‘Ard-diwan to a
grand and sumptuous feast and bestowed on them rich dresses. He
supplied from his own kitchen food for all his subordinates. Fifty to
sixty trays heaped with white bread, roast mutton, pigeons, chickens,
and other viands, with liqueurs,’ sherbets, and betels, were served at
each meal in the diwan-i-‘ard and according to Khusrau, ‘the corner
of his tablecloth stretched up to the skirts of the Resurrection itself.’ ?
The ‘tanbil’*® of rawat-‘ard was specially noted for its excellence and
abundance and ‘the poor people received from him “ tanbil” larger
in quantity than all the vegetation on earth’. The Rawat‘ard who had
a great partiality for this leaf would send for it in quick succession,®
and each time he took one for himself, all those who happened to be
sitting around him also got one each. His generosity extended even
beyond this. ‘Each year he gave away caps and cloaks numerous
enough to cover the nakedness of all the needy persons in the world.
Every time this ‘arid of the armies® poured the rain of his mercy on
the Musalmans, the Hindu unbelievers also received their due, for the
rain was general, only the rain that fell on the latter was that of arrows
and spears ’.” ,

feigned. In fact the last clause would seem to be an afterthought added to deceive
his too ardent Muslim readers.

It was this great man, this ‘ pillar of the state’, who became the
guardian of Kbursau after the death of Amir Saifuddin Mahmid. It.
was lucky for the young poet that his grandfather was there to take
care of him, and he says himself: ‘My fortune favoured me, for my
grandfather was alive. He was not a mere grandfather, but a great.
fortune. When the cloud whose drop I am passed away from my
head, I was left an orphan. My grandfather picked me up and strung
me in the pearl-rope of his service ’.?

‘Imadul-Mulk, as we have seen above, was one of the foremost
nobles of his age. He had in his personal service two hundred Turkish
and two thousand Hindu slaves and servants and a thousand troopers.®
Fifty to sixty slaves always attended his assemblies for bringing in
fresh relays of betel-leaf alone,* and his house was the haunt of great
scholars and mighty nobles. The young poet thus grew up amidst
luxury and ease and passed his youthful days in the society of great
men. He listened eagerly to the learned discourses of the scholars, the
artistic recitals of the poets, and the melodious songs of the musicians,
and found ample opportunity for exercising his own poetic talent by
writing poems in praise of his grandfather’s distinguished guests. It
was also probably in these early days, in the magnificent assemblies
convened by ‘Imadul-Mulk, that the poet imbibed a love for music, a
science in which he later acquired great proficiency.

But while Khusrau was thus making great headway in his favourite
pursuits, it is uncertain whether he paid as much attention to the more
abstruse sciences. There is no evidence to show that he underwent
any regular course of training in some of the colleges, or that he was
instructed by any contemporary scholars. The only teacher of his
whom he has mentioned by name is the calligraphsit Khwaja Asaduddin ©
who was apparently responsible for the elementary training of the poet

5 See supra. We know nothing more about him than that he was a good
ealligraphiat. But his soubriquet of Qadi would show that he was also a good
scholar. Barni mentions, among the learned men of Balban’s time, a certain Qadi
Sa‘iduddin (p. 111) and it is possible that this is a mistake for Asaduddin. Of
his skill in calligraphy Khusrau says in an ode:

in the popular art of calligraphy. Even in poetry he did not adopt the
‘usual procedure of becoming a pupil to some famous master, but relied
almost entirely on his own skill and natural aptitude. He studied
assiduously the poetry of popular masters of his day and tried his hand
at each of the various styles then commonly in vogue, but he sought

no aid, no correction !, as it was technically known, from anyone. He

says himself:? ‘I was only twelve years old when the foundations

of the various forms of verse were laid strongly in my mind. When the

scholars and savants of the time saw my proficiency in poetry they

were amazed and their amazement added to my pride, for on listening
to my verses they used to encourage me heartily. But I hardly required

any such encouragement, for I was already so enamoured of this

fascinating art that from morning till evening my head was bent like |
that of the pen consuming the lampsoot,’ and I strained my eyes over
“the black and white ” day and night in order to achieve a high name

for fine sagacity and enlightened wit. From time to time the con-

temporary artists used to test my skill* and I displayed to them my

art with the burning eloquence of my tongue. As no famous master
had ever trained me, who could point out to me the subtléties of verse

and could check my wandering pen from the paths of error or help to

bring to light the excellence that lay hidden in my faults, for some

time I placed before me, like the parrots learning to speak, the mirror

of imagination, and learnt poetry from the images that were reflected

in that mirror. I sought at the same time to polish the rough mirror of

my mind with the burnisher of efforts. I examined most of the (forms of

poetry) that could be produced through imagination, and studied con-

stantly the works of great masters. From these I culled what was

sweet and thus acquired a real taste for the pleasures of poetry. My

eyes and intellect brightened when I saw the writings of Anwari and

Sandi, and wherever I beheld a poem bright as gold-water I chased it

like a running stream. Every diwan I came across, I not only studied

but imitated in my compositions.’ 5

This shows clearly that Khusrau from the very beginning of his
poetical career relied almost entirely on his own natural genius and
industry and did not seek the aid of any of the brilliant scholars and
poets who, according to Barni, adorned the reign of Ghiyathuddin Balban.?
He was, no doubt, conscious of the advantages accruing from a regular
training under a sympathetic master who could check the wayward
flights of a youthful fancy to paths of error, and direct the course of an
unripe and ardent imagination into proper and fruitful channels, for
poetry in the East has always been a science as well as an art, and as
such requires often a regular instruction. Thus the poet himself, advising
one of his sons, says: ‘If you want to be happy in your manhood,
you should serve well your teacher. What use is it to grasp the axe
in your hand without the guidance of a teacher ? Surely your hand, will
become wood and the wood fuel. Rose-water pressed from wild roses
does not smell so pleasantly’. Yet there are certain natures that cannot
bear even the gentle yoke of pupilhood, certain minds that would not
be trammelled by conventions, and certain dispositions that have in
them a seed of originality and independence. Genius always soars
high above the usual rules and conventions, and strives to chalk out for
itself a path different from that of the average human being. Khusrau,
no doubt, in his early days tried to imitate great masters,’ and even in
his riper age strove to plod in the footprints of Nizémi,* but his native
originality and genius always assert themselves in his works and have
helped him to evolve a style of poetry that is essentially his own.

Khusrau does not seem to have paid much attention to the study of
serious sciences in his youth. He says that he knew several languages, §
and we have no reason to disbelieve him. But these languages, we
suspect to have been acquired more through an everyday intercourse
with all sorts of men—Hindu rais coming to court the favour of his

know very little naw. According to Shibli (Shi‘rul ‘Ajam, V. II, p. 144) Khusrau
became a pupil of. Maulana Shihabuddin. But this is an erroneous conclusion
from some of the poet's remarks about this personage.

grandfather, the burly Afghans of the frontier whom he met in his travels
to Multan and other places in the west, and the Turks of the north
(Balai) who came to seek employment as troopers in the armies of the
king of Delhi—than from a regular study. He admits himself that he
was not a scholar of Arabic. ‘I am an Indian Turk and can answer
you in Hindi; I have no Egyptian sugar.(ie. Arabic) to talk of
Arabia ’.1 ;

He even confesses that he did not know the ‘ silly ’ rules of prosody,
the various metres, the scansions, the numerous changes that the rhyme
undergoes, and so on.2 He probably gained a fairly good knowledge of
sciences like astronomy, grammar, theology, and jurisprudence during
his visits to the assemblies of the learned and through a frequent associa-
tion with scholars. This is evident from his works. Yet he was a poet
first and anything else after that. He was not a ‘ scholar-poet ’,—his
poetry was not the outcome of a thorough study and mastery of a
language without any real poetic genius. He did not compose poems
as a writer would compose an ornate letter, plodding slowly, stumbling
at each word, and weighing and judging it carefully before ‘ stringing
it finally into the necklace’. He was a bright boy with an intellect
and shrewdness certainly extraordinary. He grasped quickly what he
heard and stored it in his memory, and thus without any elaborate
study managed to learn a good deal. He could always make up for his
rather cursory knowledge of sciences by his quick wit and brilliant
intellect, and could hold his own against any pedantic scholar.

The young poet, then, started his public career equipped with just
a passable knowledge of the serious sciences, but with an extraordinary
talent for poetry, a keen appreciation of things beautiful and pleasant
and, above all, a ready wit and a bright humour that won for him an

believe in the face of Khusrau’s own denial.

and you place (your verses) in the balance. Which of us two is superior ? Consider

honourable place in any assembly. He was born a courtier just as he
was born a poet, and he continued playing the double réle almost up
to the very last moments of his life. His poems charmed the populace
and entranced nobles and princes. It would be no exaggeration to say
in the words of Sleeman, that he ‘ sang extempore to his lyre while the
greatest and the fairest watched his lips to catch the expressions as
they came warm from his soul’. The eloquence and sweetness of his
verses soon earned for him the title of Tiati-i-Hind, the Parrot of India.?

Fortune favoured the youthful artist from the very start. The
peculiar combination of a gifted poet and a pleasant and shrewd courtier
and man of the world threw all doors open before him. The conditions
of the country, moreover, during Balban’s reign, and that of the society
were ideal for a successful début. Peace prevailed generally throughout
the country, and men thought more of poetry and learning than of
warlike exploits. On the one hand there was a brilliant galaxy of
scholars and savants that came in ever larger numbers from the north
to the hospitable capital of Delhi, and on the other an equally resplendent
group of great and generous maliks, the remnants of the famous Shamsi
slaves, who vied with one another in their lavish gifts to men of letters
and poets, in order to earn for themselves a distinction among their
companions and a name that might be handed down to posterity through
the panegyrics that their generosity obtained for them. Thus Barni says: 8
‘There was no rivalry, jealousy or enmity among the Shamsi, Nasiri
or even Balbani maliks and kbans for the sake of big fiefs, abundance of
wealth, or high and honourable offices. All their rivalry and envy was
concerning deeds of generosity. If a khan or malik heard that five
hundred persons dined at the table of a certain malik or kban, he was
envious and tried to feed a thousand at his table. Again, if one of them
came to know that such and such malik gives as charity two hundred

‘“‘ tankahs ’’! when he rides out, he was jealous and determined to give
away four hundred “ tankahs” when he himself rode out. If one of the
nobles bestowed fifty horses in his wine-party and gave robes to two
hundred persons, another noble hearing this would feel jealous and would
try his best to give away a hundred horses and to bestow robes on five
hundred persons. Consequently, the maliks, the Khans, and the nobles
of that age were always in debt on account of their lavish gifts,
expenditure, and charities.’

Several of these nobles, one may believe, were eager to patronise a
rising star like Khusrau and to secure his services for their special behoof.
Khusrau was too young to be admitted to the royal court itself, and,
perhaps, the stern monarch (whom Khusrau praises in several fine
odes) 2 was not much inclined towards poetry and poets, and so the poet
had to attach himself to one of the nobles. His choice fell on the fore-
most and the most generous of them, and he enrolled himself in the
cortége of the brilliant Malik Jhujhu, ‘Alauddin Kishli Khan, the Chief
Chamberlain,®? who once gave away all the horses in his stables to a
poet, Shamsi-i-Mu‘in, who had composed an ode in his praise and ten
thousand tankahs to each of the musicians who recited the ode in his
presence. But it was not until after the death of his grandfather,
‘Imadul Mulk, who died at the ripe age of a hundred and thirteen years,
after a long and meritorious service of about seventy years as the ‘arid-i-
mamalik, that Khusrau sought the protection of this malik. This event
occurred about the year 671 H.,5 when the poet was almost twenty
and had firmly established his claims to be a poet of the first rank.
Great scholars had already testified to his skill, and already he had -
produced enough poetry to form a large diwan.® He relates of himself
when he was sixteen : ‘ In those days critical people had changed their ideas

(1.0. MS., No. 1187).

5 Khusrau gives, in his Dibaécha to the Ghurrat-ul-Kamal, the age and duration
of office of his grandfather. He says further on, however, ‘I was 20 when he
became s hundred and traversed in a moment the thousand-year long journey to
paradise’. (But he is evidently giving here the approximate age of ‘Imad-ul-
Mulk and is speaking, as it were, in round numbers. Khusrau was born in 651
w., and so ‘Imad-ul-Mulk must have died about 671 H. Ahmad Said Mahrarawi
commits the strange blunder of asserting that ‘Im&d-ul-Mulk was 113 when he took
charge of Khusrau after the death of the latter’s father. (See Hayat-i-Khuarau,
p. 6.)

16 to 19 years. (See Dibacha.)

about the expression of thoughts and the new style in great vogue was
the style of Kamal of Ispahan.1 Following the general practice, I also
adopted the same mode and little by little achieved great proficiency in
it. Mufti Mush‘iruddin Gharifi? was alive then, and in learning and
knowledge was unique in his time. One day I betook myself to this
great scholar in order to gain and profit by his advice concerning this
style, and recited to him a fine quatrain that I had recently composed,
and which began thus: ‘“ When thy languid eye is conquettish at the
time thou smilest, roses seem to be falling about from thy face”.® The
Mufti* liked it immensely and praised me highly .... Afterwards
whatever my youthful imagination produced, was eagerly sought and
appreciated by the knowing persons of the time and was quoted from
mouth to mouth, musicians sang it to the music of their lyres, and even
bent old men flew into ecstasies on hearing these melodies.’ 5

While, then, the poet was exulting in his successes and was boasting
of his poetic prowess, saying, ‘My verses have imparted to the realm
of Hind a splendour as Zahir’s verses did to that of Faryab’,® and,
‘My dust has been made the collyrium of Ispahan so that the sky may
apply it to the eyes of Anwari,’’” he had to face this fresh sorrow, ‘Im&d-ul
Mulk’s death. Khusrau composed a long and touching elegy on the
death of this affectionate grandfather, who had been so kind to the
orphan. He mourned him with real grief. ‘That lamp is blown out
the Torch of Heaven is obscured. Alas! the foundation of the two
worlds is ruined. Why does not the ‘Arid go to the royal presence ?
Where hides the great minister and why comes he not to the Diwan !
.... O Asaf! even the Sultan weeps for thee and O ‘Arid, the diwin
itself mourns thy death. The supporting pole (pillar) of the celestial
dome itself has succumbed, for pavilions and belvederes of the royal
palace are in mourning.... The Turks have discarded their ‘‘kulihs”’,
and in grief have rent their cloaks down to the skirt, while the Hindu
Rais, with bare heads like Brahmins, weep in bewildered sorrow.’ ®

The poet as noted above now made the wise decision of entering the
service of Malik ‘Alduddin Kishli Khan, one of his earliest patrons.
He had, by this time, sung the praises of several contemporary great
men, among them being Shamsuddin Dabir,! Amir ‘Ali Sarjandar®
Ikbtiyaruddavla Husimuddin, and Malik Mahmiid, the son and successor
of ‘Imad-ul-Mulk.2 But ‘Alauddin Kishli Khan, both in generosity and
rank, certainly excelled all his contemporaries. His power and influence
as the nephew of the Sultan were vast, and his assemblies were attended
by nobles and princes of the highest position, and the young poet could
not have made a better choice. He says himself: ‘ After that (ie.
the death of ‘ImAd-ul-Mulk) I attached myself to the court of the great
Kishli Khan, known popularly as Jhujhi, and through this wise attach-
ment reached to great and lofty heights. Soon after I had entered his
service, I became his great confident.’ 4

What the duties of the poet were in his first office, and what
remuneration he received for performing them, we cannot definitely
ascertain. But we can guess with great probability of truth, that his
main duty was to enliven the assemblies of his patron with his ready
wit and pleasant humour, to be, in other words, a boon-companion to
the great Khan, and to sing his praises in fine poems that might shed
an enhanced lustre on his already prominent personality.

‘For two years’, says Khusrau, ‘I sang his praises in some of the
most ornate odes, one of which others could compose only in a year 5 (?).
I was constantly present in the garden of that cypress® and refreshed
his court with the soft breezes that blew from the lily of my tongue.’?

The assemblies of these great khans were, as we can well imagine,
scenes of pleasant festivities where the sweet melody of the ‘rabab’
filled the air like the perfumes that burnt in silver censers and where

the forbidden liquid, the red. juice of the grape, flowed and overflowed
on all sides. The aged and stern monarch, Balban, was now a puritan
and had renounced wine,’ and so naturally did not approve of such
almost bacchanalian parties. Discipline was his great passion and he
kept a strict control over the actions of his own sons and grandsons,?
and took great care to keep them away from such festive gatherings.
It was, probably, secretly and in constant dread of the royal wrath,
that some of them managed to spend a pleasant night in one of the
merry assemblies held in the houses of some of the nobles, and one
such stolen visit proved ultimately to be the cause of an estrangement
between Khusrau and his patron. The poet relates the story himself
thus: ‘One day the younger son of the king Bughra Khan was kind
enough t6 come as a guest to the house of the great Khan, Kishli ®
Khan, who was his cousin. The visit was a secret one, for reports of
their festive gatherings were always conveyed to the king. The prince
had with him some of his confidential attendants, among whom were
Shamsuddin Dabir ¢ and Qadi Athir. The presence of these two scholars
was like the conjunction of the two auspicious planets ® or the combina-
tion of the sun and the moon, and I, who am Mercury,® felt flattered to
be in that company. On their side, these two tried to establish their
sway in the-domain of poetry, and in response I sounded so loudly the
sweet drum of poesy that I did not yield them the palm. The rumblings
that arose from the two sides opened wide the ears of the two great
princes ” as well as their attendants, and as the poets recited their verses,
the cloud of their generosity rained so heavily that it moistened all
that is on the surface of the earth. Wonderful gold-scattering! The
eyes of the beholders became yellow § at the sight of the dinars * and the

® Khusrau here used the word dinar, evidently, in ita general sense of any
gold coin, as distinct from dirhem, a coin of baser metal. The usual currency of
his day consisted of ‘ tankah ’ of either gold or silver and jitals, a very small copper
coin,

skirts of their robes were torn, with the weight of the gold they held,
like the rose, in a hundred shreds. My sweet verses suited so well the
taste of Bughré Khan that, out of that generosity which is the charac-
teristic of kings and princes, he ordered a dish full of silver tankahs?
to be brought to me as a present from himself, and with this generous
gift he made me a grateful slave of his.

‘Our Khan was, however, of a very jealous temperament, and his
face at once showed signs of displeasure. I saw that and tried to re-
concile him, but he would not listen to any of my explanations. Several
days passed after this incident and still the memory of the past events
was not wiped away from his mind. He wanted to punish me and to
make me the target of the dart of his anger. As I thought of that dart,
my heart ached (and I thought it better to seek protection fn flight).
So I bolted away like an arrow.’ ?

The unfortunate incident ended the relationship between the Khan
and the poet, and the latter was now faced with the problem of finding
another suitable patron. Bughra Khan, whose other name was
Nasiruddin, was now the governor of Simana, an important fortress,
that, like Multan, guarded the route leading from the frontiers to the
capital, Delhi,’ while his elder brother Muhammad, the favourite son
of their father, held the governorship of Multan since after the death of.
Sher Khan, the able general who had done so much to aid Balban in
keeping at bay the marauding Mongols. He had already appreciated
Khusrau’s talent‘ and so naturally the poet thought of him in this
hour of distress. He betook himself to Samana, and the prince, from
what he had heard and seen of the poet, was only too glad to receive
him under his protection. Khusrau became his cherished boon-com-
panion.® ‘T began to serve him’, he says, ‘and every day I rose higher
in his favour and eSteem.’®

But soon afterwards the poet was dislodged from this refuge and
haven of rest and had to make, probably, the first long journey of his
life.

Tughril, a Turkish slave, held the provinces of Lakhnauti and
Bengal under Balban. He was a strong, energetic and brave man,
and succeeded in bringing the provinces under his complete control.

the poet simply means ‘ white as jughraét’ (curds) as he is writing with analogies

He reduced Hajinagar* and won large plunder in the shape of gold, jewels,
elephants, and horses. But his successes turned his head and the natives
of those parts, always ready to rebel, so that the province of Lakhnauti
had acquired the nickname of Bulghakpur (The City of Revolt), succeeded
in inducing him to throw over the yoke of Delhi and to declare his
independence. Tughril, in the 14th year of Balban’s reign, or about
676 H., proclaimed himself king of Lakhnauti and Bengal, assumed the
title of Mughithuddin, and the privileges of ‘ Khutba’? and ‘ Sikka ’3
and refused to acknowledge the suzerainty of Delhi, keeping to himself
all the rich spoils he had obtained in Hajinagar. The king, Balban,
he thought was too old and too preoccupied with the Mongol scare to:
turn his attention seriously to Lakhnauti. But he was soon to be dis-
illusioned.

Balban, on hearing of this rebellion, the only one of his otherwise
peaceful reign, sent an army to Lakhnauti under Amin Khin, but this
army was routed and put to flight by the superior forces of Tughril,
whose lavish gifts had procured him supporters even in the royal army.
The defeated general returned to Delhi and was mercilessly punished by
being hanged on the Badaon Gate, as the stern king wanted to make
this a warning for his generals. He then sent another army, but Tughril,
encouraged by his first success, fell upon it and defeated it with great
slaughter. This second disaster exhausted the king’s patience. He
was mad with rage, and bit his shoulders in his fury. The rainy season
was fast approaching, but, disregarding all obstacles, he at once prepared
to march on Lakhnauti himself. He made extensive preparations for
the provision of boats and other requisites, placed Delhi under the:
charge of the Kotwal, the Amir-ul-Umara, and distributing the territory
of Samana and Sonim among various nobles, and appointing Malik
Siinaj Sarjandar * the naib of Sdmana, asked his son Bughra Khan to
accompany him with his followers and retainers to Lakhnauti.

1 Sic in Barni. Firishta and Khusrau, however, give the name as Jajnagar,,
which is the correct form.

2 For a full account of Khutba, its significance and history, see Ency. of Islam,
V. II, p. 980 seq.

3 Coinage. The right of minting and issuing coinage has always been a royal
prerogative.

4 Sarjandaér. Jandar means generally an armour-bearer or a guard, a custodian,
in which latter sense it was employed in those days in India. Firishta explains
‘ jindars’ as ‘ Khasa Khail’, which Raverty interprets as ‘slaves’ and remarks :
‘But such cannot be correct for Sultan Mu‘izuddin himself was “ Sar-i-jandar ”
to his brother Ghiyathuddin. The jandars were generally slaves, as most trust-
worthy, no doubt’. Why ‘ Khaga Khail’ should be taken to mean ‘slaves’ is
not very clear. ‘Khasa’ (more correctly Khagsa) means more often ‘private’,
confidential, and hence exclusive and royal. It is thus that Khaga in India often.

Thus it was that Khusrau had also to share the hardships of the
arduous royal march to Lakhnauti. He had to do so much against
his will, we presume, for there is a distinct strain of bitterness in his
account of the journey. But the prince naturally did not want tc
part with such a lively and pleasant companion. ‘All at once’, says
Khusrau, ‘the sublime banners moved from the capital city of Delhi
in hot haste towards Lakhnauti, and cutting through the river (Sara)
with the glittering swords proceeded towards the Eastern Ocean. The
prince was already preparing to start when the king’s emissary arrived,
and at once, in obedience to the royal orders, with a numerous army
he joined the camp of the ruler of the world.’ ?

No sooner had the king crossed the river than the rains set in in
real earnest,” and the royal army had to make long forced halts on its
way through the flooded country. ‘For one year we tramped on
and yet the journey was not over’, says the poet. Tughril, on hearing
of the approach of the king, gathered together all his treasures, and
with these he fled away towards Hajinagar, taking with him also a large
number of the inhabitants of Lakhnauti whom he had induced to follow
him with promises of an early return to their homes. ‘The king will
soon get weary of this wild goose chase and would not stay in Lakhnauti
long. We can, then return peacefully ’, he assured them. But he was
‘mistaken. Balban was a man of iron determination, and was not to
be deterred by any obstacles. ‘I shall follow him even into the sea’,
he declared, and having reached and occupied Lakhnauti, he proceeded
‘towards Hajinagar. The march now became more difficult. ‘ During
‘tthe journey of 150 kurohs’, continues Khusrau, ‘on that side of
Lakhnauti ® the burdens * and the saddle-cloths could scarcely be taken
-off from the backs of the beasts, for each of those hundred and fifty
‘kurohs was a veritable infliction.® The country was full of marauding

‘meant the royal food, being, no doubt a contraction of ‘ Khasa ta’ém ’ or ‘ ta‘am-i-
dchagsa’. Hence ‘ Khasa Khail’ would be the royal cavalry or the king’s guards and
‘S4rjandar the chief officer r of those guards, corresponding to the English ‘ Master
of the House’ and to the Egyptian Amir-Jandar, the chief of the guards of the
Zardah Khana or royal prison. Elliot has changed the word into ‘ Sirjandar ’
and several other historians into ‘Sarjamdar’. (See Raverty T. N., p. 603, N. 7
and Lane’s Arabian Nights, V. II, p. 238, N. 91, Chapter X.)

Hindus,’ who, in the hope of getting spoils, and relying on the (difficult
nature) of that land, carried on their crafty raids on us.2 There were
marshes all over the track, such that if I were caught in one of them,
I should have been lost in what they call the Black Water and the
Dark Clay.’

The king having arrived at Sunargion, saw the rajah of that place
and took from him a promise to bar Tughril’s flight as far as possible.
He then moved on towards Hajinagar, but could find no trace of the
fugitive. When he was only about fifty to sixty kurohs from Hajinagar
he appointed one of his generals * to proceed in advance of the main
army and to reconnoitre the whereabouts of Tughril. A small party of
this advance-guard luckily got hold of two merchants who were returning
from Tughril’s camp after executing some transactions there. Threats
of death soon extorted from them the secret of the enemy’s camp.
Tughril’s army had halted in a grove near a tank, and putting off their
arms and unloading their beasts, were engaged in various peaceful
occupations,—cooking, bathing, sleeping, and singing. The small party,
headed by Malik Mohd. the Lion-killer,‘ the governor of Kiil, and his
brother, Malik Muqaddar, afterwards known as ‘ Tughril-slayer’,® fell
upon the unwary foes, and before the latter could overcome their
surprise, captured and slew Tughril. His followers fled away in panic,
and soon the main advance-guard joined the gallant maliks. All the
treasures, elephants, slaves, wives, sons, and daughters of Tughril fell
into the hands of the victors, and his head was sent to the royal
‘presence’. Tughril having been thus ‘clipped ’,® as Khusrau says, the
king rewarded richly the brave officers, sent a long and jubilant letter of
victory to Delhi, and demonstrated his wrath by lining the main
thoroughfare of Lakhnauti, a kuroh long, with gibbets on which were
hanged the relations and friends of the unfortunate rebel.

The king now appointed his son, Bughré Khan, governor of
Lakhnauti and Bengal, and invested him with ‘ chatr’ + and ‘ dirbash ’.2
‘With the governorship of Lakhnauti and the red umbrella, the prince
was so exalted’, says Khusrau, ‘that his lofty head reached the azure
vault of heaven itself.’ ® .

Balban now turned back towards the capital, but before that, he
called his son Bughré Khan and his secretary Shamsuddin Dabir to his
presence, and dictated a long code of moral and political principles to be
scrupulously adhered to by his son, laying special stress on the latter’s
submission and faithful obedience to the king of Delhi, whoever he
might happen to be.

Shamsuddin Dabir, a scholar and a talented poet himself, was a
great patron of poetry, and had been very kind to Khusrau from the
very beginning of the latter’s career. Khusrau acknowledged his
gratitude to him on several occasions during the course of his writings.‘
The secretary, as appreciative of the poet’s value as a companion as
was his master, Bughré Khan, wanted to detain Khusrau in Lakhnauti.
But the latter could not be persuaded to remain there. He was loth
to leave Delhi and live in a marsh-ridden province so far from his rela-
tives and friends. ‘ Malik Shamsuddin ’, he says, ‘ wanted to persuade
me to stay there, but I was concerned at the separation from my dear
ones. So like Joseph, from that prison-well I started towards the
populous Egypt (or city: «») and under the protection of the royal
standard, reached the city (of Delhi).’ The probable date of his arrival
there is about the year 680 H.

When the king reached Delhi there was great rejoicing in the capital
and all aver the neighbouring places. Tajiks® and Turks as well as
Hindus greeted the victorious sovereign with rich presents. Feasting

and merry-making went on for days together. Prince Muhammad Qian,
afterwards known as Khan-i-Shahid, was among those who came to
Delhi to offer their homage and felicitations to the aged monarch. He
came from Multan with rich presents and Tartar horses which he had
gathered together during his father’s absence from Delhi. The Sultan
was immensely pleased by his favourite son’s obedience and filial regard.

Now, Prince Mohd had inherited several of the good qualities of his
father. He was brave and courageous, a'good soldier, and an efficient
commander, jbut he had none of Balban’s sternness and dry puritanism.
He was, on the contrary, a gentle and amiable man, fond of poetry and
music, and also of the pleasures of life. He had, no doubt, often heard
of the rising poet, and had even, perhaps, heard some of his fine odes
from his own lips in the assemblies of the khans and maliks during his
visits to the capital. What.could be more natural than that he should,
at this time of universal rejoicing and happiness, invite the poet to his
presence and ask him to recite some of his verses ?

‘In those days’, says Khusrau, ‘the honoured Khan, the great
Qaain Malik, had come to Delhi after the victory of Dam (?) and as my
fortune was fated to be linked up with his, he was pleased to ask about
the ripe fruit of my speech (i.e. poetry). I took to him a few verses
that happened to be ready. The prince appreciated them very much
and. rewarded me with a robe of honour! and a cap.’ The prince asked
Khusrau to accompany him to Multan and the poet, readily agreeing,
‘ tied the cincture of service round his waist and donned the cap of com-
pansionship on his head.’ #

After Delhi, Multan was certainly the most important city of the
kingdom in those days. Its situation on the route of the Mongol invaders
gave it great strategic importance. It had been the seat of the
governors of Sind for a long time, and some of them, like Nasiruddin
Qubacha, with their generosity and hospitality had gathered within it
a large number of noblés and scholars who came fleeing to India before
the Mongol onslaught.? It was thus a literary centre of no mean rank,

and was at the same time a prosperous trade centre. Here came the
traders from across the border with the rich manufactures of Balkh and
Bukhara and the lusejous fruit of Samarqand and Qandhar, and the
Multani merchants became rich and prosperous money-lenders whose
aid was eagerly sought by the extravagantly generous maliks and
kb&ns for replenishing their dwindling funds. The city was also the
refuge of certain saintly personages whose spiritual sway over the masses
was both vast and strong, and while Sheikh Nizimuddin Auliya? lived
and preached in the days of which we are speaking in Delhi, one of his
tivals, Sheikh Sadruddin, son of Sheikh Bahaiuddin Zakariyyi, was the
spiritual head of the siifis in Multan.

Prince Mahammad’s residence in Delhi was the haunt of scholars
and saints,® and his court in Multan rivalled, perhaps, even the court
of his royal father. ‘ His court was filled with wise men and scholars
and skilful artists. His boon-companions read the Shah-Namah, the
diwans of Sandi and Khaqani, and the Khamsa of Sheikh Nizimi, and
learned critics discussed before him the (merits of the) verses of these
great men.’ Courteous and polite, the prince was one of the most
cultured men of his time. He knew well how: to appreciate merit and
how to reward it. He was scrupulous to a fault in the observance of
decorum. ‘If he had to sit for a day and a night together on the seat
of “ amarat”’* (governorship) he never once raised his knees up and was
never seen sitting crosslegged,®° on such occasions.’ Never did an
abusive word profane his lips and he was never immoderate in drinking
wine. He was respectful towards persons of sanctity and holiness and
would stand in humble attitude in their presence. One day Sheikh
Uthman and Sheikh Sadruddin attended his assembly, and the two
saints began to dance in ecstasy on hearing some Arabic verses recited
by the ‘ qawwils 76 The prince got up and stood by in a respectful

and jesters.

attitude, his eyes filled with tears, and remained like that till the saints
had finished their mystic frolics and had subsided into their usual
equanimity and gravity. He was extremely fond of poetry and had a
very good taste and a refined judgment. He had a manuscript written
by himself in an elegant hand, which contained a selection of about
twenty thousand verses from the greatest of the old masters, and testified
to his sense of the beautiful and noble in poetry.

Among the brightest gems in his court which was, in Firishta’s
words, ‘ the envy of the garden of Paradise ’, the most prominent were
our poet Khusrau and his bright friend and contemporary, Amir
Najmuddin Hasan Sanjari, whose friendship Khusrau seems to have
formed in his early youth.

Romantic stories have been woven round the two poets and their
friendship has been glorified into a mystic love. According to Firishta,
Amir Khusrau, in the prime of his youth, was passing through a street
in the august company of his preceptor, the Sheikh Nizaémuddin Auliya,
and. some of his disciples when Hasan, who was in those days a comely
youth, was sitting in the shop of a baker. Amir Khusrau’s eye lighted
on Hasan and, attracted by his beauty, he went to the shop and asked
him, ‘How do you sell bread?’ Hasan replied: ‘I place bread in one
of the scales of the balance and ask the customer to place his money
in the other, and if the money is heavier, I let him go (with the bread) ’.
Khusrau said : ‘ But what would you do if the customer happened to be
a poor man?’ ‘Qh’, replied Hasan, ‘in that case I should accept his
love and humility in place of money’. Khusrau was astonished and
pleased by his witty talk, and mentioned him to his Sheikh. Khwaja
Hasan, also conceiving a strong passion for Khusrau, left the shop,
and although he did not become a disciple of the Sheikh immediately,
he busied himself with greater vigour in the acquisition of knowledge and
virtue and began to frequent the abode of the Sheikb, so that a great
friendship sprang up between him and Amir Khusrau.!

Firishta then narrates how the two poets went to Multan, Khusrau
as the ‘ mushafdar’? and Hasan as the ‘ dawatdar ’ * of Prince Muhammad,
and how their love became widely known till some scandalmongers
cast aspersions on their character in the presence of the prince, saying

(Rim) and enlivened the assemblies of Sheikh Bahaéuddin Zakariyya, the father of
Sheikh Sadruddin of Multan.

they belonged to the malimati sect. The prince, it is said, forbade
Hasan to visit Khusrau, but that availed nothing, so that he one day
had him whipped. {he young man was, however, no sooner out of
the court than he went to his friend Khusrau. Exasperated at this
open defiance of his authority, the prince ordered both of them to. his
presence and asked them to explain their conduct. ‘We are one,
body and soul’? said Khusrau. The prince demanded evidence of the
purity of their love, whereupon Khusrau put his arm out of his sleeve
and recited : ‘ The witness of a true lover is in the sleeve’. The prince
saw that Khusrau’s arm bore traces of whipping exactly at the same
spots where his friend Hasan was struck, and was silenced. Then Amir
Khusrau recited the following quatrain :

‘Love came and spread like blood in my veins. It emptied me
of all else and filled me with my friend. All the atoms of
my existence belong to the loved one : my name alone remains
by me, all else is his.’ 4

Khusrau then wanted to resign his office, but the prince refused to let
him do so.

The story may or may not be true. There is nothing intrinsically
impossible or absurd about it. Such mystic and platonic love was a
common occurrence among the Sifis, who in fact recognized it as an

- important stage in the progress of the novice towards real or divine
love, the ‘ ishq-i-haqiqi, as they called it.

But what makes one suspect its authenticity is the fact that Barni,
the contemporary historian, makes no mention of a ‘love’ between the
two poets. He speaks of their friendship, which, according to his own
version, was in a way brought about by himself.© One may even admit
that the friendship was a very close one, for Khusrau, in his Afdal-ul-

prehensible deeds, seeking thereby to curb their vanity and egoism. A great support-

Fawaid, mentions him as ‘my brother’,) although it is not quite safe
to draw this conclusion from the polite form of appellation so commonly
employed among friends not necessarily very intimate. But that the
friendship had in it something of the intense passion characteristic of
’ love which can really exist only between members of the opposite sexes,
is hard to believe. There is no internal evidence whatsoever to this
effect, either in the writings of Khusrau or in those of Hasan. In fact,
one is singularly struck by the absence of any reference or allusion to
each other by the two poets in their poems, and were it not for an
occasional mention of Hasan’s name by Khusrau in his prose works,
notably Afdal-ul-Fawaid, and the evidence supplied by Barni, one
would have been loth to believe even the existence of an ordinary friend-
ship, synonymous with mutual respect, between the two contemporaries.
Several biographers quote a quatrain of Hasan to prove his esteem
and affection for Khusrau, but most of them give only the first two
lines and omit the other two, thus drawing a favourable conclusion for
‘themselves. But the whole quatrain is not at all capable of an inter-
pretation that is generally given to it. The original runs thus :—
ce Cnr od Ge tal onde @S oly 3) gpa

CX oe Sel Fe a wm wT
which is, I think, rather a sarcastic allusion to Khusrau. The name
Khusrau in the first line is used in the sense of a prince or a king, and

I would translate it thus :

‘The king kindly accepts what this poor slave/Hasan says. My
poetry is not like that of Khusrau: poetry is this that I

- compose.” Tie le
The last line is certainly not very complimentary to Khusrau. There
was, one is tempted to suspect, a certain amount of rivalry between the
two poets, in spite of their friendship and comradeship as fellow-officers
in the court of Prince Muhammad in their youth, and as disciples of
Nizimuddin Auliya in their riper years, and the suspicion is strengthened
by these lings as well as by Khusrau’s caustic remarks, scattered all
through his works, against contemporary poets who, according to him,
pilfered and pinched his verses and tried with ungrateful audacity to
vie with him in the realm of poesy. Khusrau, of course, mentions no
names : he was too sensible and polite to do that. But the fact that he
makes no exceptions and does not anywhere speak of Hasan in terms

1 See for instance, p. 9 (Afdal-u]-Fawaid).
2 Diwan of Hasan (B.M. MS. fragments).

of admiration and applause,! would tend to show that he included him
in the general condemnation. This sort of professional jealousy can
easily be understood when we consider the peculiar conditions of their
age. The poets had to guard with jealous care not only their fame and
glory but also the rich stipends and presents from their patrons, that
could be snatched away from them by their successful rivals. Thus,
on the whole, while one could readily concede thdt the two poets were
good friends as far as social intercourse is concerned, it is not at all
established, that the friendship had developed into ‘ love ’ and that they
were ‘one, body and soul ’.

The author of the Baharistén-i-Sukhan has also tried to disprove
this story, but the argument he advances against its probability is not
very satisfactory, and is based on an erroneous conjecture of Sheikh
‘Abdul Haq of Delhi, who says in his Akhbar-ul-Akbyar : ‘It appears
that Hasan was a little senior to Khusrau, for while the former has
composed several splendid odes in praise of Ghiyaéthuddin Balban, there
are few such panegyrics in the poetical works of the latter’. Hasan
was not senior to Khusrau, but was, in fact, born in the same year as his
contemporary, and that the latter has also several fine odes in praise of
Balban, we shall see later on.

To resume our story, however, Khusrau and Hasan remained in
Multan with the unfortunate prince till his death under tragic circum-
stances in the year 683 H. ‘For five years’, says Khusrau, ‘I watered
the five rivers of Multan with the seas of my delectable verses ’.® Life
there must have been comparatively dull for the lively poet. The
court of the prince, no doubt, was resplendent in glory, his assemblies
were attended by brilliant scholars, and his wine-parties were enlivened
by famous musicians. But the city itself, lying amidst a desert country

1 At one place only, in his dibacha of Ghurrat-ul-Kamél, Khusrau mentions
Hasan's name as a poet of distinction. While trying to prove the superiority of
Persian poetry over Arabic poetry, he says : ‘If anybody praises the hollow verse
of Mu‘izzI for the elegance of its style and the beauty of its ideas, he ought to
study the words and ideas of Syed Hasan (sic), Nizim! and Zahir’. ®

far from the capital, with the Mongols always hammering at its gates,

‘was, one would think, not a very pleasant place to live in for one who
had been used to the ease and comforts of a life in Delhi. The poet
had, moreover, to, accompany the prince in his campaign against the
Mongols to several other more unpleasant and dreary places—to the
outlying fortresses on the frontier, garrisoned by the rough Afghans.)
During his sojourn in one of these fortresses, he wrote a long letter to
Ikhtiyaruddin,? in which he bewails his separation from Delhi and the
hardships he had to endure.? _

‘My abode was’, says he, ‘the Arch of Islam, the “‘qibla” of the
kings of the seven realms—Delhi, that twin-sister of the blessed Heaven,
a tract of paradise on the surface of the earth. The nine skies cast
their hallowing shadow over it and the seven realms are but like the
chain‘ at its gate. Its lofty palaces raise their heads to the skies and
overshadow the sun itself, while its streets are so thronged with men
that the eye roving on them is filled with images that leave no place
even for the pupil of the eye.®..... Its green fields are bedecked with
roses, and its springs are brighter than bright eyes—running waters
pleasant as life, like milk flowing through sugar. The tank of the Sultan,
with its colours and illuminations® looks like molten silver cast into
stone. Its gardens are full of pleasure-seekers, rose-cheeked beauties
with pierced ears, bright as the pearls of their ear-rings. The melodies
of the “ ‘id ” and the “‘rabab” that rise in the gardens intoxicate the
trees and render the fountains drowsy. My days passed there in seeing
new. sights on all sides, and the nights in enjoying the company of a
fair one. Perchance I was a burden to that fair garden,’ so that fate
has imprisoned me in this land of thorns—a fortress hot as the blazing
furnace..... full of beasts and brutes, like a wilderness..... In this
fortress live the Afghans—nay, man-slaying® demons, for even the
demons groan in fright at their shouts. Their heads like big sacks of

straw, their beards like the combs of the weaver, long-legged as the
stork but more ferocious than the eagle, their heads lowered like that
of the owl of the wilderness.* Their voices hoarse and shrill like that
of a jack-daw, their mouths open like that of a shark. Their tongue
is blunt like a home-made arrow, and flings stones like the sling of a
battering-ram.‘ Well has a wise man said that when speech was sent
to men from the sky, the Afghans got the last and least share of it.°’

Yet he could come to his beloved city and meet his relatives at
least once a year, for Prince Muhammad paid annual visits to the royal
court, where he laid before the feet of his father such treasures as he
had managed to collect during the space of the preceding year, and
whence he went back to his provincial seat loaded with new favours and
fresh blessings from his father.

Khusrau must by this time have been married. The verse translated
above would tend to show this. Curiously enough, all his biographers
are silent on this point, and we have no idea when or to whom he was
married. But that he was married and had several children is evident
from his own writings, as we shall see hereafter. These visits to Delhi,
then, must have been fraught with special interest and attraction for ©
the poet. Probably he never took his wife and children with him to
Multan. That was not the fashion of the day, and, then, it was not
quite safe in those unsettled times to take one’s women-folk about
through regions that were constantly a scene of warfare and turmoil.
He must have been contented during these five years to see his dear
ones for just a few weeks in a year, and we can well imagine the sorrows
of long days of waiting and the pangs of the tender and sad partings.
It was, probably, at one of these sad farewells that he was moved to
say:

‘A great sorrow it is to be separated from the loved one. Ah, to
whom shall I narrate the story of my doleful separation ? ’§

On the whole, however, this was perhaps the happiest period of
the poet’s life. He had established his claim to be the foremost poet
of the age. He was still comparatively young, full of vigour and ambition,
and each day mellower and richer strains came out of his lyre. His
fame spread far and wide, and his fine odes in praise of the gallant prince
were the envy of his rivals. He had now made the second collge-
tion of his poems, and the new ‘ diwan’ which he called ‘ Wast-ul-Hayat "}
passed from hand to hand. He was known even in Persia, the land of
roses and poetry, where Sa‘di, now an old man, wags unquestionably the
greatest master. It is said that Prince Muhammad, always anxious to
collect about him the greatest and the most celebrated scholars and
poets of his age, wanted Sa‘di also to come and settle at Multan. Twice
he sent some of his trusted companions with rich presents to the old
poet in Shiraz, inviting him to Multan, where he promised to build
for him a ‘ khanq&h’ and to endow it with the revenue of several towns
and villages. But each time Sa‘di refused, on the ground of old age
and feeble health, to leave his beloved Shiraz. However, he sent the
prince a copy of a selection of his verses in his own handwriting, with
profuse excuses, and a special recommendation of Amir Khusrau, for
whom he expressed a profound admiration.”

It is, perhaps, this incident that has helped the formation of a
popular belief, namely that Sheikh Sa‘di in his old age came to Delhi
expressly to see Amir Khusrau.2 That Sa‘di came to India at any
period of his life has been the subject of a great controversy. He claims
in his own works that he did so, and saw ‘ the ivory idol’ of Somnath,
as ‘richly adorned as the Manat’ in Pre-Islamic Arabia,* and the

‘unclean mughs’ worshipping round it. Several scholars, however,
“are inclined to discredit the visit and to consider Sa‘di’s account of it
‘ag ‘an imaginary narrative analogous to those which one finds in the
‘ Assemblies of Hariri”’. But as Henri Massé points out, in the
absence of any proofs to the contrary, it is unfair to reject as fables all
that Sheikb Sa‘di says of bis visit to India, although it is possible that
his account of the things he claims to have seen is highly coloured. A
trip to India, either through the overland trade-route from Khwarizm
and Khorasan to Sind, or by boat from Shiraz to the north-western
coast of India, was nothing impracticable or impossible for a man who
had spent a large portion of his life in wandering through ‘ the extremes
of the world ’,* mixing with diverse peoples and getting into all sorts of
scrapes. According to Ibn-i-Khurdadbih, Jewish merchants came to
India as early as 864 a.D. (250 H.), and, as De Massé asks pertinently,
why should we be sceptical about Sa‘di’s visit to India in the seventh
century of the Hejira when we take for granted (as Barbier de Meynard
does) that Mas‘iidi came to that country in the fourth century ?®

But, although we may concede reasonably that the old master of
Shiraz came to India, probably visiting Gujarat and Sind, we have
absolutely no evidence to establish his visit to Delhi. On the contrary,
the story is evidently a myth. An event of such importance, the visit
of a famous poet of Persia, whose books were the talk of the whole of
Asia and who was venerated and imitated by poets far and wide, to the
brilliant capital of India, could not have been ignored by contemporary
historians and other writers, and Khusrau, at least, must have made
some allusion to it in his copious prose and poetic works. Thus, although
some very old authorities like Jami and Daulat Shah assert that Khusrau
met ‘Sheikh Sa‘di, it is extremely doubtful that he ever did so, or that

4 According to J. Ross (The Gulistan, p. 19), Sa‘di visited Delhi between the
years 607 and 633 of the Hegira. But, as Defrémery says: ‘cette opinion de

the latter ever visited Pelhi.1 The two poets, however, knew each
other, and while Khusrau, like so many other poets of that age, tried
to show his veneration for the old master by imitating his style in lyrical
poetry, the latter also condescended, as we have seen, to bestow bis
blessings and approval on the young disciple.

During the five years of Khusrau’s stay in Multan, there were,
apparently, several encounters with the Mongols. They came almost
every year swooping down on the plains of the Punjab like hungry wolves,
and only the most efficient organization and the keenest watchfulness
could keep them off. Prince Muhammad was always on the look out
for them and, not content with repulsing their onslaughts, he probably
led expeditions against them, and each victory provided a fresh theme
for the poet to try his skill on. He is loud in praise of the pringe’s
heroic exploits. ‘ Although each year’, he sings, ‘the Mongols come
from Khorasan in serried ranks like storks, with owlish wings and
ominous faces, at the time of their rout under the world-conquering
sword of the Prince they are rent into morsels and then despatched to
Kirman (or worms). Fondly do the enemies yield up their ghosts
wherever the Turks send the showers of their fatal arrows. Each time
when an army of the enemies surging like the sea arrives, a new
splendour is imparted to the dust of Multan.’ *

But a catastrophe was approaching, and a cruel fate awaited the
brilliant prince. In 683, in the last month of the year (i.e. Dhulbhijja),
the prince received news of the arrival of a Mongol force, twenty thousand
strong, near Lahore and Dibalpur. The invaders were led by Timur ®
Khan who held the provinces of Hirat, Balkh, Badakshan, Ghaznin,
Ghur, and Bamayan under Arghin KhAn, the grandson of Hulagu Khan.
Timur came burning with thoughts of revenge for his relatives and
kinsfolk killed in previous encounters, and hopes of rich plunder from

1 According to Jami (Nafahat-ui-Uns : Nassau Lees, 1859, pp. 110-11) Khusrau
in his youth met Sheikh Sa‘di and he prided himself on the encounter; but he
does not, as J. Ross says, identify him with the comely youth whom Sa‘dimet at
Kashghar. (See N. 3, p. 82, also Defrémery : Gulistan, p. XXIV, N. 3.) Daulat
Sh&h relates the incident on the authority of Azuri’s Jawahir-ul-Asrér: (Daulat
Shah : Tezkira, p. 239).

2 Wast-ul-Hayat (1.0. MS., 1187), fol. 89. Kirman is both the name of a town
in Persia and the plural of ‘kirm’, a worm, and both meanings are apt here. Jt
is interesting to note that the name Kirman is in fact said to have been derived
from ‘kirm' (a worm). See for instance, ‘The Glory of the Shia World’ by
Sykes and Ahmed Din (1910), pp. 83-85, the Shahnémah, etc. .

the Land of the five Rivers. The prince at once prepared to meet him,
and started in hot haste from Multan early in the morning, reaching the
river Ravi (.#Y oT) at about midday. Timur crossed over and
attacked the prince’s army. A bloody and desperate struggle ensued.
Several big Mongol chiefs were slain and their army was forced to
retreat. The Indian generals, throwing caution to the winds in the
excitement of victory, started in their pursuit. The prince was left
alone with only five hundred followers, and coming to the river-bank
he started to offer his midday prayers. A Mongol chieftain who had
been lying in ambush with two thousand horse, saw his opportunity and
fell upon the prince’s army. Prince Muhammad fought heroically,
- waging a desperate struggle, but an arrow from the famous Mongol
bows struck him and he fell dead almost when his brave resistance had
tired the Mongols and they were hastening away to join their retreating
comrades. The Mongols now cut down mercilessly the panic-stricken
followers of the dead prince, and plundering all they could get, and
taking most of them prisoners, started back to overtake the main
force.+

In his elegy on the sad death of Prince Muhammad, Khusrau des-
cribes the campaign and its tragic end very vividly, and I give here a
translation of portions of it :?

‘Is this an affliction or a calamity that the sky has disclosed, and
is this a disaster or the Resurrection itself that the world beholds to-day 2’

What, an inauspicious hour was that when the prince started with
his army from Multan and drew his infidel-slaying sword to slaughter
the unbelievers! When he received news of the enemy’s approach,
he at once donned the helmet and hoisted his flag. He started with
whatever army he had in readiness and did not tarry for reinforcements,
for a Rustam does not seek the aid of an army.’ One swift move

1 For the account of this battle see Firishta Text, V. I, p. 82, Barni, pp. 109-
110; Badaoni (Bib. Ind., 1868), V. I, p. 130 seq. Badaoni also gives an elegy in
elegant prose by Hasan, the contemporary of Khusrau.

2 The elegy is a very fine specimen of Khusrau’s poetry and is full of deep
pathos. Note also its accuracy of detail, almost without any exaggerations or
boasting. The poet describes the campaign just as it was,—an indecisive duel,
wherein no party could claim victory, but which probably would have ended in a
retreat of the Mongols (as it ultimately did) and so a success for the Indian troops,
had not the whole thing been transformed into a tragedy by the prince’s death.
The reading adopted is from the India Off. MS., No. 1187 (Wast-ul-Hayat, fol.
1820 seq.). See also Badaoni, Vol. I, p. 138, where the elegy is given in extenso,
only the reading is not quite correct.

brought him to Lahore from Multan, for he was indignant that the
enemy should have the audacity to raise their head in his domain.
‘Am I net that lion’, he said, ‘ whose sword, possessing the virtues of
fire and water, lays low on dust and ashes thousands of my foes each
year ? So much of their blood have I caused to flow like water that
the vultures swim in it as the duck does in the river. This year the,
ground shall be dyed so red with their blood that the twilight will borrow
its red tinge from the earth.’

‘He started with this idea, but, alas! the heavenly fates drew
across his plans the line of Divine Will. On the eve? of Muharram
he went out with his armies to thrust his spear down into the throats
of the foes, and entered the field, like Husain of Karbala, before the
‘Ashira*® had come, the dust from his horse’s hoof supplying collyrium
for the Sun’s eye. Unhappy hour when the enemy attacked him,
crossing the river horde on horde till they drew close to his army! Then
you could see the prince’s charger clouding the sky with dust and
scattering the infidels like chaff in its stormy onslaught. You could see
the sky resound with the shouts of the warriors and the earth tremble
with the swift rush* of his horsemen. The rumbling of drums, the
neighing of horses, and the war-cries of the knights made plains, deserts,
and mountains quake. The heroes attacked to wipe out the enemy,
while the cowards sought pretexts to escape ; but the brave, generous
prince on that battlefield thought only of fighting like a man and urging
his men to fight.

‘The day grew dusky while they were engaged in this grim contest,
and the sun grew pale as the bright spears met and clashed. Evening
was falling when with the blue steel of the swords a sky was woven
over the “sun” of the army, and the lines of swords in the two sides
were like advancing shadows as the opponents closed in in the hand-to-
hand duel.t The earth looked blue as armour touched armour and the

plain became like a rose-garden when shield joined shield.1_ The dead
lay on that field like figures woven into green tapestry, and still the
armies fought till midday grew into evening, face to face, hegd to head
and hair to hair, and during this time the’ prince’s sword did not rest
for a single moment from its slaughter of the foes. My God! was it
blood that covered the ground or was it a sea-wave that advanced to
drown the enemies? The wounded were dying and struggling in their
agony, while from their throats streams of blood gushed upwards. One
went to Hell and the other to Paradise, although the blood of the infidel
and the believer flowed together in one stream.

‘The Khan rode his glorious charger, reaching from place to place
to arrange his men and to give instructions. The Sky seemed to be
swinging Victory by the hair, now this way, now that way, although
she wanted to run to us away from the accursed enemy.? The infidels
awaited the arrival of night to slink away, but all at once the scales
were turned.

‘ Horrible night when the sun fell from the sky !_ The demons went
round burning the world and the meteor ® lay helpless! The day of
that Sun of the kingdom had reached its close and so although the day
was not yet quite spent the sun had set! If Husain trod a waterless
way in Karbala, he (the Prince) was Muhammad who fell in fire by the
water. The hearts of. men were pierced like a fish-net, for by the guile
of the demon the seal of power had fallen into the river from the hand
of Jem. The infidel wallowed in blood like an ass in filthy mire and
the believer lay on the earth like a bright pearl in a pool of dirty water.

army went the way of the mirage.’ All alike fell to earth, for the dire

A very picturesque way of describing the severity of the indecisive battle.
The second line would tend to support the assertion that the victory had almost
been won by the Indian army, when the prince fell dead. Prof. Habib (p. 16)

ys : ‘ The field was irretrievably lost by the Indians ’, which is not true.

These lines would show that the prince fell dead by the river’s bank.

calamity was a miniature Day of Judgment. The severed heads of
the dead, strewn over the field, looked like Indian nuts} chased with
bright vermilion. Many a live man was there who, scared to death,
lay among the dead, his body smeared with gore and his eyes closed in
sleep. Nay, surely it was not a mere débacle—verily I have seen the
Last Day itself, for if such be the Last Day, I have seen it clearly.

cause! He departed from this world on Friday, the last day of Dbulhijja,
the close of the year 683 and the commencement of 684.’ *

It was indeed a terrible blow to India; this disaster at Multan, and
the death of the prince who was universally loved, came as a great
shock to the aged monarch. Firishta relates a story in this connection
calculated to show that the terrible fate that befell the prince was the
outcome of an estrangement between him and the saint Sadruddin of
Multan and that it was the spiritual power of that saint that sent him
to this untimely death. It is said that the prince had once foolishly
divorced his wife, an accomplished and virtuous princess, a daughter of
Sultan Ruknuddin Ibrahim, the son of Iltitmish, but repenting soon
after, he wanted to retract the hasty words that had severed the matri-
monial bond. This, however, according to the Islamic law could not
be done, unless the wife had first been married to some other person
after her divorce and then re-divorced by the second husband. The
princess, therefore, much against the wish of the prince, was married
to Sheikh Sadruddin, on the understanding that the latter would divorce

Alluding apparently to the foolish soldiers who deserted the prince in their
pursuit of the Mongols, or the line may simply mean that ‘an army disappeared
like the mirage’, referring to the large number of the slain.

three times, which makes the separation absolute.

discouragement of hasty divorces by infuriated husbands.

her, thus enabling her to return to the prince. But the princess refused
- to go back to a husband who was, as she is alleged to have said, ‘a
cruel reprobate ’,! and entreated the Sheikh to let her remain with him.
So the Sheikb refused to divorce her, and the prince, flying into a rage,
thought of murdering the Qadi® who had advised him to adopt the
subterfuge. But then he said: ‘It is useless to kill one like you, but
by to-morrow if I don’t dye the carpet of the Sheikb with his blood,
I shall consider myself to be more powerless than the woman whom
he holds back in his house’. He neither ate nor drank, and ordered
his troops to gather and assault the dwelling of the saint. Consternation
reigned throughout the city, but before the prince could execute the
plan, he heard of the Mongol invasion and started in haste, proclaiming
-his intention of dire revenge against the Sheikh on his return from the
campaign. But he never returned. ‘The treasures of Kroesus that
still travel deep in the bosom of the earth—know you that they reached
there by the jealous displeasure of the derwishes ?’? says Firishta.*

To me the whole story seems to be as unreal as it is discreditable.
No other historian mentions anything of the kind, and it is strange how
Firishta, who praises the gentleness and sobriety of Prince Muhammad
so greatly,® should here speak of him as a drunkard and a tyrant. Surely
this is a slur on the fair name of one of the noblest princes of India and
seems to be a concoction of the wild imaginations of zealots affected by
over-piety, who think the world is governed by saints and that their
slightest displeasure can upset the whole order of things. If the event
actually took place, no one would justify the conduct of the Sheikh,
and it would seem monstrous that the prince should be so cruelly punished
for his just resentment.

Be that as it may, however, the death of the prince was deeply
mourned throughout the country. Many of his followers were killed
with him, and many more taken prisoner. Among the latter was our
poet, Amir Khusrau. He describes his own captivity in a few lines
as bitter as they are poignant.°

I depict the heroic attacks of the Ghazi? like the attacks of Haidar-i-
Karrar® on the Khaibaris? But how can one avert the divine decrees
that issue from God Himself ?..... The blood of the martyrs drenched
the soil like water, while cords tied the faces of the prisoners like flowers
in a wreath. Their heads jostled in the knots of the saddle-straps and
their throats choked in the nooses of the reins. Although I escaped
alive from this painful calamity, I was taken prisoner and the fear of
death left no blood in my thin and feeble body. I had to run head-
long like a torrent, while with long tramping a thousand blisters arose
on my feet like bubbles, and the skin of my feet was rent. Life appeared
hard like the hilt of a sword on account of these hardships and the body
had become dry as the wood in the handle of an axe‘ (?) with weakness

dropped from my eyes as pearls fall from the necks of brides. The

a leopard on a hill; a foul stench came from his mouth and
filthy moustaches hung on his chin.’ If, on account of exhaustion I
slowed down my pace, he threatened me by drawing out now his
“‘tighina’”’ and now his “tughmar’’. I heaved sighs of despair and
thought in my mind that I would never be able to escape alive from

but as God wanted to let me live longer, I escaped and fled from that path of
destruction ’.

this affliction. But a thousand thanks to God who delivered me from
it, the heart unpierced by arrow and the body unscathed by sword !’?

How, exactly, the poet managed to escape, we do not know, but
probably he regained his freedom very soon after his capture,? and
perhaps by a lugky incident which he narrates elsewhere as follows :

‘ At the time when my wicked self (far be that hour from to-day !)
fell into the hands of the Mongols, I had to tramp through a desert
heaped with layers of sand, while my brain boiled like a cauldron with
the intense heat. I and my captor on horse, alike thirsty, came on
our way to a stream. Although I was terribly hot and thirsty, I did
not pour oil on my naphtha by drinking too much water. I just moistened
my lips, refreshing thereby my body so that my tormented soul found a
little respite. But the thirsty rider and his still more thirsty steed both
fell to drinking the pleasant water till they were satisfied, and so both
died soon after.’ ®

The poet, then, returned to Multan. The whole city was in mourning.
People mourned bitterly their dead prince and wept for their sons and
relatives who had fallen round him. ‘Even the sun and the moon
wept for his handsome face, and the night and the day mourned his
brief life. As the birds and the fish had also been in peace during his
reign, the air and the water were full of moanings on his death. The
inhabitants of Multan on all sides, in every alley and in each quarter,
wept, rending their clothes and tearing their hair. With the loud cries
of mourning and the beating of the drums,‘ nobody could sleep that

» (1.0. MS., 1187; fol. 78 seq.) These lines occur in a fine and lengthy ode
which the poet calls ‘ Hukmul-Hikam ’.
LF UTE 5 AS Bh Ab ET IS SF eed

Prof. Habib (pp. 16-17) gives a translation of these verses, taking for text the
reading in Badaoni which is not very satisfactory. For instance, the verse quoted
above (N. 6) is rendered—‘ and on his chin, there grew like a hyacinth, a tuft of
public hair’, because Badaoni (p. 153) has A for ae which is absurd. The
Mongols had hardly any beard and whatever they had could not very well be
compared to hyacinth (Sunbul).

% Shibli (Shi‘rul-‘Ajam, V. II, p. 114) says the poet was taken to Balkb by his
captors. This is highly improbable and is not supported by any authority. He is
evidently misled by the term ey! 45 which Khusrau uses for Delhi, and not
for the city of Balkb. Ahmed Said Méhrahrwi also makes the same mistake. (See
Hayat-i-Khusrau, p. 21 seq.)

8 Firishta (Text, Vol. I, p. 82) also thinks that ‘ he (Khusrau) got his freedom
in the manner related in ‘ Khidr Khan and Dewalrani’. (See Khidr Khan Dewalrani,
8.0.8. MS., p. 43-44 for the original of the lines translated above.) This shows
clearly that the poet was not taken to Balkh, but escaped soon after his captivity,
probably the same day. See also Prof. Habib’s ‘ Life and Works’, p. 17, n. 20.

night, for in every house there was some dead to be wept for.... The
darkness of the Hindu and the whiteness of the Turk have both dis-
appeared, for the two are alike dressed in deep blue... . the fair ones
no longer require ifdigo and rouge, for with slapping their cheeks are
red and their eyebrows blue.’ The stragglers, pouring into the city
after the rout, added to the grief of the stricken relatives. Anxiously
they watched the thin stream of survivors to recognize a beloved face
and familiar features, and wept in disappointment. ‘If a captive
returned from that bondage of affliction, they looked at his face and
cried bitterly.’ The poet himself, although he had reason to congra-
tulate himself on his escape, was stunned and bewildered. A few hours
had sufficed to lay in dust the splendid army of the prince, to upset the
glories of a hundred victories and to scatter like: chaff the brilliant
cortége that had gathered round him in his magnificent court at Multan,
Many were the dear friends whom the poet was left to mourn. ‘ What
avails’, says he in his grief, ‘my escape from the captor’s cord, when
the chain of friends and sympathizers is broken into pieces? The dust
of the garden is now strewn with gay colours and the tulips impart to
the desert the quality of achunar.’ But alas! since the storm of disaster
has scattered to dust those faces that looked like roses, the spring is
turned into autumn! The world is full of roses, but the assembly is
void of rosy faces ; pray, how may my heart be not converted into blood,
like that of the rose-bud ? None of the last year’s friends are left this
year ; oh that this year were the last year! Hand me the cup so that
in my grief I may quaff it and fill it again with my tears. And thou
too, O cloud of spring-tide, leave aside water and weep only blood like
me! Now that the years have run to six hundred and eighty-four, I
have reached the age of thirty-four—but to what purpose? For even
if my years be thirty thousand instead of thirty and four, they are one
when the end is annihilation, and even if I be a magician* and not a

mere poet, I know that dust awaits me: I may be Kaikbusrau and
not simply Khusrau, but my destination is surely the cave.’' He
says elsewhere, ‘ Alas! all at once the heart is melted into blood for my
friends—for that pleasant throng of friends, now dead and gone. The
eyes are now used, to blood-streaked tears, since the dear friends made
their last struggle in blood and. water.... If it be possible to raise
from their dusty sleep the dead ones, I would willingly sacrifice what
life remains to me to have them alive. It is a shame that my eyes
can still see while the dear ones can no longer be seen: how can I see
others instead of my friends? The friends are gone, whom shall I
embrace now? The robes of those dead ones cannot fit everyone !
Even if they strike off my head, the love of my friends I can never part
with.’ ? .

The death of the prince, moreover, gave a rude shock to the poet’s
ambitions, who hoped to rise to great and glorious heights under the
patronage of a king so noble and so generous as Prince Muhammad
would have made, had his life been spared. Long did Khusrau cherish
the memory of his beloved patron, and years after the catastrophe he
would say to his friends with a sigh: ‘If fortune had been kind to us,
Sultin Muhammad would have been our king and patron now’.®

Khusrau now came back to Delhi, where the news of the disaster
had caused bitter anguish. For months the people mourned and recited
the elegies of Khusrau and Hasan. The old king, now above eighty
years of age, tried to bear the blow with heroic resignation. He sat in
his court and dispensed justice as usual, but his heart was broken. When
he retired to his private chambers at night he could control himself no
longer and wept freely. Prince Muhammad had a son, Kaikbusrau, and
to this prince Balban now transferred his royal love, and giving him the
canopy and the dirbish, made him the successor of his father at Multan
and his own heir-apparent, in preference to his younger son, Bughra
Khan ‘ for whom he never seems to have had much affection. Kaikhusrau

4 It would appear from Barni’s account that Balban nominated Kaikbusrau
his successor only after Bughra Khan had left him against his wish and had retired
to Lakhnauti (see pp. 121-22 of Tarikb-i-Firoz Shahi), but in one of his elegies on
prince Mohd. Khusrau saya: ‘When Kaikhusrau’s forehead has been chosen for
the crown, may there be a coronet of prosperity on Kaiqobad's head’.

went to Multan and did his best to restore to the city some of its past
splendour and to uphold the tradition of his father. Meanwhile Khusrau
remained in Delhi, or rather Patiyali, with his mother, who was over-
joyed to see her son return home safe from the terrible catastrophe and
covered him with her motherly love and affection.

Balban, after this sad bereavement, had sent for Bughraé Khan from
Lakhnauti, and wanted to keep him beside himself, in his ailing condition
and waning health. But the foolish prince, longing for the unlicensed
pleasures of his court at Lakhnauti, and growing no doubt sick of rigorous
control over himself under the eyes of his puritanic father, soon went
back to Bengal, much against his father’s wish. The old king, however,
got worse soon after his departure, and feeling the end approaching, he
called to his bedside Malik ul-Umara, the veteran kotwal of Delhi, and
the vizier Khwaja Husain, with other nobles, and in their presence
appointed Kaikbusrau heir to his crown and throne.!

But the Malik ul-Umardé, who had a grudge against Prince
Muhammad,? did not want his son to sit on the throne of Delhi. He
saw the prince safely sent away to Multan, and as soon as the aged
monarch closed his eyes and his corpse, taken out from the Red Palace
amid the loud lamentations of the nobles, was consigned to dust, he
announced the accession to the throne of the young son of Bughra
Khan, Mu‘izuddin Kaiqobad.

Thus it was that in the year 685 a.n., Kaiqobad, a handsome youth
of eighteen, came to the coveted throne of Delhi, superseding his own
father and his cousin Kaikhusrau. Accomplished, generous, good-
natured, and with a refined taste for poetry and music, the young prince
had passed the eighteen years of his life under a strict discipline. His
grandfather had appointed over him guardians and instructors who,
while they saw that he acquired all that was necessary for an accom-
plished prince, allowed him no liberty of action. ‘He could not glance
at a fair face or drain a goblet of wine.’* And then, all at once, he
became the king of a rich and prosperous kingdom, the sole master of
fine palaces and beautiful slaves. The result, of course, was what it
usually is in the case of pent desires finding suddenly an outlet. He
gave himself up freely to pleasure, and his nobles followed suit. ‘The
idlers had their day now. Pleasure-hunters, roisterers, joy-seekers,

(B.M. MS. N 0. 25807, fol. 51) ; which shows clearly that Balban had made Kaikhusrau
his heir long before he died.

buffoons and fools, who had been hushed, and had lain in ignominy,
idle and unemployed, found ample work now. Under the shadow of
every wall appeared a peri, and from every balcony a houri displayed
her charms ; in every alley there arose a musician and singer, and from
every quarter a bard and composer raised his head.’ ?

The king soon left the city of Delhi and retired to a fine castle with
beautiful gardens at Kiloghari,2 where his court was thronged with
musicians, dancers, buffoons, and fools. Most of the nobles also built
palaces about the royal residence and their petty courts were as gay
as that of their master. ‘Indulgence and sin prevailed. Mosques
became empty, and the wine-taverns were crowded. No one remained
in the “ ziviyaéhs”’, while tall inns arose on all sides and wine became
ten times as dear as it had been before.’® The assemblies of the king
were resplendent and, unforgettable, and were enlivened by Diya Jhujji
and Husim Darwesh, two famous jesters of the time.

Amir Khusrau, meanwhile, had attached himself to the brilliant
Malik ‘Amir ‘Ali Sarjandaér known as Hatam Khan, but he was soon
invited to the royal court. Amir Khusrau, however, ignored and avoided
the invitation for some time. He was afraid of the machinations of the
cunning minister, Malik Nizimuddin, and had also, perhaps, some
moral scruples in accepting service under Kaiqobad who had supplanted
the son of his former master. Hatam Khan, true to his reputation,
loaded the poet with riches. ‘ From his ocean-like hand ’, says Khusrau,
‘I received so many trays full of gold that they would have enabled
my children and grand-children to live a life of honour and prosperity,

1 Barni, p.129. It was during this period of gaiety and splendour that Khusrau
wrote @ ghazal in which he says: ‘Oh, Delhi and its young beauties with turbans
placed roguishly awry on their heads!..... wherever they stroll the path blooms
forth with moving flowers ..... They stroll along, while in their wake follow their
lovers with bloody tears flowing from their eyes. These saucy young Hindus have
made the Musalmans sun-worshippers..... > (Qiran-us-Sa‘dain, p. 29):

« The poet says himself: (Dib&écha of Ghurratul-Kamél)—‘ The king invited
me, but in those days the chief man in power was Malik Nizimuddin, who, for
some reason, had a grudge against me. I was afraid lest he might entangle me
in some trouble and so sought safety in avoidance, and found a shelter in the shadow

’ of the cloud-like hand of Hétam Khan.’

if I had not squandered away the wealth like worthless atoms but had
stored and saved it ’.1

Malik Nizémuddin, a nephew and son-in-law of Malik-ul-Umara
Fakhruddin, the Kotwal, was a cruel and cunning conspirator, who soon
insinuated himself into the favour of the king and practically ruled the
kingdom. Kaiqobad was content to live peacefully amid wine and music
in his New Palace, ‘a vast paradise, built by the river Jumna, whose
white terraces rubbed their heads against the sky and whose plastered
bricks shone like glass and reflected the beautiful gardens sround
it’.? Niz&émuddin began his despicable career by inducing the king to
send for Kaikhusrau from Multan and to have him killed. The un-
fortunate prince was murdered near Rohtak on his way to Delhi, and
Nizimuddin further succeeded in intimidating all his opponents by a
summary and dishonourable punishment of Khwaja Khatir, the minister,
for some slight breach of discipline.

About this time the Mongols again invaded India and laid waste
the whole of the country between Samana and Lahore. The news
reached the king while, perhaps, he sat in his splendid court amidst
gorgeous surroundings ; rows of richly caparisoned horses, and elephants ;
an artificial garden of gold and silver, rubies, pearls and emeralds, a
rich crown on his head, about his august person a cloak of pearls and
gold brocade, so that pearls glittered all over his body,‘ and he was
roused from his sleep. He despatched one of his generals against them,®
and himself subsided into his wonted stupor.

The Mongols were forced to retreat, after a great slaughter, and a
large number of them were taken prisoner. The victorious general

returned to Delhi with the captives, and the king received him at Tilpat?
with great honour and applause. The heads of the slain Mongols,
mounted on lances, were displayed, then the spoils, consisting of Tartar
horses and arms, and then the prisoners, tied in cords. Most of these
last- were put to death by being thrown under elephants’ feet, and the
rest were ordered to be taken out and paraded in the streets in disgrace.*

Niz&émuddin now added a fresh villainy to his already black record
by obtaining from the king a mandate to put to death the Mongols
who had embraced Islam and had been for some time settled in and
outside the city. He convinced the king that their presence in the
capital was a constant menace to the safety of the kingdom, for they
were rich and powerful and had sympathies with their kinsmen, and
might some day rise in revolt. Thousands of these unfortunate and
innocent persons, men, women, and children, were brutally murdered
or exiled, and their houses destroyed or confiscated. Even those who
had any connection with them, however slight, were imprisoned and
sent to out-of-the-way places far from Delhi.$

Bughraé Khan, in his refuge at Lakhnauti, had heard of his son’s
accession, and had received the news, we may suppose, with a sad and
wistful resignation. He was not ambitious and after all, was it not his
own son, his flesh and blood, who sat on the throne of Delhi,? Moreover,
he remembered his father’s advice to remain true to the fing of Delhi,
whoever he might be. But the black deeds of Nizamuddin, the reckless
life of his son, and the growing discontent all over the country, produced
some effect upon him too. Here was a chance for him to regain the
throne he had lost by his folly.

So the ‘Sun of the East’ marched from Lakhnauti towards the
capital, ‘like a storm with several thousand horsemen and numerous
infantry ’, and crossed the river in large boats ‘ like houses floating on
water’. Kaiqobaid advanced to meet him in the middle of the month
of Rabi-‘ul-Awwal, with ‘an army more numerous than the particles

as ‘the cows and the male buffaloes (i.e. Mongol women and men), etc’. I, however,
think the poet does not mean that. It is very improbable that the invading
Mongols had any women with them and the line is quite capable of the translation
given by Elliot.

in the sunlight ’,' and after three halts, each of which witnessed fantastic
scenes of drinking and merrymaking, reached the Jumna and crossing
the river came to Jeypur.2? Barbek, with other generals, was here
deputed to go in front of the royal army. He crossed the Ganges and
came to the Sari * where he found Bughré Khan’s army encamped on the
other bank. The king also, with his nobles, soon arrived there and
encamped opposite his father’s army. Among the nobles who had
accompanied the king was Hatam Khan. Khban-i-Jahan, the patron
of Khusrau, and the poet thus made his second journey to Oudh, and
saw, with his own eyes,‘ the whole drama of this unnatural conflict
between father and son—a conflict which, however, ended happily. In
his Qiran-us-Sa‘dain he describes at great length all the developments
since the king’s march from Delhi.

The tavo armies, then, lay facing each other, while messages, con-
taining threats couched in polite and affectionate terms, passed between
father and son. Some of the sensible and experienced nobles in both
the camps, however, succeeded in bringing about a reconciliation.
Prominent among these was Shamsuddin Dabir, who had been with
Bughra Khan ever since Balban appointed the latter governor of
Lakhnauti. Bughré Khan sent his son Kaikaus with rich presents
across the river, and in response to this gesture of peace and good will
Kaigobad sent to Bughraé Khan’s camp his infant son, Kiamurth, with
embroidered cloth of Cathay and Iraq, rich silks, youthful slaves, camels,
and precious stones.© The way was now paved for a meeting between
father and son, and on an auspicious day ® Bughra Khan crossed the

appointed governor of Oudh when the king was returning from Lakhnauti, so that
the Khan must have accompanied the king from Delhi and so also Khusrau, who

Khan on beholding his son was moved to tears, and Kaiqobad, equally
affected, got down from his throne, ran to his father, flung himself on
his shoulder, and the ‘two thirsty rivers united—thirsty, though their
eyes were flooded with tears’. The rejoicing was great. Thereafter
several meetings took place between the two princes and their retinues
passed and repassed the river to see friends and to rejoice at the fortunate
close of the episode. Feasting and merrymaking went on for days.
Poets composed odes, and musicians sang them. Khusrau also shared.
in the general happiness.

‘Happy the country when two kings are reconciled, and happy the
assembly where two cups are mingled into one. The son a king, the
father also a sultan—behold now the glory of the kingdom, for two
sultans are one! To rule and govern the world two mighty rulers have
united. One is the Helper of Time, Mahmid Sultan, whose power
extends over the four quarters? of the kingdom, and the other is the
Glory of the World, Kaiqobad, under whose sway Iran and Taran have
become one’.® This is how he celebrates the reconciliation. He had
met there some of his old friends and the few days that the king passed
beside the river Sari were spent in pleasant reunions and gatherings of
literary men in the camps. Khusrau met again his dear friends
Shamsuddin Dabir and Qadi Athir and in a long letter to Najmuddin
Hasan, the poet, he describes the meetings and the visits that they
paid to one another. ‘Happy the day one passes with his dear ones
after a thousand nights and a thousand days of separation ’, he says in it.

Kaiqobid now bade farewell to his father who, at the conclusion
of a last tender meeting, gave his son (as Balban used to give him)
various pieces of advice concerning the reformation. of his conduct and
of the state policy, requesting him especially to do away with Niz&amuddin
who had been his evil genius from the very commencement of his reign.*

Khusrau also returned with the royal army. The rains had now
commenced, and Kaiqobad proceeded slowly. At Gantpore ® he appointed

Hatam Khan governor of the province of Oudh. ‘SoI’, writes Khusrau,
“who am like a ray of that sun, could not return to my home and was
obliged to stay in that country. The peerless malik, in order to obtain
the mandate of governorship, girt up his loins to accompany the royal
stirrup under the auspicious shadow of the canopy and turned me back.
In obedience to the order of that master, I had to sever myself from the
company of my friends in the royal army and to travel back to the
darkness of Hindustan,” the realm of Saturn. It was the rainy season,
and I had to travel during the time when the rains were heaviest... ..
My eyes rained tears at the parting from my friends, and the clouds
wept with me in sympathy. My horse’s foot stumbled in pools of water
and the lightning laughed in mockful glee.... The trickling drops
of rain indicated my tears and the flashes of lightning the burning of
my heart. In this sad plight did I at last reach Oudh.’®

He was not happy there. He longed for Delhi and the friends he
had left behind. In a long letter that he wrote to Tajuddin Zahid from
Oudh, he says: ‘ When I parted from you as shadow deprived of light,
I started on my journey, shedding tears of blood from my eyes. The
heart ached and the eyes longed : the path lay in front but I looked behind.
I went on, but my grief increased and my tears flowed more rapidly
than my feet moved. I had no provisions except sorrow and remembered
naught but yourself. Weeping I started at every stage with the royal
army on the journey, till after a long march of two months when the
king arrived at Oudh, he was pleased to bestow on our Khan the governor-
ship of that province. The city of Oudh‘* was entrusted to the Khan,
and a slow poison was henceforth my food. Though I had no patience
I was forced to stay there. The city of Oudh is, no doubt, charming,
but without you nothing seems pleasant to me. It is a city, nay, a
garden, where one can easily live happy and contented. Its ground is
the ornament of the earth, and its surroundings abound in pleasure.
The river Sari® flows by it, and the mere sight of it quenches one’s

1 Apparently the Malik proceeded to Delhi, sending Khusrau back to Oudh.

2 It is interesting to note that Hindustan, as distinct from Hind which denoted
the whole of India, was the appellation bestowed in those days on the eastern pro-
vinces. Even now the Punjabis call Delhi and the United Provinces of Agra
and Oudh by the name of Hindustan. Khusrau saya in the same letter (to Shams-i-
Dabir who had been living in Lakhnauti) :

thirst. All essentials of happiness are plentiful; flowers and wine are
numerous and abundant. The branches of the trees in its orchards bow
down to the ground with their load of fruit. There are grapes, limes,
pomegranates and oranges, and a hundred other fruits with Indian
names, sweet and luscious, like bananas and mangoes that refresh the
brain. In the gardens there are flowers that bloom for ever, and the
air resounds with the sad, sweet melodies of birds. The milsari, the
chamba, the jai,! crowd the gardens, and there is the kewra like a silver
spear before which the rose lays its life.... Then there are all sorts of
perfumes and spices, sandal, aloe-wood, ambergris, musk, camphor
and cloves, and cloths that redeem the past life, decoration of the person
and ornament of the body—like jhanbartali and bihari that are like a
pleasant gift of spring-tide and sit as lightly on the body as moonlight’

old age made her anxious for his return. ‘The Khan’s kindness’, he
tells us, ‘ rendered the strange land so pleasant that I almost forgot my
own home. For two years I had no concern or anxiety about riches,
but I had left my home and kin simply for the sake of my master.
My mother, now an old, devout woman,! was in Delhi and missed me
very much. She passed her nights and days in restless anxiety and
concern about my worthless self, and in her sorrow and grief at my
separation wrote letters asking me to return. My heart was also full of
pain for her, but I tried to while away my sorrow for some time.2 When,
however, I could control my longing no more, and my yearning could no
further be repressed, I put my case before my master in an application.
The Khan, true to his generosity, saw my helplessness, and willingly
gave me his kind permission to leave for my home. He gave me also
two trays of gold coins to meet the expenses of the journey, so that,
full of gratitude for his magnanimity, I set out on my homeward path.
Fond longing dragged me on, and tears flowed from my eyes,..... and
I had no provisions with me except the anxious desire to see my mother.
I traversed the way like a swift dart or like a flying arrow, making no
halt for a month, for the way was long and the yearning intense, till,
happy like the moon of ‘Id,’ I reached the city of Delhi in the month of
Dhbulqa‘d. Smiling like the rose I cast my hungry eyes on the beloved
faces, satisfying my desire to see my friends and gaining the object of
my heart, as a bird, who has seen the rigours of autumn, comes back
to a spring-tide garden, or a thirsty man reaches the Fountain of Life.

‘My heart that had died with sorrow, revived at the sight of my
dear ones, and with a thousand humble professions of grateful love, I
placed my eyes on my kind mother’s feet. My mother, whom the
separation from me had rendered ill, seeing me, removed the veil from
the face of kindness,‘ and held me in her embrace, shedding tears of joy.
Her afflicted heart was soothed, and she fulfilled the vows she had made.’ ®

he translates this verse as : ‘ Though my heart was wounded at her grief, I did not
like to ask her to come to me ’, which is not at all a correct interpretation.

denote a person whom one sees only after a long time and anxious waiting.

The poet was now again in Delhi. He had, as we have already
seen, refused an offer from Malik NizAmuddin to enter the ranks of the
court poets. The crafty minister was probably still in power,’ and the
young king, who had relapsed into his old habits soon after his return
from Lakhnauti, let him still rule as he pleased. Kaiqobad bade farewell
to his father with promises, perhaps sincere, to reform his conduct,
but he was helpless before the temptations with which his designing
minister managed to surround him. The fame of his fondness for
dancers and musicians, jesters and buffoons, had reached the remotest
parts of the country, and hosts of fair and gorgeously-decked dancing
girls and boys intercepted his advance at every stage of his journey back
to Delhi, displaying their charms and skill to lure the repentant king
back to the paths of folly. The king tried to resist the temptation, but
he failed, and falling a prey to the ‘killing’ eyes of beautiful dancers
and the sparkle of the ruby wine, he sank lower and lower into the depths
of licentious debauchery.”

He had, however, an affectionate nature, and still kept a fond
memory of his father in his heart, and so, soon after Khusrau’s return
to Delhi, he sent for him, asking him to compose a poem commemorative
of his meeting with his father on the banks of the Sari. Khusrau himself
narrates this event as follows :

‘Two days after my arrival in Delhi the news reached the king,
and his chamberlain called on me, giving me the glad tidings of the
king’s desire to see me. I at once rose up and made the requisite
preparations, and composed a fresh panegyric.6 Then I went and laid
my cheek on dust before the king, the body bent in homage and the
heart full of awe. I opened out the poem and recited it in a loud voice,
and when the king heard my fine verses, he diverted his affections from
his other companions, gave me two bags of gold coins, and ordered a
special allowance for me. I was selected to take an honourable position _
among his most favoured boon-companions. When the king had thus
rendered me happy with his generosity and had converted my poverty
into affluence, he spoke thus: ‘‘O Last‘ of the Poets, the remnants of
whose table serve as food for others, we have a favour to ask from you.
If you, with the help of your bright imagination, can satisfy my request,
I shall give you as much gold as you ask for, so that you shall never
feel the pain of want”. When the king’s munificence imparted this

8 He had already composed several odes in praise of the young king.

welcome news to me, T hastened to his presence, swift as wind, with due
homage, and said : ‘ O Jem-like king, the equal of whom the throne! has
never beheld even in dreams, who am I, a grateful slave of yours, that
one like you should ask anything of me? It is you who give to every
beggar what he wants. What could you require from one like me ?
The garden does not seek colour and perfume from the rose, and th
cloud does not borrow water from the drop. Even if the king, whose
sway holds all the world in bondage, asks me my life, it is already his.
Whatever I reap from my twisted mind and dull, weak thought, is only
bad Persian (poetry). If your Majesty’s desire can be fulfilled with
that, I shall count myself fortunate to do so.” When I thus tendered’
before the king the excuse of my incompetence, the king replied thus :
“‘What I desire from you O wizard, is that, heedless of hardships, for
my sake, you give a soul to the lifeless body of poetry by describing the
meeting of the two sultans—that you should compose, with the magic of
your tongue, the story of my encounter with my kind father, so that if the
sorrow of parting overwhelms me, the perusal of that story may calm
my heart’. Saying this, the king made a sign with his eye to the
treasurer. The treasurer hurried me out of the royal presence and gave
me a golden seal (?) 2? and a royal robe. Strange that I should be chosen
for such an honour—that my profit be so heavy while I have no com-
modity in my hand! My pen is innocent of all skill and my paper is
devoid of any rich gloss.’ ®

Nevertheless, Khusrau undertook the task and did it with an
energy, attention, and labour that have made some historians wonder.
Why, they ask, should Khusrau have wasted his energy and time, and
demeaned his art, in the composition of a long and fine poem for the
sake of a monarch like Kaiqobad, a rake and a drunkard ?* But we
must remember that Kaiqobid, in spite of his faults, was a very lovable
man. He was extremely handsome, witty and good-natured, generous
and kind, and very appreciative of merit. Khusrau’s odes on his acces-
sion show a marked feeling of admiration for the unfortunate youth
who, on account of circumstances not entirely in his own control, fell
a victim to his passions and took to courses that soon led him to his
untimely grave. He was, moreover, of very noble birth. His grand-

Yather, Balban, was the son of a daughter of Sultan Shamgyddin Iititmish.,.
‘and he himself was born of a daughter of Nasiruddin Mahmid, the gon of.
Tititmish, so that both his grandfathers were kings.1 Lastly, he was
very generous and was the first king who took Khusrau into his service,
and Khusrau, after all, was not insensible to the great lure of gold and
, gilded yank.

‘T returned ’, he says, ‘to my humble abode from the royal palace
with shame and confusion. My neck bent under the load of pearls,
and it was now my duty to serve the king. With the tablet of my. heart
in my hand, I retired to a corner, my wits confused and my thoughts
scattered. I hid myself from my fellow beings—nay, from both men
and genii. Soon the stream of ideas arose from my heart and the pen
became smoky with the fire of my mind.* As I had placed my trust
in God while busy in thought, my dusty, sordid mind produced a
treasure.’

The treasure was, of course, the well-known mathnawi Qiran-ys-
Sa‘dain which, the poet, according to his own version, completed in
Ramadan, 688 H., after the ceaseless labour of six months. This was
his first long poem, and in some respects perhaps, unique, not only
among the poet’s own works but in the whole range of Persian poetry.‘

The poet who was now thirty-six years old, became henceforth
the poet-laureate of Kaiqobad, but the profligate monarch was already
sinking fast. He had ruined his health by his excesses, and as if in a
foolish attempt to retrieve what he had lost by getting rid of the man
who was to a great extent responsible for this miserable condition, he
had Malik Nizaémuddin poisoned, and invited Malik Jalaluddin bin
Firiz Yaghrish Khalji from his provincial seat at Sémana to take up
the duties of Aridi-Mamalik. The king’s indisposition, however, assumed

a dangerous form and developed into palsy and paralysis, that confined
him to his bed. Meanwhile the nobles were already busy conspiring.
His little son, Kiamirth was proclaimed king by the Turks, but the
Khalji party under Jalaluddin were opposed to the Turkish party,’ and
the rivalry led to bloodshed. The Turks were overpowered and scattered,
and Jalaéluddin became the head of the kingdom as the guardian of the
infant king. He soon got rid of Kaiqobad, who was mercilessly murdered
by a Turk who had some grudge against him, while he lay on his bed a
helpless and hopeless wreck, the mere ghost of his former handsome
self. It was also not long before Kiimirth was set aside, and Jaliluddin
assumed the title of Sultan, exchanging his white umbrella for a black
one ® that had been the royal prerogative of his masters, and thus putting
an end to the dynasty founded by the slaves of the Ghori Sultans. He
was proclaimed king in the new palace of his unfortunate master, which
had witnessed the gay assemblies of Kaiqobad and finally his tragic
death after a brief reign of a little more than three years. The only
other claimant to the throne, ‘Alauddin Muhammad Kishli Khan, the
nephew of Balban, was put out of the way, being appointed governor of
Karra.
CHAPTER III.

Khusrau’s Career under the Khaljis and Ghiydthuddin Tugilag
till his Death in 725 A.H.

In 689,2 then the aged general Firiz Khalji,4 was crowned king.

That Shast! Khan is the correct version is clear from several odes of Khusrau.
Thus, see the odes in Ghurrat-ul-Kamal (1.0. MS., 1186) beg. as

gg oth Glhiey F be 3) ob or
Badaoni (i, 166) gives the name as: ol awl.

1 The leaders of this party were Malik Itmar Kachchan (or Kachan) Barbek
and Malik Itmar Surkba. See Firishta, I, pp. 87-88, and Barni, pp. 171-172.

2 Khushrau briefly alludes to these events in his Ghurrat-ul-Kaméal (Dfbacha)
as follows: ‘His beloved son Shamsuddin (Kiaémuirth) was proclaimed king and
Shasti Khan..... took him under his care and tutelage. I became the ‘Utarid
(secretary) of that auspicious (firuz) sky and his companion. By my good fortune
the azure standard of Firaz Shah was changed into the Black Umbrella and by the
grace of the Almighty he honoured the throne with his glorious feet.’

’ § Khusrau gives the date (Miftah-ul-futih) as the 3rd of Juméad-al-Thant
689, according to Firishta it was the beginning of the year 688 (V. I, p. 89); Barni
also has 688, but 689 is the correct date (Barni, 175) : Khusrau says :

Nab. ‘See Firishta (1..88) and Badaon#/(1. 67).

He was a brave and able man and, like Balban, had passed most of his
life in fighting against the Mongols, who as Khusrau says came to India
again and again only to be despatched back to ‘ Kirm&n ’ -in ignominy.
Modest and diffident, he was almost pushed on to the throne by his
sons, one of whom especially was as ambitious and strong in character
as his father was retiring and shy.1. The Turkish nobles looked askance
at the new monarch and even the inhabitants of Delhi showed openly
their contempt for the Khaljis, and so the king remained at Kiloghari
dreading a visit to the capital. But his virtuous nature and good
temper soon won all hearts, and the refractory and insolent Turks, one
by one, visited the king and paid their homage to their new sovereign.

Jalaluddin finished and enlarged the New Palace built by Kaiqobad,
and soon a city sprung up around the royal residence which acquired
the name of the ‘ New City’. He also built a strong fortress in the New
City,? and having consolidated his position and established his sway, he
at last paid a visit to Delhi. There he went to the Red Palace of Balban,
but as he reached the outer portico he got down from his horse. Ahmed
Chap, his proud and ambitious counsel, remonstrated. ‘The palace is
your Majesty’s now’, he said. But the king silenced him. ‘It is my
master’s’, he replied. ‘Do you think I have forgotten what Iam? For
years I have bowed my head before Balban in this castle and even now
as I entered my heart throbbed with awe and I thought I could see the
mighty king sitting on his throne.’ He did not sit on the throne of
his master, but retired to another part of the palace and held his court
there.

Khusrau, as a court poet, had passed automatically into Jalaluddin’s
service even when the latter was only a regent.* He was henceforth a
part of the royal paraphernalia that changed hands at the death of each
successive monarch and like the black canopy, the crown and the throne,
the palaces, the slaves and elephants became the property of the new
master. But for the pious old monarch Khusrau had a genuine devotion

Some of his odes (e.g. Nos. 1 and 2 in the 1.0. MS., 1186: Ghurrat-ul-Kamal) in
praise of Jaléluddin relate to the latter’s period of regency. The first ode on his
‘accession to the throne (No. 3 in Ibid.) begins :

and love, and the king on his part treated the poet with great honour
and benevolence. He was a poet himself‘and could compose’ elegant
quatrains or ghazals} and was a great admirer of Khusrau’s poetry on
whom. he bestowed the rank of ‘mushafdir’ and the special robe of
‘amarat’, admitting him into the circle of his boon companions. He
also allotted to the poet a pension of 1,200 tangahs annually.?
Jalaluddin was over seventy when he became king and all his life
had passed in wars and campaigns, yet he had a young heart and a
cheerful disposition. His wine-parties were gorgeous. Beautiful slaves
handed round the ‘forbidden ruby’ and_famous singers recited the
ghazals of Khusrau_and Hasan. ‘Each night’, says Barni, ‘ Amir
Khusrau brought new ghazals to the assembly of the king’.® Mohd.
Shah, the famous musician of the time, played and beautiful dancing
girls like Fatiha and Nusrat Khatiin sang ‘ bringing the birds down
from the air and robbing the hearers of their senses ’, while the graceful
dancing of Nusrat Bibi and Mihr Afriiz, their coquettish gestures and
charming motions ‘ spilt a salt-mine on every side’.4 ‘ While the sakis
offered the frothing cups and the beautiful damsels danced and sang,
the ghazals of Amir Khusrau were recited, and in that assembly which
could scarcely be considered as of this earth the lifeless ones got a fresh
life and the sad hearts gladdened.’® One can well appreciate the
splendour and magnificence of these parties by the sad, longing lament
of Barni who, as a young man, was often present in them. ‘I, the old
sinner’, he says, ‘wandering in the desert of disappointment and
reduced to almost a breath of air or a whiff of smoke, wish, when writing
the description of these assemblies, to wear the zone and put the Brahmins’
“* tika ’’ ® on my accursed forehead in memory of those handsome youths

and alleys a target to derision and disgrace, and sixty years after their
disappearance go out lamenting, rending my clothes and tearing the hair
of my head and beard, and lay my life beside their graves.’ 1

While, however, the king’s kind heart and genial temper delighted
all, his excessive lenience and forbearance made the mischievous
truculent. ‘ He is all right’, they said, ‘for fighting the Mongols, but
as to ruling an empire—well it is beyond him’. In the wine-parties of
some of these bragging malcontents there were wild talks about the
king and his inefficiency. The king heard everything, but ignored it,
and even when some of the nobles conspired to kill him he called them
to his presence, threw his sword before them and challenged any one of
them to raise his hand and strike if he durst. The conspirators were
shamed. and humbled and blabbed ‘out excuses. The king forgave them
all to the great scandal and indignation of his ministers.”

The two great events of his reign were the revolt at Karra of Malik
Jhujhu, ‘Alauddin Mohd. Kishlikbin, and the conquest of Jhain, a
fortress near Rantambhir, and Khusrau in his ‘ Miftéh-ul-Futih’ des-
cribes both of them. Malik Kishli Khan, as we have seen, was the
nephew of Balban and considered himself to be the rightful heir to the
throne. He was, moreover, incited by other Turkish nobles to take
advantage of the king’s gentle and peaceful nature, and to raise the
standard of revolt. In the second year of Firiz’s reign the malik
declared his independence and assuming the title of Mughithuddin®
and collecting a large army mainly from amongst the Hindus‘ of his
province advanced towards Delhi. The king, hearing of this, sent his
brave and fiery son Arklik® Khan with a strong detachment to meet

1 Barni, p. 200.

® For this incident see Barni, pp. 190-191. The conspiracy was formed in a
wine-party in the house of Tajuddin Kich!, a great malik who was proposed to be
the next king, and among the conspirators was another great malik, Nusrat Sabah,
Sardawatdar (or Chief Secretary).

8 It is curious that Tughril, who rebelled in Oudh in Balban’ 8 time, had also
assumed the same title.

sworn allegiance to him’,

the enemy and himeelf followed close with the main army. Khusrau
was with the king and witnessed the various developments of the
campaigns.

Arklik Khin advanced quickly and crossing the Jumna and the
Ganges reached the Rahab’ where the enemy was encamped. The
two armies lay face to face for some days on opposite banks of the river
and skirmishes went on. One night, however, the malik fled. The
prince following soon overtook him and forced him to fight, cutting off
his retreat. The demoralized and feeble soldiers of the malik were
easily defeated and he escaped with a few followers, but was hunted
down and brought with his confederates bound in pillories,? their clothes
torn and dusty and their faces begrimed, seated on camels. The monarch,
when he saw this, covered his face with the lapel of his robe and cried
out: ‘ Fie, what is this! Remove at once the pillories.’ They were
taken off the camels to the bath, were supplied fresh clothes, and the
king sat with them, drinking wine and asking them to drink it with
him. They cast down their eyes in shame. Malik Jhujhii was sent to
Multan with great honour and all the other nobles, except Alp Ghazi,‘
were pardoned.

The king then returned through Lakhnauti clearing the forest of
Tarshina> and destroying the robbers who had made it their stronghold.
At Anbithi he subjugated the Raja Nipal ® and proceeded on to Kahsiin ”
and Balaghatrak, whence he ultimately reached Siri. The king stayed
there for the whole month of Safar resting and enjoying himself, and
preparing for the expedition to Jhain. ‘Although wine was taboo during
the journey ’, says Khusrau, ‘ the king was not without the pleasures of
music. Sometimes he listened to the verses of his companions, and
sometimes sought new and fresh melodies from the musicians. On one
side this humble slave sung the praises of the generous and on the other
the skilful Mohd. Shaih® intoxicated the senses with his musical
performances.’ ®

and sundry and red canopies with gold ‘ dirbishes’ on Khan Khanan
and Arkalik Khan, the elder sons of the king, and a gorgeous pearl-
studded robe and a sapphire coloured standard on Ruknuddin Ibrahim
Qadar Khan, the youngest son, the king hoisted his flag from Siri.
Marching through Lahrawat,! Chandiwal, Rewari, Narnol? and
Banihan,* the king at last reached Jhain. Sahinin,‘ the rajah’s brave
general, met the royal forces, but after a hard struggle he fell dead and
the fortress was captured, the rajah taking flight. The king occupied
the palace and gardens of the rajah, ‘ beautiful as paradise’ ® and cleared
the temples of all its idols. The fort was destroyed and heaps of plunder
fell to the lot of the conquerors including two brass images of Brahma.
Appointing two of his generals, Malik Khurram and Sarjandér Mahmid
to pursue the rajah and plunder the country around, the king proceeded
to the river Chambal, and by slow marches passed through Bayina and
Siri and finally entered Delhi, where he was accorded a fine reception
by his subjects.®

The king’s gentle nature did not permit him to shed the blood of
his subjects in further conquests and he gave up the idea of reducing the
strong fortress of Rantambhur.” ll his ministers argued with him in
vain. Even Khusrau in his odes tried to urge the king to be more
energetic. ‘O you that have raised high your standard’, he says,
* you shall conquer the whole world and in one stroke capture the seven
realms ..... Wield. your sword, O King, for with the sword you will
get what you like from the world as soon as you desire it..... Your
slave, Khusrau, prays that you may conquer Hindustan as you have
conquered Khorasan.’* But the king was unmoved. He loathed
bloodshed and disliked cruelty. He could not be severe to anyone

and released even the ‘thugs’ who were brought before him? and used
to threaten his refractory nobles, not of his own anger,? but of the wrath
of his second son, Arkalik Khan. ‘ You know how hot-tempered he is.
Beware lest he hear of what you say about me! ’

He had to suffer in his old age the loss of his eldest son, Khan-i-
Khanan, whom he had appointed his heir and successor, and Khusrau
has commemorated the event by a fine elegy. The death of the prince
was considered by some of the superstitious people to be a punishment
for the murder of a darwesh, Sidi Milah, who, as the central figure in a
conspiracy against the king, was brutally done to death by other rival
darweshes in the presence of the king. This was, perhaps, the only
deed of stern judgment on the part of Jalaluddin, and he was instigated
to it by his son Arkalik Khan who supervised the murder from a balcony
and asked an elephant-driver to finish Miilah as he fell down wounded
by trampling him under his elephant’s feet.‘

The invasion of the Mongols under Alghii Khan in 692 H. was
another event of importance during his reign. The Mongols were defeated
and Alghu Khan, with four thousand of his followers embraced Islam.
He was married to a daughter of the king and the converts settled down
in Ghiathpitr.

The old and pious monarch’s reign, however, was now drawing to a
close. He was too good, too gentle and too unsophisticated to be
allowed to occupy the throne for long. In the year 691,5 when he

returned to the capital after an ineffectual expedition against the strong
‘fortress of MandAwar,) his nephew and son-in-law, ‘Aliuddin Khalji, the
‘ ‘governor of Karra, laid before him the plunders of a raid on the country
round about Bhilsa * and sought his permission for further expeditions
against Chanderi. The king, immensely pleased by his nephew’s exploits,
readily granted him leave to start. ‘Alaéuddin, however, wanted to go
away from Delhi, not only in the hope of rich plunders, but more,
perhaps, in order to get rid of his proud wife and her prouder mother,
Malika-i-Jahén, who had always been a source of mental torment to him,
but against whom he could scarcely utter a word for fear of incurring
the king’s displeasure. He was, moreover, already hatching a plot to
make a bid for the throne, and was in league with the discontented nobles
who had taken an active part in the revolt in Oudh of Malik Jhujhi.
Taking a number of such chiefs in his service and recruiting fresh soldiers,
‘Alauddin returned to Karra and soon started from there, with the
ostensible intention of raiding Chanderi,’ with a few thousand trusty
soldiers. His objective was, however, quite different. The lands of
Berar and Deccan had so far been immune from the tread of the Turkish
soldiers. Their peaceful cities were stored with riches and wealth that
had accumulated for centuries. There was gold and silver untold in
the coffers of the rajahs, and diamonds and pearls, horses and elephants
in incredible numbers. The fame of these treasures had reached the
ear of the ambitious malik. He wanted money to make his plan a
success and here was a mine of riches awaiting exploitation.

He marched with his army so swiftly and so secretly that no one
had an inkling of his plans and all at once appeared before the walls of
Deogir, through Elichpur. The rajah was taken by surprise, and
although his son fought valiantly against the invaders, ‘Alauddin suc-
ceeded in completely cutting off Deogir from the surrounding country
and rendering all succour or supply of provisions impossible, thus com-
pelling the rajah to agree to the torms he dictated to him. _ These included
the payment of a ransom to the invaders consisting of six hundred mans ¢
of gold, seven mans of pearls, two mans of diamonds, emeralds and
rubies, a thousand mans of silver, countless bundles of silk cloth and

other precious products of Deccan, together with the revenue of Elichpur
and its dependencies, elephants and horses.! Loaded with these rich
spoils, ‘Alauddin returned to Karra and the news of his successes reached
his unsuspecting uncle, Jalaluddin while the latter was at Gwaliyar®
‘Aléuddin’s conduct had roused the suspicions of some of the wise coun-
sellors of the king. The faithful minister, Ahmed Chap, especially saw
the menace that lay in the possession of so much wealth by ‘Alauddin
and he advised the king to advance and intercept ‘Alaéuddin’s return to
Karra and thus compel him to surrender the treasures to his master.
The king, however, in his affection and enthusiasm for his nephew, dis-
regarded the advice and returned to Delhi, thus allowing ‘Alauddin to
proceed to his safe retreat in Karra and Oudh with resources that, in
the words of Ahmed Chap, were sufficient for the foundation of seven
kingdoms?

From Karra, ‘Alauddin commenced a campaign of crafty corres-
pondence, telling the king of his successes, expressing his fears of the
royal displeasure at his unauthorized conduct and asking the king’s
forgiveness. His brother, Almas Beg, another son-in-law of the king,
was his spy and confederate at the royal court and told the king all
sorts of sentimental things about his brother—how he was burning
to see his beloved uncle, but durst not come to Delhi for fear, how he
always carried poison in his handkerchief to end his life at the slightest
manifestation of the king’s wrath, and how faithful and true and repentant
he was. The king, in his innocence and simplicity, sent Almas Beg to
Karra, telling him to console his brother and assure him of immunity.
The two brothers now together succeeded in drawing the king into a
trap laid cleverly and with cruel precision and calculation. He was
persuaded to visit Karra to receive the homage of his nephew and the
treasures he had brought from Deogir. The fatherly affection of the
old monarch, his childish simplicity and his cupldity for gold, led him
blindfolded to his fate. Leaving behind his army and crossing the river
with a few followers, fasting and reciting the Koran, he reached the

Ceylon itself’.

other bank where his nephew had encamped with his army ready for all
eventualities, the soldiers and elephants armed and standing at attention.
As he got down from the boat, ‘Alauddin advanced and threw himself
at his feet and the king lifted him up and embraced him with words of
affection, dragging him towards the boat to take him back to the royal
camp. But, under ‘Alduddin’s instructions, he was attacked by a
ruffian,! who wounded him, and as the king ran towards the river another
ruffian,? pursuing, threw him down and cut his head. The gory head
with its white beard was hoisted on a lance and paraded in Karra.
Ahmed Chap, hearing of the disaster, hastened back to Delhi. He had
done his best to prevent this, but the king never listened to him. Arkalik
Khan, the valiant and able son of the murdered king, was in Multan.
His mother, Malika-i-Jahin, without waiting for his arrival at Delhi,
announced her youngest son, Ibrahim Ruknuddin’s accession to the
throne, and Arkalik Khan, offended at this slight, remained away at
Multan. The only formidable rival being thus put out of his way,
‘Alauddin had no difficulty in scattering the forces of the young prince
Ibraihim,® whose army deserted him and who, with his mother and the
faithful minister, Anmed Chap, was forced to take shelter with his elder
brother in Multan. ‘Alauddin thus entered the city of Delhi unopposed.
He had started from Karra, scattering gold and silver on his way, and
winning all hearts with his generosity. As he advanced towards Delhi,
his camp was preceded by a catapult that flung stars of gold on the
large crowds that gathered from far and near to watch the triumphal
march after the wonderful coup d’etat. ‘Alauddin sought to wash away
with gold the blackness of his vile treachery, and such is human nature
that men soon forgot the gentle and virtuous king whose old head on

the spear-head still cried for vengeance, and welcomed the new monarch
with great enthusiasm. Our poet, Khusrau, was one of the first to
offer his congratulations to the murderer whose hands were still red with
the blood of his king, his uncle and his benefactor, who had brought
him up like his own child from his infancy, and had always been nothing
but kind to him. The poet, like so many others, changed with the
changing time and turned with the shifting wind. In a long ode that
he had composed in honour of Firiz Khalji, he had said: ‘If the great
master, Khaqini boasted of the glories of Sherwan, I proclaim the
splendours of India. His king, Jalaluddin,! the king of Sherwan, and
the majesty and gold crown of that king are alike dust now. But may
our Jalaluddin remain for ever at the head of our glorious kingdom and
may his generous deeds pass into history through our praises of them.’ ®
Yet no sooner did his nephew, shaded by the royal umbrella wrenched
from the hands of the murdered king’s attendants, approach the capital
than Khusrau wrote and presented to him a panegyric congratulating
him on his success and promising him the throne and khutba of Delhi :—
‘May you be blessed with the glory of the khutba of Delhi: This
happy augury I draw from the nine lots of the skies ’, is how the poet
greets ‘Alauddin.

‘Alauddin ascended the throne of Delhi on Tuesday, the 22nd of
Dhulhijja, 695 u.4 He gave the title of Ulugh Khan to his brother,

from one of his mathnawis addressed to him in which he says: ‘ Was I not the
first to congratulate you on your. accession to, the throne? Behold my auspicious
prophecy for fate has given you the throne of Delhi!’ (I.0. MS., 1187; fol. 8176 seq.)

Almis Beg, and that of Alp Khan to his brother-in-law, Sanjar. Two
other great supporters of his cause were Malik Nusrat and Malik
Badruddin? and they were honoured with the titles of Nusrat Khan
and Zafar Khan respectively. ‘Alauddin’s daring expedition to Deogir,
and his more daring and dramatic coup-de-main that had secured him
the crown, had almost dazzled and bewildered the people. He had
advanced to the throne, as Khusrau says, ‘ with sword in one hand and
gold in the other, crowning heads with the latter and severing them
with the former ’.? All at once, he ascended the throne in Delhi, while
all the world wondered at the strange occurrence. ‘ How could anyone’,
they asked, ‘seize Delhi coming from Karrah?’ People talked and
whispered, saying there never had been a fortunate man like him?
All opposition was hushed by his military prowess and all grumbling
mouths were sealed with gold, and the only thorn in his side now was
the presence in Multan of his cousins, Jalailuddin’s sons,‘ against whom
-he soon despatched, with strong forces, his brother, Ulugh Khan and
Zafar Khan. ‘ All the lucky ones’, says Khusrau, ‘ bowed down before
the king—all except the ill-starred Mir of Multan.® As that enemy was
not of sufficient importance for the king to march himself against him,
Ulugh Khan started to remove that obstacle from the way. An army
arranged like the stars from which even the sky sought protection
moved on like raining clouds flooding the world with the waves of the
sword. When the enemy heard of this strong army, he concealed himself
into the wall of misery like an ant® and Ulugh Khan advanced to
accomplish his task. He came to the ramparts of the fortress and
wanted to send the enemy to the abyss and lay him low in the dust
with the strokes of his catapults.’ But when he considered that both
parties were Musalmans he curbed his hasty wrath. The besieged also
did not consider it proper that a mote should contend with the sun,
and after a resistance of two or three weeks they got sick of their mis-
guided chief. The generals of the army, after a consultation, came

out of the fortress asking pardon and amnesty. Then the enemy was
afraid of his misfortune and sought strength from the saints.!_ One of
these saints brought the two errant princes with him and handed them
over to the king’s commanders, so that the auspicious Khan turned
towards the threshold of the king with victory and success.’ Khusrau
is silent about the fate of the unfortunate princes, but we know that
they were blinded and ultimately put to death. Even the two young
sons of Arkalik Khan were murdered, so that ‘Alauddin could hence-
forth rule without fear of any rival-claimant to the throne. His power
was now firmly established, and his court * was thronged by great and
renowned nobles. For a time he gave himself up to pleasure and drank
immoderately, but he soon got sick of wine and renounced it altogether.
He now formed fantastic ideas about founding a new religion and going
around on a tour of world-wide conquest like the great Alexander of
yore, and in fact affected the title of Sikandar-i-Thani (the second
Alexander), but happily he had wise counsellors who pointed out to
him, with due humility and deference, the uselessness of such plans
and advised him to strengthen his kingdom and to increase his power
by further conquests in India itself.

But before ‘Aléuddin could commence his campaigns of conquest,
he had to deal with the Mongols who seem to have missed no opportunity
of invading India. They were especially attracted to this country during
periods of political’ changes and upheavals, and Jalaluddin’s murder
gave them another opportunity.

Early in 697 H. Kadar, a Mongol chieftain, invaded India with a
large army, and advancing from the Jidi mountains and crossing the
Beas, the Jehlum and the Sutlej,5 advanced towards Qasur and Jaran-
Manjir.6 Ulugh Khan was deputed by ‘Alauddin to meet him and he
defeated and scattered the Mongols on the 22nd of Rabi‘-ul-Thani
697 H. Many were captured and slain.

1 The original has Khilwat-Nashinién (dwellers of solitude). The princes,
finding their position untenable, beseeched some of the saints in Multan to interfere
and intercede for them with Ulugh Khan. Sheikh Ruknuddin, son of Sheikh
Sadruddin, delivered them up to Ulugh Khan after the latter had promised to
spare their lives. See Badaoni, I, 183; Barni, 249. ,

In 698 #., Ulugh Khan and Nusrat Khan were despatched on an
expedition against Gujarat, with an army ‘like the raining cloud’.
Ulugh Khan, as ‘the angel in charge of clouds’, proceeded towards the
sea and conquered the country ‘ bedecked as a bride’, after a great
slaughter so that ‘in celebrating the total destruction of the Hindus,
even the beasts ate tanbiil! and dyed their feet with henna’. The idols in
the Somnat temple were destroyed and cast into the sea, but the biggest
of them was spared and sent to Delhi, ‘ and in that old land of unbelief
the cry of the muezzin rose so loud that it could be heard in Baghdad
and Madayan * and the music of the ‘Aldi Khutba ® vibrated so mightily
that it reached the dome of Khalil‘ and the well of Zamzam. Khambiayat
and Nahrwalah were captured and plundered and the strong fortress
of Rantambhur was then besieged. The Hindus put up here a stout
resistance and the siege lasted for almost five months. But the hot
and dry weather and shortage of provisions began at last to tell upon
the garrison. Food was so scarce that ‘they bought a grain of rice
for two grains of gold’. The brave rajah® in despair at last performed
the ‘jauhar’, burning his women-folk in a huge pyre lit on a hill top
and himself came out of the fortress and fell dead fighting heroically.
The fort thus fell into the hands of the besiegers on the 3rd of Dhulga‘da

them huge spoils gathered from palaces and temples and the coffers
of rich merchants in Cambay (Khambiayat), but, perhaps, the most
valuable of these spoils were Kanwladi, the beautiful queen of Rajah
Karn of Nahrwallah and Malik M&nik,! a handsome slave who later
became known as Malik Kafir Hazardinari. Kanwladi entered the
harem of the sultan, where she exercised a good deal of influence, and
Malik Kafir soon became the most favoured servant of the king and
the object of his perverse and unnatural affection.

Khusrau had already entered the service of ‘Alauddin and, when
in the year 702 H. the king himself started for the conquest of Chitor,
Khusrau accompanied him. The king left Delhi on the 8th of Jumad-al-
Thani and the siege lasted a long time, the fortress falling after a long
and stubborn resistance on the 11th of Muharram, 703 u. The rains
made the task of the besiegers considerably more difficult and the poet
must have been exposed to many hardships in the royal camp. He says,
“I, who am the bird of this Sulaiman, was with him and although they
often told me to go back to Delhi I remained there, fearing the dis-
pleasure of my master who may have said’: ‘‘ How is it I do not see the
hoopoe? Is he then absent ?”* and I was afraid I would not be able
to explain my absence nor to have the strength to reply to the royal
order: “He should bring me a clear proof (of his innocence) ”’.’®
He remained, then, with the king till the fort surrendered, and saw the
slaughter of the unfortunate Hindus, thirty thousands of whom, according
to him, were slain in one day. The life of the rajah was, however, spared.
‘Chitor was named Khidr-abad, after the name of the prince, Khidr
Khan, who was given a red umbrella and appointed governor of the’
district, and the king turned back to the capital.‘ Soon after his return
to Delhi, ‘Alauddin had to face another Mongol invasion, the third
during his reign. The second invasion under Qutlugh Khwaja had
taken place in 698,5 when the enemy almost reached the walls of Delhi

1I am not quite certain about the identification of Malik Manik with Malik
Kafir. Badaoni considers them to be identical. The name is given as Nayik or
‘Tatak in Barni. Khusrau refers to Malik Manik in his account of the fights with
the Mongols. (See infra.)

al-futih, though he alludes to it in his ‘Ashiga :

and the king had to march out himself. The Mongols were defeated,
but Zafar Khan, the brave genefal, lost his life while pursuing them—
much to the relief of the king, who was becoming jealous of his growing
popularity and afraid of his heroic courage. This time the Mongols,
led by Targhi, came in great strength and actually besieged the capital.
There was great distress in the city owing to large numbers of refugees
pouring in from all sides and shortage of foodstuffs, and the king had
not sufficient forces at his command to raise the siege. After two
months, however, the Mongols, as if by a miracle, raised the siege them-
selves and retreated.*

In 705 a. ‘Ali Beg and Turtaq ? with Targhi invaded India again.
Targhi, however, soon retired, leaving the two Mongol princes to advance
into the interior.2 With an army of fifty thousand horse they advanced
right up to the Siwaliks, burning and slaying and reaching Amroha.
Malik Manik was sent to fight against them and on the 10th of Jumad-al-
Thani the two armies met. The Mongols were again defeated and both
the leaders were taken prisoner and brought to Delhi with large numbers
of their followers. Most of the latter were put to death and their heads
and bodies built into the towers and walls of‘ Siri, but the princes were
spared and allowed to live in Delhi, where one of them soon died.‘

Soon after, Kabak again marched across the Indus, burning with
thoughts of revenge for the reverses suffered by his kinsmen, and pro-
ceeded far into Hindustan till he came to Nagor. Malik Kafir led an

while some thought it was due to a miracle of the Hes himself whom they believed

2 Firishta gives the second name as Tarpal, while it is found elsewhere as Taryaq,
but Turtéq or Tartéq is probably the correct reading. (Vide Firishta, I, 114.)

army against him and, routing the Mongols, captured Kabak, and ‘ the
trained dog with a collar round his neck’! was brought to Delhi.

The fifth and’ last invasion of ‘Alauddin’s reign was made by the
Mongols under Igqb&l and Tay-bi,? who ‘came thirsting for the blood
of the Musalmans’. Malik Kafir with Malik Ghazi (Tughlaq) routed
again the enemy and pursued him across the Indus slaying large numbers.
Hundreds of prisoners were brought to Delhi and were thrown under
elephants’ feet or hanged from turrets and battlements so that ‘the
Chinese and the Tartars hung from the walls as negroes head downwards
from a new building’.® A lofty tower was built with their heads and
limbs used as bricks.

These successive reverses damped the Mongols’ ambition for the
plunder and possession of the rich lands of India and for a time they
gave up their usual incursions into the country. The inhabitants of
India breathed a sigh of relief and gloated over the hideous murders of
the captive Mongols or their kinsmen, the ‘Neo-Muslims’, who had
settled in India and who were slaughtered wholesale after a conspiracy
formed by some of them had been detected. Khusrau, who shared the
sentiments of the populace and who had, moreover, a special grudge
against the Mongols, ever since his captivity in Multan, seems to have
been very jubilant over their reverses and to have really enjoyed th
sight of the tortures that they were subjected to. His works are strewn
thickly with tirades against them and with hymns of gratitude for the
punishments ‘meted out to them by God’. He says in an ode
addressed to ‘Alauddin: ‘O thou who hast carried the flag of victory
and success over the four quarters of the globe, thine Hindu slaves
have struck at the very heart of Turkestan!*..... Glory be to God,

one would think, are like a lover embracing fondly the neck of the
beloved with his two arms.’* While speaking of the persecution of the
Mongols in India, he says: ‘ The headless ones who each year brought
the chains of hardship given by Timur Qiq to take prisoners from India
were themselves either cut down by the sword and sent to hell or taken
prisoner and spared. But as those who were thus liberated tried to
break their chains and to raise disturbances, the king ordered some of
them to be thrown into the river and a rain of blood was made to pour
on the earth from the necks of others and their wheat-coloured * bodies
were buried in the ground so that red roses and cocks-combs sprung
from their ashes. Then with the heads of the Mars dogs® they built
up a tower..... In the other distant parts of the country also similar
towers were raised.’ ® ;

‘Alauddin now took no more chances about further inroads of the
Mongols. He had seen that the capital itself was not immune against
their encroachments, and he started repairing the decaying ramparts,
and, at the same time, built another strong fortress at Siri. Fortresses
all over the route of the Mongols were also overhauled and rebuilt and
manned, with strong garrisons. Having thus secured the country against
foreign invasions, he turned towards the internal administration. The
mighty monarch had very early in his royal career cowed the nobles
and filled their hearts with awe, yet he had to face two or three un-
pleasant risings against his authority. He was once very nearly killed
by his nephew, Akitkhin, when out on a hunting expedition,’ and at
another time, while he was away on a campaign against the fortress of
Rantambhur, a freed slave of the old Kotwal Amir-ul-‘Umara

were often restless and troublesome.1 He sought to root out all sedition
and so consulted his advisers. The two main causes of restiveness and
turbulence, he was convinced, were wine and riches. He renounced
wine and prohibited its use all over his kingdom. Taverns became
deserted and kegs and tubs of the red juice were emptied into gutters
so that the streets overflowed with it. Elephants were employed to
consume huge quantities of the precious vintage that had lain stored
in the royal cellars, so that the old historian, Firishta, says with a sigh :
‘Happy the elephants of those days who thus enjoyed themselves! ’?
He took steps to check the accumulation of wealth among merchants
and nobles, suppressed profiteering and bribery and formed a market
called the Dar-ul-‘Adl,3 where all the traders and merchants had to sell
their goods at prices fixed by the king. All cases of fraud or infringement
of the rules laid down were strongly and summarily dealt with.
‘Alauddin would test from time to time the prices in the market and
act himself like a ‘muhtasib’.t He did not, it is true, go himself to
the market disguised as an old woman in a flowing veil to detect male-
factors, but he employed methods equally original and efficacious. He
would, for instance, give a small coin to a boy of tender age and ask
him to go and buy a certain commodity in the market and bring it intact
to him. He would then weigh and measure it, and woe to the seller
who thought of preying upon the innocent ignorance of the child! 5
‘The justice of Omar’, says Khusrau, ‘had to wait for seven hundred
years before it found a new patron ’.®

Himself, probably, caring little about religion, and knowing less, he,
a8 the head of the state, took strong measures against the spread of
immorality and heresy that had grown freely during the reigns of Kaiqobad
and Jalaluddin. ‘Women of the city who went about spreading the
snares of their curly locks and roamed at will in the town were all
compelled to retire to seclusion, and renouncing their evil ways they
rubbed their hands in repentance while twisting the threads’ of their

veils.’ A heretic sect, the Ibahatiya,! of whose evil ways the king;
heard, was persecuted and suppressed, and all heresy disappea:
that even the ‘ fish that arose from the rivers was sunni’. Even wisi
and witches did not escape the king’s attention. ‘The blood-th
sorcerers, the man-eating hyenas, who sharpened their teeth to conf
the flesh and blood of children and relished the blood that they swallé
were punished and men pelted their skulls with stones and ext@
from their heads indemnity for the blood they had drunk.’?
‘Alaiiddin then turned his attention towards public buildings
Delhi. The ancient capital had seen many changes since the timé af
Aybek and Iltitmish who had built the famous mosque ‘ which: all
nations acknowledged as their Ka‘ba and to which even the Black Stone:

and later as the New City. ‘Alauddin, having constructed a fortress. & L

were enclosed by two walls that joined them and had ee ee

once in his writings. Ibahatiya or Ahl-i-Ibabat literally means those who riake ot:
consider lawful such things as are unlawful according to orthodox religion.” tein,
Shah Tughlaq (Futihat : Elliot, iii, 378) also mentions them, and according to:
Khusrau their evil practices included carnal relations among brothers and sisters,
parents and children, and so forth. They were probably the Carmathians who were:
found in large numbers in Western India in those days. 3

‘Alauddin ordered the extension of the mosque, the great Jami‘
Masjid. A fourth ‘ maqsira ’* was added to the three already existing.
Then the king ‘thought of constructing a replica to the pillar of the
mosque which was unique in the world..... He first ordered a vast
space to be enclosed in the court of the mosque so that the throng of
the faithful which, by the grace of God, finds the world too narrow
for itself, may get ample place in it, and commanded that the oir-
cumference of the new pillar be twice that of the old one and its top be
proportionately high so that the top of the old one may look like the
central gallery of the new one.’ Stones were brought from far and
near, from quarries and demolished Hindu temples and ‘the stone-
carvers of Hind who shamed even Farhad with their skill in stone-work,
rendered the faces of the stones so smooth that imagination itself would
slip on them. The masons of Delhi who considered even Nu‘min-i-
Mundhir? to be a mere block-head in the art of building..... joined
stone with stone in such a manner that the fancy of a Rhazes*® could
not penetrate their joints.’ But ‘Alauddin never lived to finish the
pillar which still lies incomplete, 2a monument to the vanity of human
ambition.‘

The Shamsi tank next received his attention. This tank, which
supplied the city with water, had become choked and dry. ‘Alauddin
built a domed roof over it and had it cleared so that ‘the hand of every
digger becoming the staff of Moses’, the tank was again full of water,

and the white pavilion in its middle with its reflection ‘looked like an
ostrich egg one half above and the other below water ’.?

Having thus secured peace and prosperity in his vast dominions,
the king again thought of the fertile lands of Deccan whence he had
obtained such rich plunders in his first raid. Ram Deo still ruled at
Deogir and as he had been rather lax in the regular payment of the
tribute levied upon him, the king found a ready pretext for invading
his territory. Malik Naib Kafir, the great Barbek, was consequently
sent to Deogir with a large army to ‘ bring the rajah to his senses’. K&afir
reached Deogir on 19 Ramadan, 706 H. and routed the forces of Rimdeo’s
son who had to fly for his life. Deogir surrendered soon after ; and the
Barbek, taking with him immense booty and Ramdeo himself returned
to the capital. ‘ For six months the rajah, pardoned by the king, bent
his body like the crescent-moon in the service of the king’, and after
that the king, bestowing on him a blue? chatr, sent him back with all
honour to his country and throne.

While Malik Kafir was away on this expedition, the king himself,
feeling no doubt restless after a long period of inaction, had marched
out to Siwana, a fortress hundred farsangs from Delhi? It was held by
a ‘ gabr’ Sutuldeo, ‘who lay concealed in this mountain fortress like a
griffin while several thousand other gabrs like hill-vultures perched
themselves about him on the hillside, awaiting their destruction and
opening their mouths like the stone-eating birds,‘ till the stones of the
royal catapults flew at them’. The ‘ gabrs’,® nevertheless, offered a
stout resistance and it was only after about two months’ hard fighting
that the fortress fell and Sutuldeo was killed. The territory was allotted
to Malik Kamaluddin Gurg and the king returned to Delhi.

sightseers and excursionists. According to the Malfuzét of Khwaja Bakhtyar
Kaki, the site of the tank was pointed out to Iltitmish by the Prophet in a dream.

or ‘of sky colour’ (fol. 320). I have followed Khusrau in the following accounts
of the southern conquests. Barni and Firishta agree with him in all important
details.

8 So according to Firishta. Amir Khusrau says that the king started on this
expedition in 708 H. in the month of Muharram (Khazain, fol. 33). The fortress
was apparently named Khairibad after its conquest, for the poet says :

the sense of an unbeliever or infidel (cf. ‘Ashiqa, pp. 81-82).

In 709 u. Malik Kafar started on his campaigns in the @xtreme
south. The king sent him off with great preparations, with a red
umbrella, a red canopy and a numerous army. He reached Mas‘iidpur ?
on the 9th day. Crossing the rivers Jumna, Chambal, Kanwari, Banas
and Bhoji* in six days, the army reached Sultanpir or Irajpur, and
after a halt of four days there, resumed the march. Thirteen days after
Khandar was reached on the first of Rajab. After another eight days
of difficult marches through hilly country, crossing numerous streams,
among them the Narbada that seemed to be a remnant of the Deluge,
the army arrived at Nilkanta, in the territory of Deogir. The Rajah
greeted the royal standard and supplied all necessary provisions for the
army. Kafiir now advanced further south, and crossing a very difficult,
rocky country came to a place between two rivers, the Basanhar and
Baji, near Baseragar, where, they told him, there was a diamond mine.
But ‘as the strong warriors dig out diamonds with their swords and
not with pickaxes’, the Malik proceeded on till he arrived before the
fortress of Sirbar ° in the territory of Tilang.t The brother of the ruler,
Ananiz by name, was captured, the fortress reduced, and the rajah
burnt himself to death.

On the 14th of Sha‘ban, the country of Konarbal> was reached,
whence Kafiir despatched a party of a thousand horsemen to recon-
noitre the country and to find out the way to Arangal.® They reached
the hill of Anum-Kanda,’ and saw from it the fortress and city of
Arangal, its suburbs and gardens. Malik Kafir joined the advance-
guard soon, pitched the red canopy near Anum-Kanda and besieged the
strong fortress that had two formidable ramparts, the outer one of
mud, and the inner one of brick, so high that ‘ its turrets rose up in air
and soared up to the moon while its bottom passing below water reached
the fish’. The royal army after a hard struggle broke through the outer

defenceaand compelled the rajah, Luddar Deo,! to sue for peace. He
sent to the Malik an image of himself in gold with a rope round its neck
in token of surrender and a humble request that his life be spared.
‘If the king’, he said, ‘ desires treasures and presents, I have of gold
enough to gild all the mountains of Hind, and it is at bis service. But
if the world-decorating judgment of the king, in its generosity, allows
this yellow-faced servant to keep a few of those gold coins, he will be
able to preserve his dignity among his compeers. If the object of the
king be diamonds and pearls, I have collected so many of them that
neither the eyes of the rocks have beheld nor the ears of the fish heard
of a similar treasure. Of horses, too, I possess twenty thousands, both
babri and kohi,? the former of which would fly like the wind on the
sea without wetting their feet, and the latter would make the mountain
ridges tremble like the Indian sword with their tread. The reins of all
these horses will be tied to the royal stable. Elephants also have I,
hundreds of them, which I would gladly send to the sublime thresh-
old. They are the elephants of Ma‘bar, not the grass-eating ones, and
all young and new-born who are now just growing their tusks not like
those whose tusks have become raised up with age or who have become
toothless. These elephants have heard the elephant-prostrating noise
of the royal forces, and with their ears wide open they draw lines on the
ground with their trunks,’ in humility and repentance, saying that
hence-forward they would not turn their faces towards the Ka‘ba of
Islam except in slavish deference..... In short this slave, Luddar Deo,
places in one scale of the balance all the wealth, elephants and horses
he possesses, and in the other his own life, and the king can choose either
of them, may Iqbal‘ of China with his chiefs be tied to the chains of
his elephants ! ’

This message was delivered to Kafir by the rajah’s ‘ basiths’® or
messengers in eloquent Hindi ‘ more cutting than the sword’, and next
day the rich presents consisting of elephants, precious stones, like

emeralds, rubies, ‘rumminis’,) cat’s-eyes and cock’s-eyes? amd dia-
monds, pearls and horses were brought to the royal camp. The malik,
satisfied that the rajah could pay no more, accepted the presents, and
returned to Delhi arriving there on Muharram 710 H., where he was
received by the king in great state.

It was during the early stages of this expedition that Rajah Karn’s *
‘daughter, the beautiful Devaldi, was captured, chiefly by the help of
Alp Khan, the governor of Gujarat. She was brought in Delhi to her
fond mother, Kanwladi, and soon a great romance sprung up between
the Rajput princess and Khidr Khan, which Khusrau has described at
length in his ‘Ashiqa. Khidr Khan was married by his mother to her
brother Alp Khin’s daughter, but the young prince who was madly in
love with Devaldi at last succeeded in persuading his mother to consent
‘to his marriage with her.

In Juméd IT, 710 g., another large army was sent for the conquest
of Ma‘bar. Malik Kafir, who had risen greatly in ‘Alauddin’s favour
since his victory in the south, was again in command, and after a grand
muster lasting for fourteen days, held on the ford of the Jumna, he
started with swift marches, reaching Kaithin‘ after twenty-one days.
‘They arrived in Gurgano ® after another seventeen days, having crossed
-on their way lofty hills where huge horses looked like ants creeping on
the hillside and elephants like particles of dust in the sun-lit crevice of a
house, and waded through many streams. Here they halted for some
days and received twenty-three elephants sent by the rajah of Tilang.
After crossing the Tawi (Tapti), they arrived at Deogir ®° which had been

8 The rajah after the conquest of his kingdom by ‘Alauddin’s generals, had
‘found a shelter with Ramdeo of Deogir. His name is indifferently given as Kiran
or Karan, etc. but the Sanskrit form is Karna and Khusrau has the correct form
‘in his works. He says in the ‘Ashiga (p. 95) :

decorated in honour of the royal army. ‘They saw a city more fresh
and pleasant than the paradise of Shaddid. Every street was a garden
where the money-changers sat with heaps of small and large ‘“‘ Achiis’’?
and gold and silver ‘“‘tankahs’’. Clothes of every kind, unprocurable
anywhere from Bihar in India to Khorasan, lay in bundles in shops,
like tulips on the hills or hyacinths in the garden. Fruits of the best
kind, fresh and luscious, were piled high and every kind of equipments
required by the soldiers, cotton, woollen and leathern cloths, as well as.
brass and steel armour, were kept ready.’ The rajah had moreover
instructed his ‘ dalawi’ or commander, to help in the advance of the
royal army. The Dalawi? held a place very distant from Deogir, so.
that ‘from Deogir, the city of security, to the town of devastation
(Bandari), held by Pars Ram, the Dalawi’,® the army had to make
five halts and to cross three big rivers, Sini, Godavari and Pehnur.* At
Bandari they heard that the two brothers, Bir Pandaya and Sundar
Pandaya, had fallen out, and while the former had gone away to chastise
his younger brother, Ballil Deo of Dhursamundar® had attacked and
captured two cities belonging to him, but hearing of the approach of
the royal army had retired to his dominions.

Kafiir reached before the fortress of Dhursamandar on Thursday,
the fifth of Shawwal. The rajah, Ballil Deo, wanted to make peace
with the khan, but his ministers urged him to fight. ‘If we have to.
die, let us not die disgraced ’, they said. But the rajah replied : ‘ Our
great priests of yore have thus declared that the Hindus cannot stand
before the Turks as fire cannot resist water’. He sent messengers and
wanted to secure peace on terms similar to those accepted by Luddar
Deo and Ramdeo. But Kafir offered him the three alternatives of
Islam, tribute (dhimma) or death, whereupon the rajah sent the folowing
reply : ‘ All the wealth and goods that this slave Ballil possesses, are
at the service of the sky-sheltering threshold and so is the slave Ballal

8 Elliot has been misled by the epithet ‘ Kharaébabad’, used by Khusrau for:
Bandari as opposed to Aimanabad (not Im&nabad) used for Deogir, and considers
it to be a proper name. This has led Aiyangar to make wild conjectures about
the identity and position of Kharaébabad, an imaginary city. (See pages 102 and
198 of his book.)

shall present all I have to the Islamic faith keeping not a single thread
with myself except the zone which is the indispensable emblem of my
broken Hindu religion.’

The malik at last accepted the presents offered by the rajah. They
were brought to the royal camp by several ‘ basiths’! and consisted of
huge, ‘demon-like’ elephants and horses of various kinds,? and next
day the rajah himself coming out of the fortress paid homage to the
royal canopy.

Kafir stayed at Dhursamundar for twelve days, sent the elephants
to Delhi and then proceeded towards Ma‘bar.

Between Dhursamundar and Ma‘bar they crossed a mountain
‘whose top touched the clouds and was bare of all vegetation’, and
where they found two passes in two ‘ ghatis’,? Talmali and Tabar.‘
They then came to a river and encamped in a desert, and commenced
‘wiping away the dirt of unbelief from that begrimed country with the
water of their swords ’, and despoiled a place called Mardi.

In the month of Dhulqa‘da, Kafir started from the river Kantri
in the direction of Bir Dhil. The Rai was filled with consternation and
thought of fleeing to the sea and taking shelter in an island, but finding
that unpracticable, he prepared himself for resistance. ‘ All the Hindus
donned the armour and ate the tanbil, but they ate it only to make
ready for a flight, for as they chewed the leaves they saw their mouths
bleed in grief for them..... The Bir also, in accord with them, chewed
the leaf and swallowed blood.’ On the approach of the royal army
he fled to the city of Kim ® and, taking some provisions and treasures,

1 Khusrau gives their names as Balakdeo Nayik, Nayan (Narayan) deo and
Jitmal (fol. 67b). Cf. also Elliot, iii, 89.

2 These were ‘ Bahris, who, while swimming, considered the sea a pool of water ;
zaghchashms (crow-eyed); siyahs (blacks) ; Nuqras (silver-greys) ; Abrashes (dappled
greys) and “ gulgiinén”’ which looked as if wind had been made rose-coloured...
Some of them were huge like elephants, but so swift and active that one thought
they could enter into an ant-hole.’

3 The manuscript has: Ge: :

4 Sic in the MS. Elliot (iii, 90) has Sarmalf and Tabar. (See also Aiyangar,
p. 103). Tabar is the pass now known as Toppur Pass. It is difficult to identify
Talmali or Saramali. It may be, as Aiyangar suspects, a corrupt form of Puramali.

5 Aiyangar (pp. 96-97) identifies Mardi with Madura. Khusrau says of it:
‘The impotent Hindus had named their town Mardi, while there was no man
(Mardi) in it at all, and they dreamed idle dreams fancying themselves to be very
courageous and brave’..... Wassat also has the same name.

Elliot omits this portion in his translation of the Khazain-ul-futth. I think
Amir Khusrau does not mean by Mardi the city of Madura, for later on we find
Mathra (fol. 79b) for Madura.

proceeded to Kandir.! ‘There also his feet could find no hold, and so
he betook himself to the forests where the elephants and tigers live.’
A number of Muhammadans in the rajah’s service came and joined
Kafir’s army. Bir Dhiil® was occupied and though the rains now set
in heavily, Kafar started in pursuit of the Rai. On the way to Kandur
he met and scattered a detachment of his army, and in Kandur 120
elephants with huge treasures fell into his hands. Then he proceeded
towards Jalkota, but finding no trace of the Rai, ‘who had fled to a
forest where even an ant could not creep on account of the thick vegeta-
tion ’, he returned to Kandur and busied himself in collecting elephants
and gold, and obtained 250 elephants.

He then plundered the Golden Temple ° ‘ as old as the blasphemy of
‘Azazil.¢ It was like a pillar of gold extending from the earth to the
sky, scratching the eyes of stars, and entering the orb of the sun.....
Its walls were so thickly studded with rubies and emeralds of sun-like
brilliance that the onlooker saw red and yellow and the eyes were
jaundiced at the sight of gold. The green emeralds, one would fancy,
were like a parrot flown out of the moon’s egg, and the bejewelled body
of the idol looked as if there were swellings on the sun..... > All
this wealth was plundered, the ‘ lingas’ were destroyed and the priests
slain, and Kafir then proceeded to the city of Kim. In five days more
he reached Mathra (Madura), which was the capital of Sundar Pandaya,
the brother of the Rai (Vira Pandaya). They found the city empty.

1 Identified by Aiyangar with Kannanur (Khandanpuram). Vide pp. 110-111.

2A curious name. It is certainly the name of a place other than Dhur
Samundar, for Khusrau says: ‘The rai was Bir and the city also Bir’ (fol. 71
wn” ess JI ut") and in the passage plays upon the words Dhul (which means
dust in Hindi) and Duhul (a drum). Aiyangar is inclined to identifying it with
Vira Solan or Gangaikondasolapuram which he describes to be the capital of Vira
Pandaya. But according to Khusrau his capital was Fatan (Pattanam).
See p. 165.

8 Aiyangar (pp. 108-109) identifies the temple with Chidambaram, one of
whose popular names was Ponnambalam or Golden Hall. Khusrau gives the name
as Marhatpuri (Elliot-Brahmastpuri) which, as Aiyangar surmises, may be a dis-
torted form of Brahmapuri, the sacerdotal name given to Chidambaram in the
Saiva literature. In the ‘Ashiqa Khusrau says of Bir (Vira) Pandaya :

—

and then describes the idol.

The rajah had fled with his ranis, leaving only two or three elephants
in the temple of Jagnar.1 Kafir, infuriated, set fire to the temple.

With the immense booty, the malik now started back. The line
of the captured elephants stretched three farsangs long, there were
numerous horses and five hundred mans of gems and gold. The return
march was commenced on the 4th of Dhulhijja and Delhi was reached
on the 4th of Jumad II, 711 #. The King received Kafir in a magnifi-
cent Durbar specially held for the occasion. The rich spoils were
presented before the staring eyes of the courtiers and the victorious
generals were generously rewarded. Never before had such treasures
been brought to Delhi, and ‘Alauddin for once again was as generous
as he had been when he marched from Karra to the capital. The nobles
and maliks each received four, two, one or a half ‘man’ of gold, and
there was general rejoicing all over the country.

According to Badaoni, Amir Khusrau was also with the malik in
this last great expedition of ‘Aléuddin’s reign. Khusrau himself
does not say that, and it seems unlikely that the poet should have
accompanied the army on its long and arduous journey, when the king
with his court was in Delhi. He was now already a comparatively old
man, and since he became a disciple of Nizémuddin Auliya he tried
as far as possible to shun the company of nobles and soldiers and to
devote himself to piety and prayer. His detailed account of the
campaign would, no doubt, suggest that the poet possessed first-hand
information about it,—that he was an actual witness of the spectacular
drama that unfolded itself in the far-off lands of the south. But we
must remember that Khusrau wrote his Khazdin-ul-futih as a court
historian and must have based his narrative on authentic official records
so that he could mention all the details of the battles without being
through the fray himself.

U’ ‘Alduddin’s long reign of twenty years that was now drawing to a
close had been the most productive period of Khusrau’s life. He com-
pleted his third diwan? and wrote the well-known Khamsa during this
period and attained that perfection and maturity in poetry, which
age alone can impart it. His fame, as he says, had spread from city to
city and like the sun had seized the East and the West.2 But whether
the poet was very happy and prosperous as well is doubtful. He speaks
of ‘Aljuddin’s reign as one of general prosperity, peace and security.

‘Wonderful peace and security ’, he writes,’ ‘for from the ramparts of
Delhi to the compounds of Khorasan a carpet of red satin has been
spread with the blood of the ruddy-visaged Chinese so that all turbulence
is dormant and all disorder and tumult extinct and the mischief-mongers
are fallen..... On one side the mountain-like armies of the Chengiz-
Khanis have been blown off beyond the Oxus by the furious blast of
his might, and on the other side the powerful rais of India, who with
their numerous elephants used to trample the ranks of the Turks, have
not only been compelled to give elephants and treasures, but some of
them who were still truculent have been so crushed that their heads
were thrown like oil-cans under elephants’ feet and with the oil of those
cans”? the roughness of the elephants’ feet was smoothed out. In
matters of justice and the welfare of his subjects, he has devised such
laws as could not be imaged in the mirror of Alexander or beheld in the
Cup of Jamshid. With his balanced judgment he has laid down such a
principle for cheapening grain, which is the leaven of life’s substance,
that if for years the wandering clouds do not pour down the sweat of
their brow, the wind does not move its fan, the ruddy soil does not
grow any green herbage and the hot sun does not ripen the crops, he
can keep the multitude supplied with food from his royal granaries.
Other requirements of the people, too, even if they be “red sulphur ’’®
or white rubies,‘ he has rendered cheaper and more easily accessible
than yellow amber or red grain. Moreover, money, which is the elixir
of desires and the most cherished of objects, has become so cheap on
account of his heavy gifts and abundant charities that no one feels the
strain of the high price of a stuff, so that prosperity and comfort prevail
all over his dominions..... Robbers flee away from the shadow of
wealth as shadow flees from the sun and justice is busy in uprooting
tyranny as a lamp roots out darkness. The mighty elephant has not
the courage to tread haughtily in the path of a feeble ant and the hungry
tiger has not the cheek to laugh at the unsteady gait of a lame deer.’ 5
Barni is rather inconsistent about this point and makes apparently
contradictory statements concerning the general economic conditions of .

the time. While recounting, for instance, the ‘ wonders’ of ‘Alauddin’s
reign, he says: ‘ The first wonderful thing was the cheapness of grains,
clothes and other requisites of livelihood, whose prices never varied in
spite of droughts and famines, and as long as ‘Alauddin was alive this
cheapness remained undisturbed’! But while speaking of the reign
of Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah he asserts: ‘ After a long time tankahs
and jitals poured into purses and bags..... People got rid of the ill-
temper, severity and multifarious exactions of Sultan ‘Alauddin. Gold
and silver appeared in and outside the houses, streets and quarters of
the city.’* ‘Alaéuddin certainly seems to have exercised a good deal of
discretion in how he spent his money. Even Khusrau says: ‘Th

characteristics of his sublime nature were all in accord with the laws of
moderation. His anger was like the fire that cooks, not that which
burns ; his mercy like the wind that blows freely but raises no dust ;
his temper like the water that pleases but drowns not, and his generosity
like the mine that treasures wealth but does not destroy it.’® Having
once consolidated his position by an almost fantastically generous dis-
tribution of gold, he took care not to squander his treasury in lavish
gifts. His officers got no fabulous remunerations‘ and the traders
could not hoard money by profiteering. His control over the financial
resources of the country was as strict as it was complete, and although
a few suffered the majority of his subjects seem to have been better off
than they had been in the time of his predecessors.

“ He was almost illiterate and consequently had little regard for
learning and scholarship, and did not patronize the literary men of his
time as generously as Kaiqobad or Firiiz Khalji had done. Yet his
reign could boast of a greater number of poets, scholars and saints than
that found in the reign of any other king of Delhi. ‘The most wonderful
thing’, says Barni, ‘which people beheld in his reign was the throng of
great men of all nationalities, masters of every science and experts in
every art. (Che capital of Delhi, by the presence of these peerless men
of extraordinary talents, had become the envy of Baghdad, the rival
of Cairo and the equal of Constantinople.’® ‘A city like Delbi!’ says
Khusrau, ‘ hills around it and a river in its midst! Every stone in it
which you turn will disclose a pearl of poesy and from every yard of

earth that you dig a fountain of ideas will spring forth.’? Khusrau and
Hasan, of course, were the chief poets of the time and ‘Aliuddin seems
to have confirmed Khusrau in the office of ‘ mushafdar’ 2 conferred
upon him by Firiz Khalji.

According to Barni, ‘Alauddin did not add anything to the annuity
of one thousand tankahs that Khusrau used to receive before his reign.®
But it is apparent from Khusrau’s poems that the king’s favours to the
poet were frequent and abundant, and that he had given him a village
in reward for a poem.

Khusrau had, however, to make a hard struggle before he could
persuade the stern and astute monarch to loosen his purse strings. In
a poem which he wrote in the fourth year of ‘Alaéuddin’s reign he says
addressing him : ‘ The year when the Shadow of God ascended the throne,
the first honour that my fortune bestowed on me was my admission to
the royal court, where I used to stand before the king in the proper

give him this office : ‘O King of Kings! to whom the sky turned and said: ‘‘I am
a slave, grateful to the universal bounty of the King’’, what I desire from thee
is the office of ‘‘mushafdarf”’ so that the amulet of my prayers may become the
armour for his royal body.....

place of my service. One day as with a charming ode I sprinkled the
royal carpet with sugar, the King of the World was pleased to command
me to sit in the court. The Khan-i-Khanan! was very kind to me on
hearing that letter of victory and gave me a special robe of honour and
five hundred silver tankahs, and the memory of that, gift is still fresh in
my mind. May God light the soul of the great Khan with the torch
of His forgiveness, and may the King live beyond all reckoning of time
to occupy the throne of happiness! I, an humble admirer of the King,
may also get what I want. O King! I know that there never was a
wiser king for you are a thorough connoisseur of skill, a good critic of
verses and a friend of poetry. But alas! I have fallen on such unlucky
times that I can hardly get a decent living. If I do not prosper in your
time, how can I ever do so after you? How sad that there be a king
like you and a poet like me be stricken with want! The allowance which
I get from your Majesty is my right* and the reward of my service
for I remain always beside the royal stirrup..... But as I want to praise
you, how can I write verses without some reward ? You cannot possibly
be unaware of the generosity shown to poets by other kings, who gave
away often a treasure for an ode. Khaqini, in reward for one ode, got
a thousand dinars for each verse and the poet Mu‘izzi® sat on a gold
chair in Merv. When Firdausi wrote his Shihnamah, the king gave him
an elephant-load of gold, and yet his miserliness has become a tale.
‘Unsuri also got endless favours from Sultan Mahmiid so that all his
furniture was of gold. That patronage which the kings showed to the
poets has left behind everlasting panegyrics and an eternal fame of their
generosity. We know when they lived and what patronage they re-
ceived from the kings: but to-morrow when we are dead and gone,
what would people tell about us? O King of the World, for this reason,
charity to poets is imperative! If the wizards of those days were
peerless in their age, I also, in my age, am not less than they were—if
not more—and although my name is not ‘Unsuri my poetry is in no
way inferior to his. He quafied the cup of gold by his skill in poetry :

patronage aids me I can transcend him in poetry, for grass grows only

disease of ‘expectation, reward me in proportion to the excellence of my
poetry! To-day there is many a slave around you busy day and night
in your service and one of the humblest am I. When a hundred years
. have passed from now, the world will be another world, and the people
who will read the praises of the king will know the worth of my service.
You shall remain while I shall be no more: I shall be gone but my
service shall endure..... One day your Majesty was pleased to be kind
to your slave, and you said to me: ‘‘O admirer of our kingdom, be
happy that you have been exalted by our rule and have been favoured
by us. We shall give you so many treasures that you shall be free from
all concern and care.” With that fair promise, this humble slave has
been content till now. Four years have elapsed since—may your glory
last for a hundred years—and so I remind you of that promise, for
perchance you have forgotten it, although I know that a promise from
one like you cannot but be fulfilled. Through your grace hundreds of
your slaves have soared to the skies—let me be one of those slaves .’ ?

‘Alauddin, it would seem, insisted on the poet attending the court
regularly and discharging the duties that his office entailed upon him.
This was, however, not very agreeable to Khusrau, who had under the
previous patrons been allowed to live a life of comparative freedom and
ease, presenting himself only at the pleasant wine-parties where poets
and musicians gathered and sang. In another long poem addressed to
the king he says :

‘If day and night I attend not the court of your Majesty to perform
my humble services, it matters little, for when a hundred crowned heads
bow before you daily you can easily forgive the absence of a beggar. I
say that not because I know not how to serve, for I can be at your
service day and night, morning and evening : I can display the magic of
my poetry in the assembly and can play with the sword at the time of
battle, and even if arrows and spears rain from the moon? I would not
turn away from your august saddle-strap. But I have to string pearls
and to say subtle things with a fresh imagination. Now I turn to the

. flowing spring and now I betake myself to a green meadow, and before
I can find a pearl worthy of your ear all my blood has to boil like a river.

produce poetry ? Without thought surely my poetry will be but frivo-
lous and shallow.’ After stressing the importance of poetry and of
the service rendered to kings by poets, he mentions how the former
kings rewarded poets, how Riidagi got a ‘man’ of gold for every fine
verse and how Khaqani had screens of ‘aksiin’,’ carpets of satin,®
pearl-studded musical instruments and wine-flagons,? and Greek and
Chinese slaves that served him with gold plates and ruby dishes.‘ He
then says : ‘I have not cast my lot in poetry ® to secure favours from the
king, for I am not of those greedy persons who lose their honour in their
covetousness. Whether my reward be large or small, I am happy, and
shall be content even if it is neither small nor large. If by your grace
you lift me up, my poetry shall rise to the skies, but if you never think
of me—well what does a king care if a beggar dies. I am content with
my poverty and humble solitude : my trust is in God who will give me
my bread..... But it is a pity that the whole world is so happy and a
poet like me should starve thus.® I am like a bird who has just learnt
to sing and its tongue has been tied and its throat sewn up. The wealth
of poetry that I scatter about is certainly incommensurate with my
wages, and yet how many bright pearls still lie concealed in my mind.
Had I been born in Rayy or in Riim” even my thorny bushes would
have appeared like smooth wax trees, and every one hearing my poetry
would have been eager to see me saying to himself: My God! how does
that wizard look who has taken such trouble in producing this magical
poetry! But now even my flowers produce only vinegar,’ dark and un-
pleasant of smell. A pearl is precious for every finger cannot reach it,
while water that is the essence of life is cheap on account of its abundance.

and even if my service to you is not worthy of securing your patronage,
during the few months that I have passed in your presence I have laid
before you such treasures that Khidr will continue giving you the water
of immortality as long as the black colour of the letters remains. When
a poet wets the point of his pen he performs the service of two hundred
years in one moment. Do not think lightly of poets’ work, for each of
their sweet words spells a life. Of what value is the pure gold to you
when after your death it would no longer be of any service? You
should buy an eternal life with gold so that your renown may always
live..... a

Khusrau complains elsewhere also of this compulsion to attend the
court which, as he says, left him no time for attending to his art. In
a charaeteristically outspoken and frank passage at the conclusion of his
mathnawi Majniin-o-Leyla, he compares his lot to that of Nizimi who
had, he asserts, no other occupation except writing poctry. ‘ But
poor I’, he continues, ‘needy and confused, have always my brain
boiling like a cauldron. All night till day-break and from morn till
eve I find no respite from my worries: For the sake of my selfish spirit?
I have to stand on my feet before a man like myself. As long as my
blood mounts not from my foot to my head no one washes my hands
with his water. The wages which they give me they think to be a favour
and. all my labour is ignored, just as an ass, who carries loads of fodder
in a sad plight is given some oats with a bad grace.’

But if Khusrau suffered some slight inconvenience and hardship
during ‘Aléuddin’s reign, he could bear it more calmly and philosophically
and with greater patience and resignation for he had now entered upon
a new phase in his life. In the year 671 he became a disciple of the
famous saint of Delhi, Nizimuddin Auliya, whom he had known from
his early youth‘ and for whom he had always had a great regard, and
thus started his career as a full-fledged stifi. Mohammad ibn Ahmed
ibn ‘Ali al-Bukhari Nizimuddin Auliya, one of the most prominent.
and revered saints of the Chishtiya sect and known by the title of Sultan-

4 According to some biographers, Khusrau became a disciple of the Sheikh
when he was only eight years of age. This is not correct, but he knew the Sheikh
from an early age, as the latter had stayed for some time in the house of Rawat-
Arg, the grandfather of the poet. (Cf. Prof. Habib, p- 37.)

ul-Auliya (the Sultan of saints), was a native of Badaon where he was
born in the year 634 H. His grandfather Khwaja ‘Ali had migrated
from Bukhara’ to India where he first settled at Lahore and later at
Badaon, so that the Sheikh, like his favourite disciple, Khusrau, was of
Turkish origin. His father died when he was only five years old and
thenceforward he was left to the care of his mother Bibi Zuleykba, a
pious and virtuous lady from whom he imbibed his great love for things
spiritual. Mother and son soon after moved from Bada&on to Delhi and
settled down in poor lodgings beneath a mosque leading a life of great
indigence and hardship. Nizimuddin, however, did not neglect his
early studies and becoming a pupil of Shamsuddin Khwarizmi, a great
scholar of the day who was later appointed to the high post of a minister
by Balban,? he acquired considerable proficiency in esoteric and exoteric ®
sciences before the age of twelve. One of his neighbours was Najibuddin
al-Mutawakkil, the brother of Sheikh Fariduddin of Ajodhan* and
Nizimuddin often frequented his house. There came to al-Mutawakkil’s
house one day a qawwal, Abii Bakr by name, from Multan who had
visited on his way to Delhi the monastery of Sheikh Farid, and who
related all he had seen there. The young sifi listened with rapt attention
and was so impressed by the account of Khwaja Farid’s piety and
saintliness that he at once made up his mind to go to Ajodpan and
become a disciple of the saint. °

Nizimuddin remained with Khwaja Farid for several years and
served his master with great zeal and devotion, thereby winning his
special favour, so that when he had completed his training the master’
gave him a robe and a carpet with his blessings and sent him to Delhi.
Delhi, asthe capital of Hindustan, had become a haunt of men of all
classes and types and was not free of those vices and crimes which crop
up in big cities. Nizamuddin hesitated a long time before he finally
decided to scttle in that city. It was, he thought, noble to live the life

of a hermit and recluse away from the noise and bustle of cities—away
from temptation and vice, but it was nobler to live with the people and
for the people, to remain pure and unsullied in an atmosphere corrupt
with sin and to strive to lead the erring souls to truth and virtue by the
light of his own piety. He selected for his abode a spot some miles
from the city in a village called Ghiydthpir! and his master, Khwaja
Farid, before his death, appointed him his successor in preference to his
own sons.? Thé first few years of his career as a teacher and guide
passed in great poverty, but soon his fame spread far and near. In
the reign of ‘Alauddin his disciples numbered thousands, and_ his
monastery was always crowded with darweshes who found food and
shelter there. Barni, writing of this period, says: ‘The Sheikh-ul-
Islam, Nizémuddin, had opened wide the door of a universal disciple-
hood and bestowed robes and forgiveness on the sinners admitting them
to his tutelage. To the elite, as well as to the multitude, to the rich,
the poor, the nobles, the paupers, the scholarly, the ignorant, the gentle,
the rough, the citizens, the peasants, the warriors, the freemen and the
slaves, he gave the four-cornered cap, and the ‘ miswak ’ of purification
with his blessings..... All people, believing in him, tried to emulate
him in devotion and virtue. Men and women, young and old, low and
mean, servants and slaves, and even small boys had begun to offer
their prayers regularly.... Rich and benevolent persons had con-
structed in several pleasant spots between the city and Ghiyathpir
terraces with thatched roofs and had wells dug there. The terraces were
supplied with large jars full of water, clay jugs? and mats, and keepers
and reciters were posted there so that people coming from or going to
the monastery of the Sheikh may not be inconvenienced in making their
ablutions at prayer times. In each of these terraces one saw crowds
of people offering prayers. Perpetration or talk of crime had declined
among the people, and they talked mostly of religious things*.....
So far had the spirit of piety and devotion progressed that even in the
royal palace several nobles, silihdars, scribes, soldiers and slaves who
had become disciples of the Sheikh performed the ‘ chasht ’ and ‘ ishraq ’ 5

sprung up there. But ‘Alaéuddin again shifted his residence from Kiloghari to

2 A split, however, occurred, and while Nizaimuddin was in Delhi, Khwaja
Farid’s nephew, ‘Alauddin Sabir, founded a rival order (Sabiriya) at Piran Kalyar.

prayers and fasted on ‘ayyam-i-baid’! and the tenth of Muharram.
There was no quarter in the city where after twenty days or a month
there was no gathering of the pious listening to sufistic music and
weeping in ecstasy..... Sultan ‘Alaéuddin himself, with all his family,
had great faith in the Sheikh ? and the hearts of all classes of people were
inclined towards virtue and piety. Never did the name of wine and
women, crime and sin, gambling or other vile practices, profane the lips
of people during the latter portion of ‘Alaiuddin’s reign. Most of the
students, nobles and great men who attended upon the Sheikh were seen
to be busy in the study of books on sufism or the Islamic law. Books
like Ihya-ul-‘Ulim, its translation, ‘Awarif, Kashful-Mahjib, Quwwat-ul-
Qulib, the commentary of Ta‘arruf, Risa&la-i-Qushairi, Mirsid-ul-‘Ibad,
Maktiibat of ‘Ain-ul-Qudat, Lawayih and Lawami‘ of Qadi Hamiduddin
Nagauri, and the Fawaid-ul-Fuad of Amir Hasan found eager purchasers,
and people generally inquired at the booksellers’ for books on sufism
and divinity.2 No turban was seen without a ‘ miswik’”* or comb
hanging from it, and leather jugs and basins had become dear owing to
large numbers of stiifi buyers..... 5

Nizimuddin Auliya, a man of singular piety and learning, who
never married and never disgraced the mantle of Khwaja Qutb that had
descended on his shoulders after the death of Khwaja Farid, was not a
dry ascetic. His days passed in fasting, prayers, and teaching and his
nights in long vigils with only brief snatches of sleep. When his dis-
ciples met him in the morning they found his face lit up with a strange
ecstatic glow and his eyes tinged with a soft pink, so that Khusrau is
once said to have addressed him with the following well-known verse :
‘You look sleepless and tired, in whose embrace did you pass the night,
for your drowsy eyes have still traces of tipsiness ?’® Yet he was of a
pleasant and genial nature, loved to meet and talk with people of all

classes, possessed a refined taste for poetry 1 and was extremely fond of
music. On the fifth of Muharram annually the ‘urs of Khwaja Farid
was celebrated at his monastery and people came from far and near to
listen to the songs of the skilled qawwals that enlivened the assembly.
His disciples danced in rapture on hearing the ghazals_o usrau
Hasan. and Sa‘di that were recited to the accompaniment of drums or
timbrels.2 Such a man could not but appreciate the talents of the
poet, and so it was with real affection and genuine pleasure that the
saint received Khusrau when he called upon him to enrol himself in the
growing throng of his disciples. ‘A Turk has come to see us,’ he said
to his servant, ‘show him in’. ‘Welcome and greetings!’ he said to
Khusrau as the latter entered, and showed him great favour bestowing
upon him a ‘ bairani’ (upper coat ?) and a four-cornered cap.*

The sain soon cenceived a strong liking for Khusrau. He gave
him the title of Turkullah and is said to have remarked ¢ ‘I hope on the
Day of Judgment to be expunged of all blame by the fire that burns in
the heart of this Turk’.* Great attachment grew up between master
and pupil and Khusrau was one of the most regular attendants at the
monastery.’ Other disciples sought Khusrau’s aid to obtain favours
from the saint, and Khusrau was always ready to hetp them./ He was
still a courtier and so formed a link between the king, princes, and nobles
on one side and his pious master in his retreat at Ghiyathpir on the
other, narrating to the Sheikb all the latest developments at the court,
for although he never meddled in political affairs, Nizimuddin could
not but have a keen interest in them. Many of the nobles were his dis-
ciples, and Khidr Khan himself had entered their ranks.’ The king, too,

in spite of all his scepticism and want of interest in things religious or
spiritual, had great esteem for him and sought his moral aid in times of
political and military stress.

Many stories are told about Khusrau and his master. It is said
that the poet saw Khidr in a dream and asked him for a drop of his
saliva that could impart wonderful sweetness and eloquence to his
poetry and warrant him an eternal fame. ‘ That gift,’ replied Khidr,
“TI have already bestowed on Sa‘di’. The poet much dejected went to
his teacher and related the occurrence, whereupon the saint dropped
into his mouth his own saliva which turned out to be as efficacious and
potent as that of the old man, Khidr. According to another and a more
acceptable version, the saint took out from under his bedstead a dish full
of sweets and scattered it over the poet’s head, so that a sweetness,
strange and supernatural, crept into his poetry. *

Be it as it may, the fact is that, although the poet had achieved the
highest perfection in his poetry long before he became a disciple of the
saint, his association with him gave it a new strength and vigour, imparted
to it that fire and glow which are almost divine and which bring a poet
very close to the level of a prophet. Henceforth his heart was set on
things beyond sordid worldly igtrigues and ambitions, and, although
he still continued to sing the praises of princes, all his serious thoughts
dwelt in the realm of spiritual bliss and ecstasy. ‘Happy the hour,’
he sings, ‘when with a firm belief I grasped the hand of that hand-
grasper, for the hand of that ‘king’ becoming a boat laid open to me
the nine oceans (of gnosticism). From him I found the saliva that
has given such a lustre and freshness to my poetry.2, Even Khidr seeks
the sweet water that I have got from him and that keeps me alive.
If I pour two drops of this‘ water into my ink-pot, they will be like the
water of life in the dark well, and when one of those drops I take out
with my pen I would make a river flow abroad. These verses are like

1 See Firishta, V, 2, p. 391 seq. Qarabeg, the great favourite of ‘Alauddin,
who was a disciple of the saint, was once asked by ‘Alauddin to take to the Sheikh
two lacs of tangahs from him. When Malik Kafir was on an expedition in Deccan,
‘Alauddin received no news from him for a long time and sent Qarabeg and Qadi
Mughithuddin to Nizaémuddin Auliya requesting him to use his spiritual powers in
lifting the veil that hung upon the fate of the Islamic army. See Barni, p. 330.

2 It is probably this verse (ab eel 6 55 S el. mol ss 3) )
that has given birth to the story narrated above. Khusrau, of course, is speak-
ing metaphorically here. The verses occur in Nuh Sipihr (Introduction in
praise of Nizémuddin Auliya, beg. :

Kor DT eed Gt as ee slicel 5 yw & pal pe

oceans, yet they cannot circumvent the virtues of my teacher, and I.
can scarcely raise my head for shame at offering to him only what I
have got from him’.!

Nothing can exceed the poet’s enthusiasm and admiration for his
‘pir’. All his works, since the time he became his disciple, are pre-
ceded by his praises,” with usual exaggerations : ‘ The noble and exalted
Sheikh ’, he says, ‘to whose far-reaching sight the treasures of the
two worlds are but like an atom as compared with the precious treasure
of ‘faqr’! He who becomes his disciple is dragged out of the mire of
self as a cup is drawn from the wine (pitcher). He whose tongue is
trained by him, has a sword that splits open the pen of fate, and every
sick person for whom he prays is spared affectionately by death....
The world that is a hell full of fire is like the knife of Ishmael for his
disciples ’.8 :

The saint, too, on his side had the highest regard for the great
poet who in spite of his constant association with nobles and princes
was at heart as pure and virtuous a darwesh as any of his other disciples.
Khusrau’s ready humour, his lively nature and his versatile genius made
him a pleasant companion. ‘ I get tired of every one’, the saint once
said to Khusrau, ‘ but I never get tired of you’.*| He once composed
the following quatrain in admiration of his pupil :

‘Khusrau, like whom few men have written poetry or prose, is
certainly the king of poesy’s realm. He is our Khusrau, not Nasir
Khusrau, and God himself is the helper of our Khusrau.’®

When Khusrau presented to the Sheikh part of the MS. of his work
Afdal-ul-Fawaid,® the Sheikh took the leaves in his hands and studied
them, saying frequently: ‘You have written well and have named

well.’ He corrected the manuscript here and there and then turning to
those around him he said: ‘It is really creditable for Khusrau to write
down so many observations for he is always plunged from head to foot
in the ocean of ideas. But God has leavened all the organs of Khusrau’s
body with wisdom and learning for he swims all day long in the sea of
ideas and brings out a hundred thousand pearls.’ * Whereupon,’ says
Khuérau, ‘I rose from my place and bowed to the ground, saying :
“ All these ideas which come to my mind are due to the blessing of your
grace and power, for you train me with your auspicious guidance. God
be praised for that”. The Khwaja then gave me his special robe and
cap ’.)

The Sheikh’s kindness and affection were a source of great strength
for the poet in his old age, and helped him to bear with patience the
sorrows and bereavements that often beset the declining years of man,
and of which Khusrau had his full share. In 698 u. he lost his beloved
mother and his younger brother, Qutlugh, in the short space of a week
and was almost overwhelmed by his grief. The love of his mother and
her affectionate solicitude for her son were as great as those of her son
for her. She had been all in all to Khusrau ever since he was left an
orphan of seven by his father and her motherly advice was always
sought and obeyed by him. In the touching verses, at the close of his
poem, Majniin-o-Leyli, he says: ‘Thou hast gone and strength har
left my body; I succumb for the support is gone.... When thy lips
could talk, thy advice led me to my welfare ; but to-day the bond of
love is sundered—and yet thy silence guides me, for if 1 pay heed and
remain sensible I can still hear thy voice ’.?

Meanwhile his patron, ‘Alauddin, the ‘second Alexandar’ was
also fast approaching his end. He contracted a disease * that confined
him to his bed. Misfortunes seemed to have conspired to make his
last days bitter. His sons became truculent and refractory, and his
wives were always busy in arranging marriages of his numerous progeny
and giving big feasts, while the king lay ignored and forgotten. Alp
Khan, his brother-in-law, the governor of Gujarat, and Malik Kafir
were hatching their own designs and plans and nobody seemed to have

any sympathy for him.) The rivalry between Alp Khan and Kafar
ended in the murder of the former and the exile of Khidr Khan to
Amroha that in their turn led to a terrible rising in Gujarat. Khidr Khan
had vowed to visit the tombs of various saints if his father recovered
and hearing. of an improvement in his condition he started on his pilgrim-
age and at the end of it came to Delhi without the king’s permission.”

Kafar at once took advantage of this act of insubordinatidén to
secure an order from the king disinheriting Khidr Khan in favour of a
younger son, Shihabuddin, and exiling him to the fortress of Gwaliyar.
‘God be exalted!’ says Khusrau, ‘I know not what his (‘Alauddin’s)
heart was like, that such a pearl was to him but as dust. Such an ocean-
like drop that had trickled from him, hp cast away like a drop of sweat
from the brow. His patience was so wonderful that he did not lose
heart as his life departed. His beloved son was disappearing from his
eye, but he kept his tears back.’® ‘Aldiuddin died soon after. His end
was hastened prpbably by poison administered to him by Malik Kafir,®
who now became the virtual ruler of the vast kingdom of ‘Alaéuddin
having constituted himself the guardian of the infant prince, Shihabuddin.

Almost the first act of Kafir after ‘Alauddin’s death was his brutal
treatment of Khidr Khan.

He had bound himself by the most sacred oaths before his master
not to harm the disinherited and unfortunate prince ® but hardly had
the king’s coffin been lowered into the grave when he threw all promises
to the wind? and despatched a slave, § Sunbul by ni name, to ) Gwalliyar with

% Khusrau describes all these events in his Khidr Khan-o-Dewalrani.
According to him, Khidr Khan suffered these misfortunes for slighting his pir
Nizémuddin Auliya. He went to visit a sanctuary in Hastnapur, but did not visit
his monastery. He had, morcover, he adds, erred from the path of virtue and
had becomo pleasuro-loving and profligate, so that thousands of tempting beauties
accompanied him even on his pilgrimage. (See 1.0. MS., 1187; fol. 670 seq.).

instructions to blind Khidr Khan. This was accomplished and Khidr
Khan was thus rendered incapable of any ambitious designs on the
throne of his father. Shadi Khan and Farid Khan, two other sons of
the late king, were also blinded and the mother of Khidr Khan was
robbed of all her possessions and confined in a solitary dwelling.

Mubarak Khan, another prince, alone had escaped the terrible
needle and to him also Kafiir-now turned his attention. But luckily
before he could harm him he was himself killed by some of his most
trusted servants who overpowered him in his bedroom in the palace of
Hazar-Sutiin } where he had enjoyed a short sway of about a month.
‘ People watched from a distance ’, says Khusrau, ‘ the spring of sedition ®
for they beheld eunuchs like Kafiir and Sunbul holding court ..... but
the prayers of the afflicted have an effect. The world made out of the
sighs of the oppressed a sword and flung his ominous head off his in-
auspicious shoulders.’ $

Mubarak Khan, a youth of twenty, now occupied the throne of
Delhi with the title of Qutbuddin. He was proclaimed king on the
24th of Muharram, 716 H. amid universal rejoicing.* People welcomed
him with great enthusiasm after the stern rule of ‘Alauddin and the cruel
actions of his Barbek, Malik Kafar. Once more they beheld a youthful,
generous and pleasant monarch like Kaiqobad on the throne, and strove
to compensate for the long years of forced abstinence and piety. ‘ Hand-
some, young musicians flocked to the city. The price of a young slave
or a beautiful slave-girl reached as high as 500, 1,000 or even 2,000
tankahs, and although Qutbuddin kept in force ‘Alauddin’s decree of
prohibition, every house was converted into a tavern on account of
lack of vigilance and absence of fear, and wine began to be brought to
the city from villages under a hundred pretexts and guises.’ ©

The new king, however, began his career with an ambitious campaign
in the Deccan. Full of youthful vigour ‘he wanted now to betake
himself to Ghaznin and to place his spear among the enemies of Islam—
to render the world as narrow as the crease of a cloak for the Chinese of
Cathay, and now he wished that, in accord with the desires of his friends,
he should destroy the rais of Hindustan—should surprise the masters

somewhat errant) Khidr Khan was.

of elephants and capture a thousand clouds with a drop’. He con-
sequently marched out from the capital with a large army and, halting
for some time at Talpat, arrived in Deogir, which city assumed since
then, though only for a short period, the name of Qutbabad.?

Raghi, the naib of Ramdeo,* was the only Hindu chieftain who
offered resistance to the royal army. He retreated to the hills but was
hunted out and forced to fight. A large number of his followers were
killed, but Raghii escaped and concealed himself in an inaccessible cave.

The king then sent Khusrau Khan, a Hindu convert of a low caste,‘
who, like Malik Kafir of old, had won the royal favour more by his
beauty and charm than by conspicuous ability, against the country of
Tilang. Rudra Deva (Laddar Deo) had apparently thrown off the
yoke placed on his shoulders by Kafair and when the Khan approached
Arangal he prepared to meet him. He had five thousand horsemen and
an infantry ‘more numerous than the thorns of the desert’. The
musicians in the fortress sang war-like songs and the Brahmins prayed.
‘ But’, says Khusrau, ‘ although the Hindus can fight bravely against
one another, they cannot fight the Turks, just as two cocks can fight a
grim and angry duel but scurry away at the approach of a falcon.....
In fact it has been the tradition since oldest times in the world that the
Hindus should always fall a prey to the Turks ’.®

After preliminary skirmishes in one of which Qutlugh, Ghazi Kamil
and Timur, the governor of Chanderi, routed Kunda, a powerful warrior
and killed Devra Mehta with many a séwant and rina, the royal army
drove in the Hindus to the inner rampart and set fire to one of its gates,

1 Nuh Sipihr (1.0. MS., fol. 15 seq.). The clouds are elephants and the drop of
water the point of the lance or spear.

2 No historian, strangely enough, has noticed this name.’ But Khusrau says
clearly in his ode in praise of Deogir written in the reign of Mubarak Shah (Nihayat-
ul-Kamal : B.M. MS., No. 25,807, fol. 459b seq.).

See also Thomas’ Chronicles of the Pathan Kings (pp. 179 and 180) where a gold
coin of Mub&rak Shah’s reign is described. The coin struck in 718 bears the legend

¢! ae 3 OMT Clad Aki, ISU oe G,». Thomas supposes Qutbabad to be some part

of the city of Delhi, but it is certain that the coin was struck at Deogir, then called
Qutbabad, which was a place of mintage in the time of Qutbuddin’s predecessors as
well as his successors.

3 The narrative has Rai Ram, but the poet evidently means Raémdeo of Deogir
who was now dead. The ndib or minister is said to have had high ambitions of
driving out the Mohammadans from the south and establishing a Hindu raj.

and ‘the fire-worshippers of Rudra began killing their god on every
side ’.?

Laddardeo was soon closely besieged and the kban had made all
arrangements for storming the fortress, when he sent some messengers
with rich presents asking for peace. The presents included pearls, large
quantities of pure gold, Hindui silk cloth so fine that ‘a hundred yards
of it could easily be contained in the eye, and through which oil and
water as well as war-like missiles could not pierce’? elephants and
horses. The khan accepted the presents and the rajah, having agreed
to pay an annual tribute of twenty lakh achuas of gold, a hundred
elephants and a thousand horses with ten caskets of pearls and other rich
presents, and to cede the territory of Badrkot, a treaty of peace was
concluded.* The rajah signed it with the seal of Laddar Mahadeo®
and the khan gave him afresh the ‘ chatr ’ and other insignia of authority
bestowed upon him by ‘Alauddin. The khan now turned back and
joined the king, who had already left Deogir, half-way on the road to
Delhi. Great preparations were made in the capital for the reception
of the king. ‘Gold cloth was hung on the walls that glistened like the
rays of the sun, and the walls covered with red cloth looked like a boor
in a robe of sahibi.6 The ground was hidden beneath gold embroidered
velvet like a beautiful bride on the eve of her wedding, and was sprinkled
with the blood of sacrifices. On all sides men and women had crowded
to watch the procession and looked at the king’s face with a thousand
desires. The hearts of the people were happy at the sight of the royal

visage and they prayed and blessed.1 Many a marriage-bond was torn
on every side and many a record of crime was washed out.’ ®

Qutbuddin now completed the mosque which he had ordered to be
built before he started for Deogir. A pillar of red stone was raised in
the courtyard of the mosque. ‘ The surface of the stones was rendered
so bright that like a mirror one could see one’s face in them..... The
king could have made tho pillar of rubies but he did not want to feed
thieves, and if he had it studded with gold and silver it would have
become like the palace of Shaddad.3 Many a stone is better than pearls,
for it conceals and protects while pearls raise trouble. The fortress
was then built with baked bricks so closely joined that through their
crevices not only a hair, but imagination itself could not pierce without
being scratched. And when the building was ready all other cities
offered their tributes of praise to it. Delhi is the ‘ Dar-ul-Khilafah ”
and all countries are proud of it.’ ¢

Mubarak Shah had now little else to do. Peace prevailed in the
country. The veteran Ghazi Malik Tughlaq kept the Mongols at bay
in the north and the rajahs of the south were submissive. The youthful
king passed his time in revelry and jollity, drinking wine and listening
to music. Poets and musicians received huge rewards and Khusrau was
one of the earliest among the former to win royal favours. He was
invited to the court soon after the king’s return from Deogir. The king,
relates Khusrau, sat among his courtiers and was discussing the relative
merits of old and modern poets, and some praised Sandi while others
preferred Sa‘di. The king said that the advent of great poets like
Khaqini, ‘Unsuri and Firdausi was due to the generosity of kings, and
he continued : ‘ We are not less than they were in ambition... .. Have
we not sufficient wealth in our treasury? There never had been a king

1 Damidan, literally blowing, means blessing generally by the recitation of
some verses from the Koran.

The idea is that the king’s beauty sundered the marriage bonds, the women
all falling in love with him, while the king forgave criminals and liberated prisoners.
Cf. Miftahul-futih, where Khusrau says:

3 And so would have savoured of unholy pride. It is difficult to say which
particular mosque or pillar the poet is alluding to. Some historians seem to have
wrongly ascribed the building of the Qutb pillar to Qutbuddin on account of a
similarity in name. Khusrau evidently is referring to some other pillar.

. ¢ Khusrau repeatedly calls Qutbuddin, Khalifa in his Nuh Sipihr. He and

under the sky who could give a reward of ten or twenty lacs of tankahs ;
the first king to do that was he who was the glory of the world and the
faith’..... But if he gave hundreds to a slave, I give thousands and
yet I am not content with this. I aspire to give hundred times more
to those who ask for rewards, and to give an elephant’s weight of gold
from rich and countless treasures to the man who writes well the histo
of my reign. The way to this generosity was shown to me by my father
who used to give gold equal in weight to an elephant and they who are
wise know that that is heavier in weight than an elephant-load of gold
sees Since I have inherited this magnificent generosity, it does not
behove me to give less.’

Khusrau undertook the task. He was more than sixty now? and
had already served three kings. But his poetry was as vigorous as ever
and he soon completed the wonderful mathnawi, Nuh Sipihr,2 Whether
he actually got an elephant’s weight of gold in reward for it, is
uncertain,‘ but certainly his remuneration was generous, for he says,
addressing Qutbuddin,® ‘ The gift that I have got from a Jem like you,
I had rarely obtained from former kings, and the poetry, composed by
this old wizard of a poet, is also worthy of the gift. My former writings
hardly approach this special poem, for in it I have employed a new
method of description and on every page have poured an ocean (of
ideas).’

But the genial and pleasant monarch soon got into evil ways. He
became more and more profligate in his habits and at the same time
arrogantly proud and cruel. The helpless princes, Khidr Khan and
Shadi Khan, were cruelly murdered in the fortress of Gwaliyar after a
conspiracy formed by Asaduddin had been detected.® Even the de-
throned boy-king, Shihibuddin, was not spared, and Qutbuddin adopted

an attitude of open defiance and insult to the old Sheikh, Nizamuddin,
whom he suspected to be sympathetic towards Khidr Khan. Courtesans
and buffoons crowded his palace, and he often amused himself in very
original ways. He would dress himself in woman’s clothes and receive
his courtiers in that garb while wicked women mocked and abused
nobles like ‘Ain-ul-Mulk Multaéni, from the roof of the Hazar-sutin.
Buffoons, stark naked, walked into the midst of nobles and courtiers,
soiled their clothes and did other reprehensible and villainous things
while the king looked on and laughed.?

He never performed the prayers and broke the fast of Ramadan
openly. ‘He opened his tongue to revile Nizimuddin Auliya and was
overtly hostile to him. He prohibited his courtiers to visit Ghiyathpir
and would often say in fits of drunkenness: ‘I shall give a thousand
tankahs of gold to him who brings me the head of Nizimuddin”’. ‘ One
day when he met the Sheikb in the monastery of Sheikh Diyauddin
Rami on the day of his siyum,*® he paid no regard to the Sheikb’s sanctity
and position and did not return his greeting. In order to humiliate the
Sheikb he made Sheikhzida Jim, who was a rival of the Sheikh, his
great favourite and invited the Sheikb-i-Islam Ruknuddin from Multan
to Delhi.’® He did not stop here, but insisted that he, like other religious
heads, should visit his court at least once a month.* He fixed the last

her over to him. He is, however, silent as to her subsequent fate, though Firishta
says she was married to Mubarak after Khidr Khan’s death. Elliot, entirely mis-
reading the last portion of the ‘Ashiqa, concludes that she was killed with her
husband.

day of the month as the date on which the Sheikh must go to the palace
to pay him homage, threatening him with dire consequences if he did
not do so. There was great consternation among the disciples of the
Sheikb for he was determined to disregard the royal orders, and several
of them, including Amir Khusrau’s elder brother, ‘Izzuddin ‘Ali Shah,
tried hard to persuade him. But the Sheikb was as firm as ever and so
the worst was feared by all. Yet before the fatal hour could come '
Qutbuddin himself was brutally murdered by his favourite, Khusrau
Khan.

Khusrau Khan had been planning to compass the king’s death and
to occupy the throne ever since his expedition to the south. Several of
the nobles had warned the king of his evil designs, yet he was so infatuated
that he disbelieved them all and even punished them for telling, as he
thought, jealous lies against his favourite. His kindness to the Parwar
increased every day and Khusrau Khan managed to gather a large
number of his kinsmen around him who frequented the palace freely at
all hours, till one night they overpowered and killed the faithful tutor
of the king who had often remonstrated with the king about the
liberty and power granted to the Parwars.1 Khusrau Khan was with
the king who hearing the tumult asked him what had happened. ‘It is
only some horses got loose from the stable’, he assured him. But
soon his accomplices rushed, swords in hand, into the royal chamber.
The king, realizing the treachery too late, rushed towards the harem, but
Khusrau Khan, pursuing, caught him by his long hair, and in spite of all
the king’s efforts to free himself he held on, till the Parwars came and
severed the king’s head. The severed head was thrown down into the
lower court where it rolled amongst the feet of the scared royal guards,
who all took to flight. A terrible massacre ensued. Even women of
the royal household were murdered and insulted. Khusrau Kban at
once sent for all the important nobles and they were compelled to submit
to his authority and to acknowledge him king.

A reign of terror followed the murder of Qutbuddin.? Khusrau
Khan gave important offices, high positions and big titles to his Hindu
kinsmen who scoffed at Islam and used copies of the Koran as stools.

was entrusted with the keys of the palace.

unfortunate master, Qutbuddin, occupied the throne for four years and four months. :

seems to have been on very good terms with the profligate but lovable
monarch,’ kept aloof from the court during this period of turmoil, which,
however, did not last long.

Among the most notable and powerful nobles whom Khusrau Khan
kept almost like prisoners in Delhi were ‘Ain-ul-Mulk Multani and Jina
Kh4n, son of Malik Tughlaq, but one night Jina Khan, eluding the
vigilance of Khusrau Khan, fled away to Deopalpur and joined his
father, who at once made preparations to march on Delhi and to rid
her of the foul presence of Khusrau Khan. He was joined by a well-
equipped army from Multan under Malik Bahram, and, advancing
from Deopilpur, routed at Sarsuti an army, sent by Khusrau Khan
under the command of his brother, Khan-i-Khanin. Khusrau Khan
was now struck with panic, for the veteran malik advanced fast towards
the capital. He began to distribute gold right and left. All his soldiers
were given two or even three years’ pay in advance and large sums
were paid to all the holy personages, including Nizimuddin Auliya,
to pray for his success.2, But he could not elude Nemesis. He took
up his position outside the city near the ‘Aldi tank and awaited the
arrival of Tughlaq. ‘Ain-ul-Mulk Multani left him on the eve of the
battle which could have only one result, for it was impossible for Khusrau
Khan and his half-hearted, inexperienced companions to withstand the
onslaught of the malik whose whole life had passed in fighting the sturdy
Mongols and whose soldiers were all tried and faithful. In spite of the
gallant fight of Shaista Khan and Malik Taligha of Nagor ® and Khusrau
Khan’s own desperate and determined stand, the forces of Delhi were
soon defeated. Khusrau Khan, fleeing, took refuge in the tomb of his.
late patron and master, Malik Shadi, but was captured and put to death,
and thus on the first of Sha‘ban, 721 u., Malik Tughlaq entered Delhi as
the champion and avenger of the ‘Aldi family, and as no male member
of that doomed family was alive, all the nobles selected him as their

® Nizémuddin Auliya, like most of the other sheikhs, accepted the money,
but, as Barni says, they all prayed for the success of Islam, saying : ‘O God, help
him who helps the faith of Muhammad on whom be peace and blessing’. Their

prayers were thus really meant for the success of Malik Tughlaq.

king and master, and he ascended the throne of Delhi with the title of
Ghiyéthuddin amidst general applause and relief.

Khusrau greeted him enthusiastically. In an elegy on Mubarak
Shah written at that time he says: ‘The sun casts dust on its head
every night when it goes down in mourning for that bright sun who lies
beneath dust. If a dog has slain the lion do not be astonished for even
of old many a fierce lion has fallen a prey to a shamefaced dog. The
spirit of Sultan Qutbuddin, now in heaven, will have for its companions
Jesus and Gabriel! ..... The king Ghiyaéthuddin is a second Abi
Muslim,? who with the strokes of his sword has avenged the blood of
the second Haidar. He is the defender of Islam, Tughlaq Shah, whom
the sky has evolved after long years of astral revolutions.’ ®

Tughlaq Shah,‘ an extremely pious and. virtuous man, soon won
the hearts of all his subjects by his simplicity, sincerity and generosity,
and restored order and peace throughout the dominions disturbed by
the sad events at Delhi. He appointed his eldest son, Fakbruddin
Jina Khan, his heir and bestowed on him a canopy and the title of
Ulugh Khan. To his remaining four sons he gave the titles of Bahram
Khan,> Zafar Khan, Mahmid Khan and Nusrat Khan, and strove as
far as possible to compensate the members of the ‘Aldi family and their
dependants for the disaster that had befallen them.

‘Ulugh Khan led an expedition to Deogir in 722 H. to quell certain
disturbances there and to punish Laddardeo of Warangal who had
again become refractory, and Khusrau seems to have accompanied the _
prince. Deogir, then known as Qutbabad,® appears to have captured

the poet’s fancy, and in an ode he describes its charms and amenities
at great length. ‘ Wonderful and auspicious city ’, he says, ‘ the queen.
of the blessed realm which received the name of Qutbaibid from the
Pivot of the World. When infidelity prevailed here people were -
oppressed by demons and that is why the ancient deo? named it Deogir. |
Now that it has become the “ egg ” of Islam nothing but the noble and
divine phoenix of happy augur can take its birth in it. It is no flattery
to call it paradise, but I do not call it that, lest it be confounded with
the paradise of Shaddid. The city was surely destined to become a
paradise under Islamic rule, for that is why it has been so carefully
decorated ..... It is due, perchance, to hearing the fame of this city
that Cairo has dipped her robe in the nil® and Baghdad has split into
two. The air is so pleasamt that it produces only joy similar to that
promised to men of good deeds in the next world..... How can I
describe its fruit? The fruit of all the world is jealous of it. There
are the bananas curved like the crescent-moon, and as pleasant as the
‘Id-day. There is also the mango whose sweetness delights every palate
and which looks like a golden shell® full of milk and honey, and makes
the mouth of the sugar-candy water .... And then there is the wonderful
leaf, tanbul, which intoxicates life and heart with its pleasant taste ....
It has, again, so many pearls and precious stones that the ocean and the
mines are now unable to produce any more..... The fineness of its
cloths is difficult to describe: the skin of the moon removed by the
‘* executioner-star ”’® would not be so fine. One could compare it to a
drop of water if that drop fell, against nature, from the font of the
sun.’ A hundred yards of it can pass through the eye of a needle, so-
fine is its texture, and yet the point of a steel needle can pierce through
it only with difficulty.® It is so transparent and light that it looks as

Ulugh Khan, however, had to return back unsuccessful from
Warangal due to the stout resistance of Laddardeo and also to a panic
caused in his army by wild rumours about the death of his father spread
by some mischief-mongers* in his camp, who were probably tired of
fighting and wanted to go back to their homes. They were severely
punished on Ulugh Khan’s return to Delhi, and the prince after a few
months started again for the fortress. It was soon reduced and Laddardeo
with his wives and children fell into his hands and was sent to Delhi
with elephants and other spoils captured by the royal army. Ulugh
Khan named Warangal Sulténpur and settling the affairs in the south
satisfactorily he returned to Delhi.

Tughlaq Shah treated Khusrau very kindly and the poet was more
prosperous in his reign than he had been before. But the king was
not on very good terms with Sheikh Nizimuddin. Almost the first
thing he did after ascending the throne was to take strong measures to
retrieve the large sums that Khusrau Khan had so lavishly distributed
among the nobles and saints. The coffers filled by ‘Alauddin had almost
been emptied and the new king could not well proceed with the
government of the country with an exhausted treasury. Most of the

of the king. (Firishta, I, p. 131.) According to Barni (449) he was crucified alive.
See also Badaoni, I, 222 seq., who says he was trampled to death. According to
Ibn Battiitah Ulugh Khan himeelf encouraged the spread of these rumours. The
same view has been adopted by the editor of the Camb. Hist. of India, V. TII.
But there is no other evidence to show that.

recipients handed back the money which they had kept as a trust, but
NizSmuddin Auliya had spent all he had got in feeding the poor
darweshes and beggars that always crowded his monastery and, therefore,
could return nothing back.! This annoyed the king and he took a dislike
for the saint that lasted till his death. The puritan monarch, moreover,
looked askance at the rather convivial sima‘ gatherings* in the Sheikh’s
monastery and the rival and jealous sheikbs, seeing the king’s aversion
to such things, lost no time in painting the saint’s character in the darkest
hues. They represented to him that music was absolutely prohibited
by the law and that it was the greatest heresy for a pious man to indulge
in it. The king thereupon called Nizamuddin Auliya one day to his
presence and asked him to justify his conduct in the presence of divines
and scholars. The saint carried himself bravely and successfully through
the ordeal, and Tughlaq Sh&h had to let him go free, although, probably,
he was not quite satisfied with the saint’s arguments. He was, however,
too sensible and generous to persecute a man of Nizaémuddin’s reputed
piety and sanctity and the Sheikh did not suffer any hardships during
his reign.

Tughlaq Shah had a great passion for building * and he commenced
the foundation of a new city, and constructed a strong fortress in it
that acquired the name of Tughlaqibid. The fortress that now lies in
ruins must have been a magnificent structure when it was built.
Khusrau says of it: ‘Wonderful fortress that raises its head to the
moon, for it has been exalted by the ghazi king, Ghiyathuddin, the
great monarch whose justice is the architect of the world and the faith.
The fortress, named by the king Tughlaq&bad, is a paradise for the world.

Inside, it has a tank® (%)..... whose beauty gives and fosters life and
whose sweet water is a fountain of joy. Outside the fortress there is a
moat broad like the sea..... In the midst of the fortress is a splendid

palace whose brightness renders the crescent full moon. All its walls
are painted with gleaming gold and are studded with iridescent gems.
The cost of every gem that has been set on them is equal to the income
and expenditure of a world.’ ®

amounted to five lac tangahs.

ture unknown in India before that time. See Fergusson, ii, 215.

were gilded, and when the sun rose they glittered brightly and flashed so that the

In 724 4.’ Khusrau made his third and last journey to the eastern
‘provinces of Lakhnauti and Oudh. Tughlaq Shah, hearing of great
mismanagement in that part of the country and receiving numerous
complaints from people there, started, with a strong army, from Delhi,
leaving the capital in charge of his son, Ulugh Khan. Khusrau, as
usual, accompanied him, and stayed there for some months while the
king was busy in settling the provinces.

Nasiruddin of Lakhnauti® came to Tirhat and offered his homage
‘to the king. He was confirmed in his position and rank as the governor
of Lakhnauti, but the governor of Sunargaon, Bahadur Khban,* who
had been refractory, was deposed and disgraced. The rajah of Tirhat
was subjugated and the forest in that district cut down to prevent
‘thieves and robbers finding shelter there. Then the king turned back
towards Delhi. Some distance from Tughlaqibad he separated from
the main army and proceeded with rapid marches in order to reach the
-capital as soon as possible. Little did he know that it was fate that
was thus hastening him towards his death. Ulugh Khan, hearing of his
father’s hasty approach gave orders at once to decorate the city in his
honour, but fearing that the arrangements for the reception would not
be complete before the king’s arrival, he erected a pavilion about three
miles from the city in a place called Afghanpir. The pavilion, built in
the short space of two or three days was intended to shelter the king
for just one night before his triumphal entry into Tughlaqabid. The
prince greeted his royal father at Afghanpir and entertained him in the
pavilion. Food was set before him and his retinue but Ulugh Khan
left the pavilion before the king had finished his meal in order to get
ready the elephants which he had brought from Warangal and which
he wanted to display to his father. Most of the nobles also rose up
with the prince and the king was left with only a few companions. All
at once the roof of the pavilion collapsed and the king was buried beneath
it with four or five others and expired before he could be extricated from
the debris.

2 Firishta confuses him with Nasiruddin Bughra Khan, the son of Balban,
who was dead long before this. The text of the Riyadus-Salatin is also misleading.
According to the translator this Nagiruddin was a grandson of Bughra Khan, and
@ brother of Bahadur Shah. See also Camb. Hist. of India, iii, 132.

8 He was appointed governor of Bengal by ‘Alauddin but became independent .
during the reign of Qutbuddin and assumed the title of Bahadur Sh&h. See Riyéd-
us-Salétin (Bib. Ind. Text 89 and Trans., P- 90).

The mysterious fall of the pavilion has been the subject of a big
controversy and many historians have cast the blame on Ulugh Khan.
who is alleged to have purposely made the pavilion for getting rid of
his father! Ibn-i-Battiita even asserts that the prince showed culpable
negligence in taking Tughlaq Sh&h out of the ruins and delayed the
operations of excavating. But there is no other evidence to prove the
prince guilty of patricide. The contemporary historian, Barni, does not
even hint at that, and one cannot help saying with Firishta that, unless
one is ready to credit Ulugh Khan with supernatural powers, it was.
impossible for him to so arrange that the roof should fall just at a
certain moment—just when he himself was safe out of the pavilion and
the king was still in it. It is evident that the fatal event was an
accident pure and simple and that the collapse of the roof was due to
either faulty construction or to shock caused by a thunderbolt or the
heavy tread of the numerous elephants being paraded about the pavilion.
Still less credible is the story which ascribes the event to the pious anger
of Nizimuddin Auliya. It is said that Tughlaq Shah, who had always.
been rather suspicious about him, had sent orders to the saint to leave
the city before his arrival there back from Lakhnauti. As the king
approached nearer, the saint’s disciples requested him to depart from his
monastery lest any harm might overtake him. ‘It is a long way to
Delhi yet ’, was the only reply they could get from him, and so the king
met his death before he could reach the city.”

Apart from the improbability of such a bitter grudge being enter-
tained by the king against the saint, the fact that the saint had been.
grievously ill months before he died * would make the story very unlikely.
Seven months before his death, Nizimuddin Auliya was confined to.
his bed with a painful malady. He was already ninety-five years old,.
and knew that the end was approaching. One day he called his old and
faithful servant Iqbal and asked him to distribute at once all the money
and grain that arrived in the monastery among deserving people, and.

1 See Badaoni, I, 225; Ibni Battiita (Defrémery), iii, p. 211 seq. According
to the latter the pavilion, constructed mainly of wood, was so arranged that its.
roof could fall by the tread of elephants on a certain place about it, and was.
designed by Ahmed bin Ayds, a skilful geometrician and architect, who later got
the title of Khwaja-i-Jahan and became Muhammad Tughlaq’s favourite minister.

2 See Firishta, II, 398; and Badaoni, I, 225. ‘Haniiz Dihlt dir ast’ has, of
course, become a proverbial phrase. ee

8 Tbni Battiita, in fact, asserts that the saint had died before the king’s return
to Delhi, and that Tughlaq Shah was offended by Prince Jun& Khan carrying his:
corpse on his shoulder. (Vide Defrémery, iii, 211.) But we know from more reliable-
sources that the saint died on 18 Rabi‘ II, while the king met his death by the
' fall of the pavilion in the month of Rabi‘ I, See Firishta, I, 132, and I, 398,
ete. See also Prof. Habib (42 f.n.), who.apparently accepta Ibn-i-Battiita’s version...

not to keep back a single piece of money or a grain of corn. He then
prepared himself for death and calling his favourite disciples to his
bedside bestowed on them robes and appointed them his successors in
various parts of the country. His own ‘kbirga’, staff, prayer-carpet,
rosary and wooden bowl, together with other relics inherited from
Fariduddin Ganj-i-Shakar, he gave to Maulana Nasiruddin of Oudh, the
Bright Lamp of Delhi, who thus succeeded his master in the metropolis.
At sunset, the eighteenth of Rabi‘ IT, the saint gave up the ghost.

His life had been one long struggle against poverty, against self
and against sin, and his guidance led many a wandering sheep to the
security of the fold, and even if we do not, as we cannot, believe in all
the miracles ascribed to him by his enthusiastic admirers, we cannot
help acknowledging his greatness. Prince Ulugh Khan himself carried
his body on his shoulder on its journey to the grave! and for generations
his tomb has been the place of pilgrimage for princes as well as beggars.
Living, as he did, in an age full of sudden political changes, cruel murders,
wars and intrigues, his name has often been associated with some of the
events that occurred in his life-time and some uncritical historians have
not hesitated in casting aspersions on his character. He has been
described as an assassin and a head of the thugs—charges which are as
groundless as mean. The fact is that his personality and career are
the noblest things that catch our imagination in an age not lacking in
nobility, chivalry and romance, in spite of all its internecine wars,
political upheavals, intrigues and assassinations. While monarchs
came and went and dynasties rose and fell, while ambitious princes
fought and contested, conspired and planned, and while courtiers flattered
and betrayed, the saint stuck to the duty which he had imposed upon
himself and carried on his work of spiritual salvation calmly and quietly
in his sequestered monastery at Ghiyathpir ? :

‘ As some tall cliff that lifts its awful form

Swells from the vale and midway leaves the storm
Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread,
Eternal sunshine settles on its head.’

Yet, as we have said above, the doors of his monastery were open
to all and on one was turned off disappointed.* His disciples included
—

1 So, at least, asserts Ibni Battiitah (vide Defrémery, iii, 211), although I am
not inclined to place much reliance on his assertion, for he is hopelessly inaccurate
in his narration of the historical events of this period.

‘ 2 The village is now called Nizampir after the saint but the old name Ghiydthpir.
still survives and has been given to a subdivision of the village. (See a Guide
to Nizamuddin, p. 3.)

8 Thus Amir Hasan relates how wandering darweshes whom he calls ‘jawaliq’,
used to frequent the monastery and how: one of them once used very improper:

136

men of all creeds and classes, and what if some of them were thugs ?
That a class of people like the thugs should have respect and veneration
for him does not necessarily mean that he was an accomplice or that
he in any way encouraged them in their reprehensible conduct. Criminals
and malefactors have always been notoriously superstitious and eager
to atone for their crimes by some meritorious deed of piety—a candle
lighted on some shrine, flowers strewn on a holy tomb-stone, veneration
shown and homage paid to some saint or pir. What if some of them
respected Nizémuddin Auliya or even if they made him presents out of
the money they had acquired by foul and unlawful means? The Sheikh
never questioned. He accepted their homage and their offerings just
as he accepted the money given him by the ungrateful traitor, Khusrau
Khan. Where is the harm if the money so acquired was spent on poor
and needy persons ? It was perhaps robbed from some fat and miserly
merchant or a tyrannical landlord and was in any case lost to its owner.
If a portion of it could be redeemed from the filchers and spent in a
good cause no sane person should have any objection.

Nizaémuddin Auliya has also been accused of taking an active, and
by no means glorious, part in some of the political events of his time,
but such accusations made by irresponsible historians have no weight
and can never be accepted as proofs of his guilt by any impartial student
of history.

Khusrau, who, as we have seen above, was away in Oudh with the
royal army while his master, the Sheikh, lay ill in Delhi, heard of his
death only on his arrival in the capital. The sad news of the final and
irrevocable separation after years of friendship and love broke the heart
of the aged poet. He rent his garments, blackened his face and betook
himself to the grave of the Sheikh. According to a pathetic old legend,
he recited the following beautiful ‘doha’ at the grave and fell down in a
swoon : *

Gori sowe sej par, mukh par dare kes,
Chal Khusro ghar apne, rain bahi sab des.!

—

‘The fair one lies on the couch with her black tresses scattered on
her face: O Khusrau, come home now, for night has fallen all over
the world.’ ‘My end is now not far off’, he is said to have declared,
‘for the Sheikb had told me that I would not survive him long’. And
80 it was, for he died only a few months after, on Friday night, the 29th

words before the Sheikh who listened patiently and was very kind to him. (Vide
Faw&id-ul-Fuaéd. B.M. M&., f. 26.)

of Dbulga‘d, 725 #.,1 and was buried at the foot of his master’s grave.
It is said Niz&émuddin Auliya had desired that he should be buried by his
side. ‘He is the keeper of my secrets,? and I shall not set foot
in Paradise without him. If it were lawful, I should have instructed
you to bury him in the same grave with me so that we two may always
remain together.’® On Amir Khusrau’s death, then, his friends wanted
to bury him beside his master under the cupola on the latter’s grave,
but an attendant of the tomb, a Khwajasara,‘ objected, saying that the
two graves would be confused by people and so the poet was laid to
rest outside the cupola.® There he lies to this day and his grave has
become a place of pilgrimage almost as important as that of his sheikh,
so that he could say in the words of another immortal bard, Hafiz :
Bar sar-i-turbat-i-m& chiin guzari himmat kbwah,
Ki ziyaratgah-i-rindain-i-jahin khwahad bid.®

He had seen many changes and revolutions in his life-time and
from his grave he has seen many more. The old Delhi is now a wilder-
ness of ruins, the Red Palace, the Green Pavilion, the Palace of a thousand
pillars, and the New Palace, the scenes of his poetic successes are ‘ one
with Nineveh and Tyre’, and can hardly be traced in the tangle of ruins
that stretches for miles outside Delhi—the new Delhi of Shahjahan.
The strong citadel of Tughlaq is still there, grand and defiant, but one
looks in vain in it for the crystal springs and the golden walls. The
saint and his beloved disciple, however, sleep in peace in their sanctuary.
There is still a green cover over their graves, still fresh flowers are strewn
on them and still the lamp lights the darkness and attracts the moths,
and still the qawwals sing and recite ghazals of divine love at their
shrines, while tombs of mighty kings like ‘Alauddin have disappeared
or are but mounds of decaying bricks and plaster. Whether they will
rise together and enter Paradise hand in hand on the day of Judgment,
nobody can foresee, but certainly they have passed into immortality

together and their names shall ever be linked together in the memory
of succeeding generations.!

Strangely enough no building is known to have been erected on
the grave of Khusrau till the time of Baber, when Mahdi Khwaja ?
erected an enclosing wall and a marble tablet bearing a chronogram
inscription composed by Shihab Mu‘ammai, whom Firishta calls his
teacher Perhaps this was due to the poet’s own wish, or it is possible
that the earlier structure was entirely removed and replaced by the
present one. The inscription runs as follows :

‘There is no god but Allah and Muhammad is his Apostle.’

The earth was exalted by the erection of this tablet in the reign
of Baber, the ghazi emperor.

‘Mir (Amir) Khusrau, the king of poesy’s realm ; that ocean of
accomplishment and sea of perfection ;

His prose was more pleasant than flowing water and his poetry
purer than sweet, limpid waters ;

The _matchless nightingale of melodious songs and the peerless
parrot of sweet speech ;

When I placed my thoughtful head on my knee in order to
compose a chronogram on his death, two chronograms
occurred to me: ‘The Peerless’ and ‘The Parrot of Sweet
Speech ’.

“The tablet on my dust is innocent of any talk of union with
the beloved : my innocent ways prove sufficiently the purity
of my love.’

‘Mahdi Khwaja, the great and glorious Sayyid is verily the
founder of this structure. When they asked me the date of
erection, I said: The praiseworthy effort of Mahdi Khwaja.’

In the year 938 H. (1531-2 a.p.), during the reign of Humayin
an inner enclosure was built and paved with marble, and a marble

is held at the tomb of the poet on the 17th and 18th of Shawwal. The two tombs
.are looked after by the descendants of the saint’s sister who are called ‘ pirzddas’.

tomb-stone was placed over the grave. Inscriptions of this emperor
are found onthe north and west walls of the enclosure. Again in the
year 969 Hw. (1561 a.p.) Shihabuddin Ahmed Khan, a noble of the time
of Akbar erected a dome with latticed walls of red sandstone over the
grave. The present tomb,! however, was built during the reign of
Jahangir in the year 1014 H. (1605-6 a.v.) by Khwaja ‘Imaduddin
Hasan: Inscriptions of the founder and of Jahangir are found on the
top of the four walls * and on a marble tablet fixed on the northern wall
respectively. :

In 1280 u. (1663-4 a.D.) a pair of copper-plated door-leaves was
presented by one Mianjan bearing an inscription in Urdu and in 1303 a.
{1886 a.D.) Muhyiddin Khan of Hyderabad erected a pierced marble
balustrade round the grave bearing his name and the date.

1 M. Zafar Hasan describes the present tomb thus : ‘The tomb of Amir Khusrau
lies in a small enclosure 28’ 6” by 20’ 7”, surrounded by red sandstone walls of
lattice work. The enclosure paved with marble is entered through a door-way
on the south, where it is partly roofed with stone slabs. The tomb-chamber,
which is oblong in plan, measures 16’ 2” by 12’ 6” externally, and is constructed
of marble. It is covered by a vaulted roof supported on 12 pillars and crowned
by two ‘ guldastas’, one at either end on the north and south. The space between
these pillars is closed by latticed screens, the central bay on the south being open
and serving as an entrance to the tomb. Outside the tomb chamber to the north
stands an inscribed marble slab 7’ 11” by 1’ 63” set up during the reign of the
emperor Baber, while on the south lies an uninscribed and unplastered grave said
to be that of Shamsuddin Mahru, the son of Amir Khusrau’s sister. The marble
grave of Khusrau in the centre of the building is enclosed by a marble balustrade.
It is ever kept covered by a pall and a cotton canopy hangs over it tied with ropes
to the four corners of the chamber.’

saint. Thus one is:

CHAPTER IV.
Tue Works.

Amir Khusrau was one of those few lucky authors who live long
enough to see their fame spread far and wide, to have the satisfaction
of their worth being recognized by their contemporaries and to be able
to visualize the prospect of an ever increasing popularity and renown
down in the depths of time among generations and nations yet unborn.
He had, moreover, the good fortune of being able to collect and
arrange most of his works during his life-time. This was by no means
an easy task, for the poet, a prolific writer, had hardly any leisure for
the troublesome task of piecing together scattered odds and ends of
poetry that came so profusely and rapidly from his lips that the pen
could scarcely keep pace with their swift flow. He had, besides, other
duties to perform. -As an officer and-courtier he had to be a regular
attendant at the courts of his patrons some of whom, caring little, perhaps,
for poetry, were quite hard task-masters. Yet with an extraordinary
genius for poetry Khusrau combined an almost supernatural energy
and an indefatigable capacity for work, and he did the work of editing
his own compositions with a thoroughness and care that cannot but
excite our admiration. ll his five diwans are preceded by prefaces and
introductions, which, in some cases are very long and full, and most-of
his qagdid are headed by verses descriptive of their contents. He also
gives the number of the qasaid in each of his diwins as well as that of
the fragments and the dates when they were composed. His mathnawis
too are all accompanied by a full description of the occasions on which
they were composed, their dates, names and the number of verses in
each of them. The poet, in fact, himself an artist, had very definite
views as to not only how a book should be edited, but how it should be
transcribed, and in the I‘jaz-i-Khusrawi he gives some interesting
instructions + for the guidance of scribes.

1 [‘jaz-i-Khusrawi, V. I, R.1., 80-82. Thus he says that the scribe, who must
be well-paid, should compare his copy with the original three times for ‘a correct
writing is the light of the eye but its reverse is darkness though it may have been
done with the black pupil of the eye’. He must employ two inks, red and black,
the red to be used for distinguishing the different subjects, chapters, and divisions
of the book. He should, moreover, employ a third ink of a colour other than red
and black to mark some words or phrases of special import or interest. Dots and
vowel marks should be carefully given and in the case of Arabic phrases a com-
mentary may also be added to clear the sense. In conclusion he says :

¥

Amir Khusrau was also helped by his friend, Tajuddin Zahid, and
some of other friends in this stupendous task. His friend, Zahid, indeed,
first induced him to arrange and edit the poems of his earliest years and
seems to have assisted the poet in his later compilations also.. Another
friend, ‘Alduddin ‘Ali Shih, who like Zahid appears to have been on
very intimate terms with Khusrau for he is often referred to by the
poet as ‘ my brother ’,’ and who was a scribe of great merit, undertook
to transcribe his works, while some other friends, notably Shihibuddin,?
carefully revised the compilations before Khusrau presented them in
their final form to the public, and Khusrau has duly expressed his
gratitude to all of them in the course of his writings.®

Yet in spite of all this care and labour it is likely that Amir Khusrau
could not arrange all his works before his death. Perhaps, he had no
time and also, perchance, no inclination to do so, for a man of his
character would attach no great value to stray compositions on the
manifold subjects that his versatile mind turned to'from time to time.
It is more likely, again, that some of his works which existed in collected
and arranged forms in his time have since been lost, so that there is a.
strong reason to presume that the works of Amir Khusrau that are
known to us to-day are by no means complete and that some of his
productions have been irretrievably lost. But what is the probable
extent of this loss ? We shall try to discuss this question briefly here. ,

' There is a considerable amount of discrepancy among various
versions given by biographers as to the number and volume of Khusrau’s
works. The contemporary historian, Barni, is vague on this point.
According to Jami, one of the oldest authorities on the subject, the
number of his works was ninety-nine ‘ and he has been followed by other
biographers.© Daulat Shah asserts that Amir Khusrau himself has
said in the course of his writings that his verses amount to léss than

1 From this fact and the similarity of the two names ‘Alduddin has been con-
fused with ‘Izzuddin by some biographers. See Shibli, II, 123; Rieu, II, 609 seq.
(Re Ghurra), etc.

2 For Shihabuddin see infra.

8 Khusrau’s idea of how a diwan should be arranged can be seen in an ornate
passage in the preface to the Baqiya Naqlya (1.0. MS., 1187, fol. 324). According
to him it should consist of a prose preface, odes (qasaéid), tarji‘ét, mathnawis,
rub&‘Is, and certain fragments of harmless satire and pleasantry.

4 See Nafabh&t-ul-Uns, p. 710. Barni says ‘he has written a whole library
(SlebS ) i in poetry and prose’.

five but more than four hundred thousand verses,! and Amin Razi, in
his Haft Iqlim gives the number of his works as one hundred and ninety-
nine. Yet curiously enough none of these biographers gives a list of _
these works and if they do, the number does not exceed by any great
extent the number of works that are known to us to-day. Regarding
the assertion made by Daulat Shah and Firishta about the number of
Khusrau’s verses, I am not inclined to attach any importance to it,
In the first place, in spite of careful study of all his works, I have failed
to discover that statement anywhere. Secondly, even supposing Khusrau
does make that statement, it is not clear what is meant by the term
‘bait ’, which can be interpreted, as Shibli points out, both in the sense
of a couplet as well as a hemistich, and in the latter case ‘the volume of
Khusrau’s poetry would not be anything very stupendous or extra-
ordinary. Lastly, such a statement by the poet, made presumably
some time before his death, cannot be the last word on the extent of his
works for we know that he continued writing poetry right up to his last
days, and an exact estimate of an author’s works can only be made by a
second person after his death. Was any attempt made immediately
after the poet’s demise to collect or arrange his works ?

Among the earliest records, we find only two references to any
serious endeavour being made in this direction. According to Daulat
Shah, Mirza Baiysunghar * once tried to collect the poet’s verses, and after
_ great trouble and effort secured one hundred and twenty thousand verses.
- But he was informed afterwards of the existence of another two thousand
verses not included in any of the diwans, and so realizing the impossibility
of securing all the verses composed by the poet, Baysunghar gave up
the idea. Then we learn that a poet called Saifi collected and edited
Amir Khusrau’s works and a preface by him is appended to a manuscript
of the Kulliyét now in the St. Petersburg library. But we have no
idea about the exact date of Saifi or of the scope and value of the work
done by him.®

(Lucknow, 4a.H. 1314, pp. 130-2), :

2 Mirza Bayeunghar, the son of Sultan Mahmid Mirza and the grandson of
Sultan Abii Sa‘id Mirza, was a contemporary of Baber by whom he was driven
from Samargand in a.B. 903. He later occupied Hisér but in a.H. 905 he was
treacherously murdered by Khusrau Shah, an Amir of his father’s court. Like
Sultan Husain Mirza, he was a great patron of letters. See Rieu 526; Erskine :

Husain Mirza under the patronage of Mir ‘Al Shir Nawal. He subsequently
remained for three years at Samarqand as preceptor to BAysunghar Mirza and it

The fact that very little of the literature of the so-called ‘ Pathan’
period has come down to us, denotes a deplorable lack of enthusiasm
for letters among the later Turkish kings and possibly also an equally
deplorable apathy on the part of the early Moghuls. One wonders
what became of all the wonderful products of great scholars that, for
instance, adorned the reign of ‘Aliuddin. Barni and Firishta give
long lists of savants living in that age whose activity embraced all
branches of knowledge and who wrote both in Persian as well as Arabic.
There were jurists, theologians, philosophers, historians, physicians,
musicians, writers and poets of great merit and wide renown that had
helped to make Delhi, for a time, actually the literary centre of the
Islamic world, if not the religious centre, or Darul-Khilafa as its pre-
tentious rulers and their flattering sycophants claimed it to be. Accord-
ing to Khusrau himself every stone in Delhi concealed a gem of literary
brilliance } and there were scholars and poets whose Arabic verses could
shame Imru-al-Qais and restore to life Ibni Jinni.2 ‘ Behold’, he says
elsewhere, ‘what an atmosphere surrounds our land for its air is full
of the songs of birds. Artists, poets and singers spring like grass from
its dust. There have been good poets and fine singers before this age,
no doubt, whose imagination was keen and who knew the subtle points
of their art, but the ideas that blossom forth now, rarely appeared in
other ages. Each of these poets and singers has a unique style peculiar
to himself. The least of them all is humble Khusrau.’*®

Many of the poets mentioned are said to have been ‘ sahib-i-diwan ’,
that is, they had already collected and arranged their verses. One of’
them, Shihabuddin,‘ who is specially admired by Khusrau and described
as a great scholar of Arabic, was consulted on several occasions by the
poet. Yet, to-day we not only do not possess any work by him, but
also find it difficult to establish his identity.® In fact, leaving aside

is probable that it was during this time that he, at the instance of Baysunghar
Mirza, undertook the task of editing Khusrau’s works, but he apparently could
not finish it. He died probably in 909 a.H. See Rieu 525; Baber Namah
(Beveridge), 288 ; Habibus Siyar, iii, part 3, p. 593.

4 It would appear from Khusrau’s remarks about him that he never collected
his poems. ‘If’, says Khusrau, ‘he had the leisure to collect his diwin... etc.’

5 He was probably the same poet whom Barni and Firishta describe as Shihab-
i-Sadr Nashin among the poets of ‘Alduddin’s reign. But nothing more is known
about him. The fact that Khusrau often styles him as ‘Imam’ would induce
one to identify him with Shihabuddin, Imém of Nizémuddin Auliya (vide Siyar-ul-
Auliyé : Delhi, 1302 .,. pp. 290-2, but he is not known to have been a poet of
great repute. Another person of that name who was a contemporary of Nizamuddin
Auliyé was a son of Khwaja Farid of Ajodhon (Ibid., pp. 186-8).

other sciences, the poetry of that period is now known to us almost
only through the works of Khusrau and his brilliant contemporary
Hasan, and it is fortunate that these works, according to contemporary
and subsequent testimony, represent the best form of it.

When so much, then, of the literature—in fact the bulk of it—of
those days has entirely been lost, one may reasonably presume that
whatever has been preserved is also not complete ; that the works of
Khusrau that exist to-day, are by no means all that he produced. Yet
at the same time, it is very doubtful if he ever produced as many as
‘ninety-nine works. There is a limit to human industry and literary
prolixity. Khusrau, we admit, wrote with a rapidity and ease that is
really extraordinary and he continued writing throughout his long life,
but still one should think that the works we now possess are quite a
respectable monument, both in quality and quantity, of a life of literary
labours even like those of Khusrau’s, especially when we remember that
the poet had so many other occupations and diversions. Khusrau,
moreover, in several places in his writings, specifies his works, which
oan be roughly classified as poetical and prose. Of the former, we know
definitely the number of qasaid and fragments ! in each of the five diwans,
for Khusrau gives the number usually in the preface or at the conclusion.
In the mathnawis too we can verify the number of verses the poet
composed. as here again the poet supplies the necessary information.
Now most of the manuscript copies of these works have preserved with
tolerable accuracy the contents outlined by Khusrau and may be said
to be complete. The only part of his poetry where we cannot be so sure
of a complete preservation are the ghazliyat,? for it is a pity that Khusrau
did not attach much importance to those sweet lyrics that have, more
than anything else, won him the title of the ‘ Parrot of India’, and
consequently never took the trouble of arranging them and it was left
to the will and fancy of subsequent students to prepare compilations and
collections of varying lengths under different names. ‘I have’, he says,
‘composed many a fresh ghazal, but I did not include them (in this
diwin) as a ghazal is but of seven or nine verses and anyone who can
scrawl seven or nine verses would strut like a refractory camel and try
to compete and vie with me, though I am the king of poetry’? It is
possible then, that some of these poems were lost, but kt the same time,

1 Mugqatta‘&t ; short fragmentary poems on diverse topics. .

® The collections of ghazals found in the I.0. and B.M. manuscripts of Kulliyat
under the heading ‘ Kitéb-ul-ghazliyat’ are more or less identical in contents
which would suggest that they were collected and arranged by some one at some
period after the poet’s death. The fact that the collection is not preceded by any
introduction by the poet shows that Khuarau himself did not arrange them.

8 Dib&che, of Ghurra, -

it is also possible that some of them, now ascribed to Khusrau, never
belonged to him. On the whole, we may safely conclude that the
bulk of these poems has also been preserved. The only poetical work
which is mentioned by reliable authorities to have been composed by
Khusrau and which we do not possess to-day is, the Tughlaq Namah,
the history of the reign of Ghiyéthuddin Tughlaqshih. But as that
monarch reigned for only about three years, the loss of the Tughlaq
Namah, is perhaps, not so great after all historically, while from a literary
point of view, the mathnawi, its language and style, could not be very
different from those of his other mathnawis, the Nuh Sipihr, for in-
stance, which he wrote in the reign of Mubarak Shah, the immediate
predecessor of Tughlaq Shah.?

Regarding his prose works, again, we know from the preface of
the I‘jaéz-i-Khusrawi that Khusrau had not written anything in prose
before that. He had, of course, written letters and epistles, which he
has collected together in that book, but he had produced no connected
work in prose. We know also that the poet had no special liking, and
also no special aptitude for this branch of literature and therefore it seems
extremely unlikely that Khusrau could have composed much more than
that stupendous work, I‘jaz-i-Khusrawi, and the two smaller works
Tarikb-i-‘Aldi or Khazain-ul-futiih and Afdal-ul-fawaid in the short space
of about fifteen years.

The only other subject, perhaps, to which Khusrau could be ex-
pected to have turned his prolific pen is music, and one is easily induced
to believe that he wrote, as some biographers assert, a treatise on that
fascinating science.® If he did really write such a treatise, it is very
unfortunate that it has not come down to us, for a book on that subject
would have supplied very valuable information on the development of
Indian music especially in the transition period that commenced in

1 Thus a beautiful poem, ascribed to ‘Ubaid Zakani in B.M. MS. Or., 6303
(vide Browne: Pers. under Tartar Dom., p. 235) and beginning as

is found also in two MSS, of Khusrau’s works (B.M., No. Add. 21,104, f. 861 and
‘No. 25,807); and the last verse containing the poet’s name is given thus :

She Gate te So 6 tae ot ote F
while Browne gives it as OL tote a 6) So Be Oe te 3 ae er
The words ge lel. are changed to ‘Sultan-i-Husni’ in the former.

(istifa 2); end music”.

+

those days by the fusion of Persian and Indian systems which, according
to tradition, Khusrau did much to bring about. But here again we
can be sure that the poet’s writings, if any, did not amount to any big
or monumental work. In an interesting fragment descriptive of the
poet’s contest with a musician regarding the comparative excellence of
the two sciences, poetry and music, he says: ‘I told him (the musician)
that I was perfect in both the sciences and had practised both in the
proper way ; that I had written three volumes (daftars) in poetry and
if I were to write on music I could have composed three volumes on
that science too ’.!

This proving as it does the poet’s proficiency in music, shows
incidentally also that he did not compose at least any comprehensive
work on that science.

If, therefore, we leave aside Khusrau’s work in Hindi poetry which
we propose to discuss in a separate chapter, we are inclined to surmise
that the bulk of his writings both in poetry and prose have been pre-
served and have been transmitted to us through succeeding generations
without any serious damage or decrease. But how to explain the per-
sistent and old tradition of more than ninety works? I think here we
have a common instance of popular exaggeration to deal with. There
is a general tendency to ascribe to great men things that never belonged
to them and to exaggerate their exploits. We can imagine this tendency
in a very marked degree in the case of Khusrau, who was, perhaps, the
most popular poet of India and whose name is known even to the mis-
chievous urchins of Delhi, playing marbles in some narrow alley beside
a dirty gutter even to-day about seven centuries after his death! We
know, for instance, that some of the existing works said to be Khusrau’s
are definitely not his. Such is the Story of the Four Darweshes, which,
in spite of clear internal evidence to the contrary, has been persistently
ascribed to Khusrau by even literary men like Mir Amman, its translator.
Such are again a poem called Shahnéma-i-Khusrawi and another known
as Inshé-i-Khusrau of both of which we shall speak later on.

Then certain poems of Khusrau’s have been mentioned under
different names by various authors and so one book with three names,
like the ‘Ashiga,® for instance, may easily be counted three by an un-
scrupulous biographer. Again certain longer poems from his five diwans,

Dewalrént-o-Khidr Khan, Nuskba-i-Khidr Khan, Aghaz-i- ‘Tshq and Manshir
Sh&h!. (See Prolegomens : Ishiq Khan, p. 14.)

147

such as Bahrul ‘Ibar, or Faras Namah, or even certain portions of his
mathnawis have been enumerated by certain biographers as independent
works. There are, moreover, numerous collections, as we have said
above, of his ghazliyat, made by various persons from time to time,
varying in extent and contents and going under different titles that
may be taken as separate books by any uncritical student.

It is also quite likely that Khusrau wrote occasional tracts on all
sorts of topics, on music and musical instruments, on chess or back-
gammon, on poetical niceties and artifices, and the like and that these
treatises were counted with his other works to complete the tale of
ninety and nine. But that these treatises were numerous or very
valuable I am not quite prepared to believe, and cannot agree with the
late Nawab Ishaq Khan in thinking that the ‘ greater part of his works
is now irretrievably lost’. I think, on the other hand, for reasons
already given, that whereas we have lost most of the literary productions
of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the great fame of Amir
Khusrau, his pre-eminent skill, and the odour of sanctity that has always
clung to his memory, have worked together to save the best: and most
important part of his-Persian works from the sad fate that overtook
the works of his less fortunate and less gifted contemporaries.

That Khusrau wrote anything in Arabic, other than some small
poems or single verses scattered through his works is extremely unlikely.
He admits himself his incompetence in that language and writing at the
age of forty declares that he could have, if he had found leisure, acquired
as great a mastery over that language as over Persian, but that it was
too late then to ‘see such idle dreams’... We can, thus, safely dismiss
as untenable any theories regarding his works in Arabic and reject as
a myth the absurd story that he translated the Gulistin of Sa‘di into
Arabic.2 He was too sensible to do that and could utilize his time
much better.

After these introductory remarks, I now turn to a consideration of
Khusrau’s works that exist to-day in their more or less complete forms
in the various libraries in Europe, India, and Egypt.

1 To these, of course, we must add another important factor already enumerated,
namely Khusrau’s own industry in collecting them and his jealous care of their
contents. How anxious the poet was concerning the preservation of his works
may be seen by what he says at the conclusion of one of his diwans (Wast-ul-Hayat :

1.0. MS., 1187). Fa 4

In 1915, the late Nawab Ishiq Kh&n, at the instance of Nawab
‘Imédul Mulk Maulvi Syed Husain Bilgrimi, formed the ambitious
project of editing and publishing the complete works of Khusrau, and
with this end in view the Nawab made a thorough study of the various
catalogues of European, Indian, and Egyptian libraries. Not content
with this, and believing that a large number of the poet’s works—the
better half in fact of the mythical tale of ninety-nine, was still missing
he made a wide and patient search throughout India for discovering
any works still unknown and lying concealed in the mouldy shelves of
some rickety library. But with all his industry and zeal he could trace
only 45 (forty-five) works, viz. (1) Tubfatus-Sighar, (2) Wast-ul-
Hayét, (3) Dibacha-i-Ghurrat-ul-Kamal], (4) Diwan Ghurrat-ul-Kamil,

Miftéh-ul-futith, (15) Collected Mathnawiyyat, (16) Collected Rubaiyat,
(17) Collected poems, (18) Qasida-i i-Amir Khusrau, containing the story
of Firdausi’s Shih Nama, (19) I‘jazi-i-Khusravi, (20) Insha-i-Khusrau,
(21) Ahw&l-i-Amir Khusrau, (22) Nihayat-ul-Kamél, (23) Khazain-ul-

Shigarf Bay&n, (44) Taréna-i-Hindi, (45) Munajat-i-Khusrau.

The Nawab after giving this list, remarks: ‘The Baznama, Asp
Nama, Bahrul Ibar, Mirat-us-Safa included in the above list are names
of particular mathnavis and Qasidas which form portions of Amir
Khusrau’s diwans. A manuscript copy of Shahr-Ashub was obtained
from Lucknow ..... Regarding the Tughlaq Nama nothing has so far
been learnt beyond the fact that Mir Mehdi Hasan Majruh of Delhi had
® manuscript copy of this book. With regard to the remainder of the
works included in the above list, we have not hitherto been able to dis-
cover even the trace of their existence in this country.’! This eliminates

No. 28 to No. 45, both inclusive. My esteemed friend Mr. Zubaid Ahmed has,
however, pointed out to me a MS. in the Tippoo Sultan’s Library (Cat. Stewart,
1809, p. 26) with the title Magl&t-i-Amir Khuerau: memoirs of the first four
Khalife..... with a treatise on sufi tenets, which is. evidently the same work

sixteen of the eighteen works beginning from No. 28, and we are left
with only twenty-nine works. Of these twenty-nine, again, as we.
shall see, Nos. 3 and 4 are really one work, while Nos. 15, 16, and 17
are evidently selections from the works of Amir Khusrau and form no
independent works ; Nos. 18 and 20 as well as No. 27 do not certainly
belong to Khusrau, while No. 26 is of doubtful origin. Thus there are
only twenty-one works which may definitely be described as independent
works by Khusrau and which are, with the exception of one, available
to-day. All of these works, with the exception of Nisib Badi‘-ul-‘Ajaib
and Nisib Muthallath, and Shahr-Ashib are found in the library of the
British Museum, and most of them exist also in the India Office library,
and I now start to give a detailed account of these works. For convenience
and lucidity I propose to study the works under the following heads
and i ip the order given in the list below: + Clermereee \a

‘A. The five diwdins: (1) Tuhfat-us-Sighar, (2) Wast-u hayat, (3)
Ghurrat-ul-Kamial, (4) Baqiya Naqiya, (5) Nihaéyat-ul-Kamil.

* -B. The historical poems: (6). Qirfn-us-Sa‘dain, (7) Miftah-ul-futih,
(8) ‘Ashiga, (9) Nuh Sipihr, (10) Tughlaq Namah.
‘OC. The Khamsa: (11) Matla‘-ul-Anwar, (12) Shirm-o-Khusrau, (13)

fdal-ul-fawaid, (19) Ijz-i-Khusrawi. ° >! (19)

‘F. Hindi Poetry: (20) The Khaliq Bari and other Hindi poems

scribed to Khusrau.

Before proceeding any further, however, I shall give briefly my
reasons for rejecting certain works ascribed to Khusrau either on account
of popular belief or through an oversight on the part of cataloguers. I
shall, of course, leave out all such works which do not exist to-day and of
which the names alone can be traced in old biographies or in popular
legends, and consider only such works as are available and can be
examined, and of these latter there are three.! (1) The Qissa-i-Chahar
Darwesh, (2) Inshi-i-Amir Khusrau (No. 1221 of the India Office Cat.
of Persian MSS. described as an introduction to his work I‘jaz-i-Khusrawl),
and (3) The Ode of Amir Khusrau containing the History of the Shah
Nama of Firdausi : (Ind. Off. MS., No. 1195).

(1) The Tale of the Four Darweshes—Mir Amman in the preface to
his translation of this book says that the tale was written by Amir
Khusrau during a long illness of Sheikb Nizamuddin Auliya, and that .

1 I do not include Khaliq B&ri in this category for I propose to discuss this
work separately and also because the book may or may not be Khusrau’s. For an
account of sonie other works erroneously ascribed to Khusrau see the Prolegomena,
p. 15, neq.

he used to relate the story to him, till he recovered and blessed the
author as well as the book, whence it has acquired its peculiar popularity.?

Apart from the improbability of such an incident being the occasion
of its composition and the absurdity of the whole idea, the work certainly
cannot belong to Khusrau for the following reasons :—

1. The style of the prose in the book is quite different from that
of Amir Khusrau’s and belongs probably to a much later date.

2. Verses are very few—an unusual thing for Khusrau—and none
of them belongs to him, while Khusrau always employed his own verses
to adorn his prose.

3. Many words and expressions employed have never been used
by Khusrau or his contemporaries.”

4. Several terms used clearly belong to a later period.®

5. The writer knew a good deal more about the ‘ farangis’ (the
Europeans) than Khusrau could have known.‘

6. He mentions several articles and things unknown in India in
Khusrau’s time.®

7. Lastly, the author betrays a marked propensity for the Shi‘a
doctrine which we cannot imagine Khusrau® to have possessed.

The writer, whoever he was, lived, I think, in the early Moghul
period, probably during the reign of Jahangir or Shah Jahan.

(2) Insha-i-Khusrawi.—This is the title of a small collection of
letters in ornate prose (83ff. or 166 pages’? in all. I.0. MS., No. 1221)
which has been described in the India Office Catalogue (Col. 707) to be
a work of Khusrau, but the most cursory perusal of the work is enough
to convince one that it has nothing to do with the poet. In fact, it

The saint is said to have declared : ‘ Whoever will hear this tale, will, with the
blessing of God, remain in health’. Mir Amman’s translation, perhaps the first
book in Urdu prose, is not literal and the translator has even changed certain
details of the story, but on the whole it is true to the original.

was written by one Abdul Baqi Munshi of Aminabad (Deccan) in the
reign of Shabjahan, and comprises letters dictated by his master, Mirza
Ibréhim Beg, son of Hasan ‘Ali Khan Turkman (see fol. 70 et seq.
of the MS.). The whole style of. the prose, the verses quoted (some
of which belong to Khusrau himself and to much later writers) } and the
names of books? and persons mentioned would, moreover, clearly prove
it to be a work of the 17th century, even if the definite information about
its date and authorship were missing. The mistake has apparently
arisen from its title and the opening lines :

Of course, what the writer means is simply that he begins his book with
some verses of a mathnawi of Khusrau’s which follow immediately
after the first few sentences. The same work has been noted, under a
different title, by Nawab Ishaq Khan, as one of those books ascribed to
Khusrau but not belonging to him.®

(3) Qasida of Amir Khusrau (1.0. MS., No. 183).—A poem outlining
the episodes described by Firdausi in the Shahnémah and divided into two
parts, the first ending (on f. 13b) with the defeat of Afrasiab at the hands
of Kaus, and consisting of 362 verses, and the second part (214 verses),
bringing the story to a close, has been described as an ode of Amir
Khusrau—why, we do not’ know, for in this work, unlike the one
mentioned above, there is even no mention of Khusrau’s name. The
author, on the other hand, who styles himself Dihlavi, says clearly that
he completed the first half in 1066 H.4 and that the poem was finished in

in question happened to be endorsed by an ignorant possessor as wt) eka

We shall now turn to the genuine works of Khusrau that are avail-

able to-day and consider them one by one, beginning with the earliest,
Tuhfat-us-Sighar (the Present of Youth).

A. Tue First Diwin.
(1) Tuhfat-us-Sighar. 8

The first collection of Khusrau’s poems was made about the year
671 #. and contains, according to the poet’s own statement in the
preface, such poems as he composed from the age of sixteen to nineteen.
It was his great friend and patron, Tajuddin Zahid, who urged Khusrau
(then a mere youth and, as in the case of most young geniuses, very
diffident about the merits of his own poetry) to make the collection.

‘These verses’, he says, ‘like the natal hair of children were best
clipped off and so I did not want to preserve any of them, But my
friend, Zahid, whose subtle mind is a tire-woman for the tresses of poetry
(may God sethis affairs right) collected these scattered writings, hair by
hair, and having trimmed them, knit them up together.’ The poet
remonstrated with Zahid, saying that the collection was worthless and
should better be consigned to fire. He feared criticism from the poets
and scholars that were already both famous and numerous in Delhi.
But Tajuddin Zahid consoled him. ‘ Your critics,’ he said, ‘can be
but of two kinds: ignorant and knowing. If they are wise they would
certainly make allowances for your extreme youth, and if they are
foolish, it is a folly to be afraid of them.’ So, Khusrau, after a good

2 This poem, as far as I know, does not exist in any other library. It is written
in a smooth flowing metre and the opening lines are very much like some odes of

Qéani. The author Dihlavi may be the same person as Mohd. Sadiq (or Sadiq
Khan) Dihlavi, the writer of Shahjahin Namah. Beg. : (after a rubai) :-—

deal of hesitation agreed and wrote verses descriptive of each of the
poems thus collected, so that when taken together these introductory
verses form & poem not of course continuous or consistent in sense, but
preserving the form of a qasida.1 This was an innovation of the poet,
and was, as we have noted above, quite helpful in the preservation of
his poems.

The diwain comprises thirty-five qasidas,? five tarji‘s and tarkib)
bands, several fragments, mostly small, and a short mathnawi descrip-
tive of thogpoes® unpleasant experiences in an Afghan fortress. Most
of the qasidas dfe in praise of Ghiyathuddin Balban ¢ and his son Prince
Muhammad Qaan Nasiruddin, the Martyr Prince, while others were
written for some of the nobles of Balban’s court, like Amir ‘Ali surnamed
Hatam Khan, Ikhtiyaéruddin Kishli Khan, Shamsuddin, Qiwamulmulk
‘Azizuddin, etc. One of the Tarkib-bands is an elegy on the death of his
grandfather, ‘Imadul Mulk, the ‘Arid,5 while another very interesting
poem is a dirge on the sad demise of two birds, pets of the poet.W

Khusrau in these early poems of his has often tried to imitate
Khaqini, the great master of Persia whose qasidas have always been
the model for ambitious poets and who even to-day is recognized to be
the greatest artist in writing such poems. It was not an easy task for
a young and untrained poet to imitate Khaqani, and Khusrau seems
to have met difficulties in spite of his brilliant poetic instinct. ‘For'
some time’, says he, ‘I followed in the footsteps of Khaqani and
imitated him as far as form is concerned, although I often found it
difficult to comprehend some of the words employed by him, and on
account of my youth could not often follow his ideas.’® Khusrau
then has tried to give to his poems a grandeur, a flow and a rhythm
that characterise the poems of Khaqani, but he has scrupulously avoided
the use of difficult words and expressions that often render the Persian
master’s poetry unintelligible to a man of ordinary intellect and

1 The verses are called Aby&at-i-Silsila or Abyat-i-Surkh, and I do not think
any poet, other than Khusrau has employed them. They are missing in the case
of several of the odes in the I.0. MS., 1,187. In this diwan they run like this:

elon cas Sr ae ye og! w dit opte OL colesls
etc. See the Dibacha of Tubfat-us-Sighar.

2 The number is the same in the I.0. MS., 1,187, and the B.M. MB8., 25,807,
but the first qasidas in the two manuscripts do not agree and there is a difference in
the sequence. The rest of the qasidas and tarji‘s, etc., are identical.

8 See supra.

4 This contradicts the statement of Sheikh ‘Abdul Haq that ‘there are but
few poems by Khusrau in praise of Balban’. (See Akbbar-ul-Akbyar, p. 100.)

5 See supra. . . : “

scholarship. But it is precisely these words and phrases that gave to
Kh&g4nt’s poems their peculiar grandeur and that delighted the minds
of his admirers. Khusrau was too young to succeed fully in his attempt
and he admits his own defeat, but any careful reader would clearly
see in these first fruits of a growing mind the promise of a greatness
as genuine as that of Khaqini.”

Anwari and Sandi were the other two masters that Khusrau tried
to imitate in his earlier days and in the Tuhfat-us-Sighar we find some
poems that are evidently written after Anwari.*

In several of these poems, as he says himself, th8 poet uses the
pen-name of Sultdni, bestowed upon him by Khwaja ‘Izzuddin. The
preface supplies some interesting biographical details of which we have
already availed ourselves and is written in a very ornate style that often
renders it difficult to follow the sense clearly. Here are a few lines
from the elegy on the two dead birds : JK?

‘When in the evening the “ phoenix of the sky” * went down, I
went to their cage to put in some more grains, but I found them both
lying cold and dead in the water basin on account of the extreme heat
-of the air..... Alas! their pretty heads with parted feathers like buds
and alas, their breasts more bloomful than jessamine! Their fresh and
-soft feathers like the silk of Cathay and new and warm like the velvet
of China! Let birds all over the world cry and weep for them.....
Let the dove-pigeons break their cords of captivity in their mad grief and
with their red tears paint a collar round their necks! Let the hoopoes

Soy

1‘ But the sublimity of those masters’ poetry was beyond the reach of my
ambition.’ (Dibacha.)

2 In fact, Khusrau’s odes after Khaqani are wonderful specimens of artistic
‘poetry. See, for. instance, odes No. 10: i

THe Seconp Diwan.
(2) Wast-ul-Hayat.

The second collection of Khusrau’s poem, named by him ‘ Wastul-
Hayat ’? (the Middle of Life), was made by the poet in his thirty-second
year,’ and consists of a preface, fifty-eight qasidas, eight tarji‘s, several
fragments and quatrains, making a total of 8,441 verses (abyat) altogether.

~The preface, written in the same style as that of the Tuhfat-us-
Sighar, is quite long and supplies a few more details about the poet’s
career. ,

We learn from it that the poet had now established his position
among the poets of Delhi and that with the advance of years his poetry
had acquired maturity and richness. ‘The time’, he says, ‘for the
ascendancy of witty compositions and elegant writings is no doubt
the middle of our lives and the sweet youth. If a writer’s fiery nature
does not light a blazing torch in the world during the night of youth,
no bright picture is left on the page of time from his pen after his death.’
He goes on to say that it was only at the age of thirty-two that his
poetic genius was fully developed for the poetry of very young people

:.~ 1 The birds were apparently cocks, for Khusrau calls them ‘nar’ ( y )-
Me, 40 (fol. 47), 1.0., MS. 1,187, and No. 41 in B.M., MS. 25,807.

Aécording to Khusrau the diwan contains poems written between the nine-
(the 1.0., MS. has 12th) and twenty-fourth years of his age. But he says
at he was thirty-two when he wrote the preface and there are poems in
Mon written certainly after the age of 24. No. 35 (f. 104) was written in

is unripe and imperfect, howsoever intense their passion for it and how-
soever great their talents. The poetry of old age is weak, lacking the
fire and the vivid imagination of youth, and thus while youth wants
maturity and perfection of technique old age lacks passion and imagina-
tion. Hence it is the middle age that is best suited for the production.
of poetry of the highest order.

This collection, too, he made at the persistent requests of his friends
who, having preserved carefully his verses, odes and mathnawis, handed
them over to the poet to be arranged in their present form. The poet
has supplied this diwin also with the introductory verses! (abyat-i-
silsila) and has made use of certain other new artifices in the poems
contained in it.”

Among the qasidas are Hukmul-Hikam (No. 6, f. 736), ‘Alam-ul-
‘Ilm (No. 7, f. 796); Azhar-ul-anw&r (No. 31, f. 996) and Mirwahatur-
rih (No. 35, f. 1046), while the tarji‘at contain ‘Ain-ul-Ma‘ani Riyat-ul-
Hila} and Hadiqat-ul-hadiqat. Most of the qasidas are in praise of the
martyr Prince, Mohammad Qaan.* Other qasidas are in praise of God,
the Prophet, Nizaémuddin Auliya, Balban, Kaliqobid, Bughra Khan,
Ikbtiyéruddin Kishli Khan, Shamsuddin Dabir, Tajuddin Alp bin Azhdar,
Jaliluddin Firiz Khalji,* etc. The Hukm-ul-Hikam describes the
catastrophe at Multan® and the poet’s own captivity, while the

2 One of these is the peculiar form of ‘Takballus’ called Hamil-i-Mauqif.
For example, he quotes the following lines (qasida, No. 58; f. 122b, 1.0. MS., 1,187) :

Among the tarji‘s, Nog, 6, 7 and 8 are elegies on the death of Prince
Mubammad,* Nos. 1, 2 and 3 are-addressed to the same prince, No. 4
is a fine poem written on the accession of Kaiqobiid ° and No. 5 is
addressed to Kishli-Khan.‘

The tarji‘s are followed by forty-two fragments of varying lengths
and on diverse topics, some being addressed to contemporary persons
of rank. The last fragment gives the number of the verses in the
diwan.®

Khusrau in this diwain, as in the Tuhfatus-Sighar, has followed
close in the footsteps of Khaqini and we must look in the diwan of
that master for the prototypes of several of Khusrau’s qasides. The
elegie:'.too, beautiful and distinctive as they are, have also their inspira-
tion from Khaqant’s elegies, but Khusrau has given them a pathos and
a local colour that mark them as entirely his own. At the time Khusrau
wrote the poems in this diwan, another Persian master, Kamal of Ispahan,
had come into great prominence. This poet, essentially a panegyrist,
has been called the ‘Creator of Ideas’ on account of his subtle and
highly artistic style, so that according to Daulat Shah one could grasp
his meaning only after a second or third perusal of his verses.”

Khusrau, like other poets of his time, also ‘tried his hand at the
new style and soon’ acquired a great proficiency in it. We have already
seen how he recited.one of his quatrains in that style before Maulana
Mush‘iruddin? and how. that great scholar praised and admired his
skill. ' :
Kamil, then, is the other poet whom Khusrau kas followed in this
' diwin, and we can trace a similarity between the poems of the two
masters. :

We have already translated portions of two of the fine elegies
written by the poet on the death of Prince Muhammad. Here are a
few lines more from another. ,

‘Omy heart! Put up with grief, for happiness has disappeared, and
thou O Sorrow! take the world for Pleasure has left the earth’.....
The Eye and the Lamp of the king of the world is gone ; the champion
and bulwark of the Indian empire is no longer there! Where is the
right arm of that Treasure of the Kingdom and the Faith! Where alas
is the Prince of the whole world..... O Saki, away with the wine, for
it has lost its old flavour! O Minstrel, stop that music, for the lute
lacks its former ring of pleasure. Throw the wine on dust for the time
of joy is over, and smash the cup on stone as the days of drinking are
gone! Alas! who shall now reply the enemy on the day of battle, when
the sharp tongue of the sword is gone? Khusrau! how long this tale
of woe? The night is approaching its end and the Khan has gone to
sleep. Draw the cover on that moon-like face and tear open the lining
of the black cap.®

‘A month has passed and he goes not out to play chaugan. His
sword does not glitter in the fray, and his charger does not run in the
cavalcade. He laughs not like the rose in the garden and he shows not
-his face like the moon from the balcony. The nadims® sit with books in
their hands; why does he not manage the state-affairs as of yore? It is
the new year’s day, why is his assembly not decorated like the Garden
of Paradise to celebrate it ? Oh, would that this night of sorrow were
over, and the sun that has just set had risen up again! Would that the
infidel had received from the swords of the ghazis what the ghazis received

that I saw them race like the wind by the side of the golden umbrella!
Where are all the armour-bearers ?* I wish I could see them bringing
the princely sword with its golden belt, and shout, “Be joyous, the
Prince arrives in Multan!” Alas! it is only the dust of Malik Muhammad
Sultan that arrives ! ’

The diwin Wastul Hayat is rather rare and is not found in several
copies of the Kulliyat.‘

Tae THIRD Diwin?
(3) Ghurrat-ul-Kamal.

Ghurrat-ul-Kamil (the Prime of Perfection), the third and in several
respects the most important of Khusrau’s five diwdns, was collected
and arranged by the poet in the year 693 H., and, in its first form,
contained poems composed between 685 H. and 693 4. or from the
age of thirty-four to that of forty-three years.5 The poet was encouraged
and helped in the task by his friends, notably ‘Alauddin ‘Ali Shah,
the scribe, Maulana Shihabuddin and Tajuddin Zahid. The diwan has
been, like the two preceding ones, supplied with the abyat-i-silsila (intro-
ductory verses) and a preface which is very full® and gives briefly the
outlines of the poet’s biography.’ It contains, moreover, some very
interesting discussions about the merits of poetry, the superiority of
Persian poetry over Arabic poetry, the excellence of the language and
verse of ia, the different kinds and classes of poetry, and the various
methods of acquiring mastery over r this art. The poet also speaks of
his own accomplishments and of some new ideas and artifices, introduced
by him into poetry.

' Speaking of Arabic and Persian verse he advances the following
arguments to show the superiority of the latter :

1 Khusrau is very candid in acknowledging the reverse suffered by the Indian
army.

2 Guards. See Sarjandar (supra). j

3 Silahdars. ! if

4 All the references, unless otherwise stated, are from the I.0. MS. 1187.

5 That the poet added subsequently later poems to the diwan is se
from its contents and also from what he says in the Dib&chsw: ‘From the yeas
685, when I was 34 years of age, to the year 693 when I have become 43 4
positions collected by the Scribes have been inserted in this volume a

i Persian poetry is more shythmeti and balanced. Zibit, ‘ete.,
“spoil the beauty of Arabic verse.
' 9. The fact that Arabic possesses such a vast vocabulary find
words of multiple senses while few words in Persian have more
than one sense, and yet the Persian poetry has reached to such a high
pitch of excellence, is sufficient to show the superiority of this poetry
over Arabic poetry.

3. Arabic poetry requires only the ‘ qiifiya’ while the Persian has
both qgafiya and radif.

He says of Indian scholars :

‘ Again, the scholars of India, especially those who live in Delhi,
are superior in poetic talent to men of good taste found anywhere else
in the world, The Arab, the Khurasani, the Turk, the Hindu or others
who come to various cities of India in the possession of the Mohammadans
like Delhi, Multan or Lakhnauti, not to speak of Gujrat, Malwa or
Deogir, which are still the demonaic abodes of the Hindus, cannot change
their tongue even if they spend their whole lives here, and shall always

compose after the fashion of their own country ..... But a writer who
has been brought up in the cities of India, especially Delhi, can, without
actual contact or intercourse with any part r people, write verse

after the manner of that people—nay, ‘can ever mould their prose and
poetry to his own requirements * and can write successfully in the style of
any country he goes to. It has been proved by experience that several
of our men, without even visiting Arabia, have acquired an eloquence
in Arabic which was denied even to great Arab masters..... I have
seen many a Tazik and Turk, who learnt Turkish in India by education
and study and spoke it so eloquently that pure Turks coming from
Khorasin were astonished.* .

Similarly, the Persian language, although, of course, its original
home was Persia, has lost its purity of idiom everywhere except in
M&waréun-nahr, the language of that country being like that of India.
The. Khurasint, for instance, says chi for chih, while some say kaji for
kuja, although they write the words properly ..... But the Persian
in India from the river Sind to the sea-shore® is one and in-
, When we possess such uniformity of idiom, it is but natural
petry is great. This Persian of ours is, moreover, the original

ersian.* The Hindui tongue, no doubt, varies. greatly in

ow that the Turks in India had already become strangers to

161.

idiom in different parts of the country, but Persian is the same throughout
its length and breadth, and it is pronounced as it is written. It is not
like the tongue of the people of Azerbaijan, who say ‘‘kardakun” for
karda, or like that of the Sistanis who always conclude their words with
“sin”, e.g. karda-i-sin, gufta-i-sin. Yet, when some of the Balais came here
—and they were learned and scholarly persons, not boors—the Persian
writers of Delhi adopted their speech in order to mock them, and wrote
so well in that style that they could not criticise or find fault with their
writing.’

The Diwan has got more than ninety qasidas and tarji‘s, about |
nine mathnawis, numerous fragments and quatrains. The. qasidas
contain some of the finest specimens of Khusrau’s poetry that have
acquired a well-deserved fame. Several of them have been written as
replicas to famous poems hy older masters like Anwari, Khagqani, Zahir
of Faryib and Kamal of Ispahan, but there are many more which are
original. ,

Among the qasidhs are: (1) Jannat-un-najat, written in imitation
of Sandi and contaTthing the praise of God, the poet’s conception of Him
and his ideas about religious boliefs and practices, written at the age of
forty-one in 6Q2 H.; (2) Mir’dt-us-Safa, a very well-known poem, being
a replica to KBaqini’s ‘Shiniyya’.! The poem written in a didactic
strain is a very long one and was composed in 695 H. when the poet
was almost forty-five. The main theme is the praise of the Prophet.
(3) Darya-i-abrar, another very famous poem, that excited the praise
and jealousy of his contemporaries and successors, has for its main theme
the eulogy of the saint Nizimuddin Auliya,? (4)‘ Nazm-ud-Durar, another
poem in a marked didactic strain. Other qasidas are mostly panegyrics

a

1 Poem rhyming in ‘shin’. Khaqint’s poem contains 24 verses while the
Mir’tus-Safa of Khusrau has 150 verses. Other imitations of the poem are:
Jilé-ur-Rih, by Jami (180 verses), Anfs-ul-Qalb by Fudili of Baghdad (134 verses)
and Umman-ul-Jawahir by ‘Urfi (94 verses). (See Hajji Khalifa IV, 510.)

2 See Nawii’s Majalis-un-Nafais (Trans. by M. Belin. Journal Asiatique XVII,
1861, p. 329 seq.), where the author says how he praised the poem in the presence
of Jami, how Jami composed his famous poem, Lujjat-ul-Asrar in reply to it and
how Nawai himself composed another imitation, Bahr-ul-Afkar. According to
Nawai, Khusrau said : ‘Si par tels evenements quelconques mes oeuvres venaient
a etre totalement perdues sauf cette qacide, je ne m’en inquieterais guere, car
yuiconque la lira saura apprecier ma valeur et mon talent dans la republique des
ettres.” Khusrau’s, Jami’s and Nawai’s poems open respectively as follows :

addressed to Jaliluddin Firiz Khalji, to his sons, Arkalik Khan and
Ibréhim Qadar Khan, to ‘Alauddin Khalji and his brother, Almas Beg,
Ulugh Khan, to Ikbtiyaruddin ‘Ali bin Aybek (Hatam Khan), and to
some other contemporary nobles.

The tarji‘s contain a very fine poem, written in imitation of a poem
of Khaqini, containing the praise of the Prophet, a panegyric named
Nir-un-Nir addressed to Jalaluddin Khalji, another addressed to
‘Alauddin Khbalji on the birth of a son, describing the decoration of
Delhi on the auspicious occasion, an elegy on the death of Prince Mahmid
Kh&n-i-Khanan, eldest son of Firiz Khalji, and another on the death of
the poet’s own son, Muhammad.

The mathnawis include Miftéh-ul-futiih (which has often been
considered as a separate work but which certainly belongs to the
Ghurratul Kamal as evidenced by the ‘ bait-i-silsila’ that precedes it),
a long letter addressed to Tajuddin Zahid, written in 676 H. from Oudh,
comprising 263 verses ; the Faras Namah a very humorous and interesting
poem addressed to Amir ‘Ali Sarjandar (Hatam Khan) describing the
plight of a horse given by that noble to the poet and requesting the
gift of another; short poems descriptive of the splendour of certain
princely structures and a very small but original sonnet addressed to
a fan.

The fragments, as usual, are of various lengths and treat of very
diverse topics. The fragments are followed by rubé‘is (quatrains), and
then comes a collection of ghazals. The qasiid in the Ghurra are some
of ‘the finest poems of Khusrau and display an elegance, a flow and a
charm that is really wonderful. His imitations of the older masters
have in some cases excelled the originals in sheer grandeur and pathos
and have equalled them in artistic phraseology, while some of the original
poems are among the best specimens of Persian poetry.

Here are a few lines from one of the qasidas in praise of Jalaluddin
Firtiz Khalji, after Zahir of Faryab?:

‘ The loved one’s sweet, honeyed mouth
That bliss to life doth give, oy .
To life-less ones from its sweet font 2" ~ OI a
The nectar rich doth give.
Lo! Here am I but one of those
Who pine away from her !
Sure, ’tis the lot of every one
Whom she false hopes doth give.
Long ages pass, but never doth
She think of her poor friends
I wish the kindly Lord to her
A softer heart may give !
What cares she in her regal pomp,
In her swift, bright career
If there be one who from afar
Doth watch—his life doth give ?
My heart is lost—I grope for it
In darkness in her alley ;
Is there a soul of this lost one
A clue to me can give ?
O Gard’ner ’ware the fiery sighs
The nightingale shall breathe !
Let not that fair rose its sweet scent
To morning breezes give !
My heart doth bleed with jealousy
Of that impudent cup,
For see how every moment she
A kiss to it doth give !
Lo ! E’en the Saki doth conspire
To rob me of my life !
Dead-drunk am I, and evermore
Fresh goblets he doth give !

Lost am I now, nor can revive
E’en if with her fair hands
‘She pours the wine for me and with
A gracious smile doth give !
A thousand times my mouth I wash
With purest nectar rare
Ere may my mouth an humble kiss
On the kingly stirrup give
The mighty king, Jaliluddin,
To whom the lofty heaven
Its seven chairs as ladders for
The lofty throne doth give—
Firiiz, the glorious king, whose fame
From East ta West spreading.
Each moment to all living things
New hopes of peace doth give !

The ‘ Faras-Namah ’ is a fairly long mathnawi, written in an easy —
flowing style. Some portions of it are extremely interesting, and display a
keen sense of humour in the poet. I give below a translation of part of it.

‘O horse-giver, listen—listen for a moment to the tale of the horse
and the grief of Khusrau! When once in your generosity you bestowed
horses on all that be, and so many stables, like ropes of pearls, were
scattered, I pulled up courage and took away one of the pearls from the
populous stables. Yes, I took a pearl, but not born of nacre, amber-
coloured yet not amber. Nay, not a pearl but a sky-exploring cloud,
that eclipsed the pearls of the sky,—a Tartar horse of sweet temper ; a.
Turkish steed, unique in all Hind..... Hot in career like the sun,
swift in flight as the desert wind..... His feet flew in air like birds and
his shoes shone like the crescent moon in mid-air.....

Although I captured that demon, I was myself afraid of its malign
influence. I recited and blew all the incantations I knew, but I fled
from him and he from himself. But at last I got on to his back after a
good deal of coaxing and wheedling—pale with fear like a dried-up leaf
on an autumn twig—and drove him ever so gently. My hands and
feet trembled as doth a rose swaying in the breeze, and I sat on his

‘back a picture of helplessness—like a piece of bone on the back of the
Phosnix,? dreading fall every moment and preparing myself for death.
As I went through the streets, he jumped from house to house, trampling
on every horse he: met on a the,» way, "4 thus like a flying bird I reached
. back my home... wae

1 Bones are considered to be the favourite dood. of the fabulous bird Humiy.

‘The poet then describes how this lively and spirited horse grew
thin and weak for want of nourishment, and proceeds :

_ ‘I tried my best to restore him to his former vigour, but it was no
use : on the other hand, I also became ill. When, however, I got a.little
stronger I went to enquire about him, and said to him: “O my hardy
steed that wast like fire and water ere this, what is it that ails thee,
so that thou hast become like the autumn rose? Thou wast a bird,
but hast become a nest: thou wast a horse and hast become a whip.
Every joint of thy body appears like a reed and I, the rider of the reed,
must look like a madman. I am not a child to ride a reed-horse: I
should consign such a reed to fire. How dost thou fare now? Tell
me without hesitation or fear.’’’

The horse in great indignation replies that it is starvation that has
brought him to this miserable condition and requests the poet to write
his former master from him, telling him of his plight and asking him
to take him back. The letter runs as follows:

‘This is my tale: I break the scal, and display the unseen image
to the commander of the world, the expert, royal rider of the horse of
bounty. With due humility and earnestness the poor Tartar horse
relates his grievous story standing in the row of shoes. You, in your
royal favour and kindness, were pleased to bestow me upon Khusrau,
and. he took me to his house, where I saw a stable, vile and rotten. There
are in it a few scabby horse-lings, their backs bare of skin and their heads
devoid of hair. Their ribs look like the teeth of a comb, and they are
thin as hair..... For want of fodder they have become blind and
feeble and are tried to pegs that will be their graves. On account of
their intense craving for fodder, grass has grown on their bellies. They
chew wood like sugar and suck reeds like the sugar-cane..... I watch
every night the galaxy and strive to pick grain from the moon.....
for ever since I left your abode my stomach was never filled with grass.

‘O Knight and Chief, and O Master! O mighty Lion and furious
Dragon! In your patronising kindness you gave me to your slave, for
you, who provide comfort for the whole world, are always kind and
generous. But why were you so angry with me that you gave me away
and took no pity? You gave me away in generosity, have mercy on
me..... I know you are too generous to take back what you have
given, but take me away from this deceitful tyrant (Khusrau) and give
him some other horge. Give him another horse and give him what the
horse may eat, for otherwise that horse would never come out alive
from his house. Give him not a horse without fodder if you want it

not to die of starvation like me ; let it not suffer what I have suffered
at his hands. Behold! I am already at death’s door and can hear the
sounds of the other world. I go to empty the granaries of Paradise of
their.oats and hay. I have stood up only to fall, and have opened my
heart to lay down my life, for how can I live in this plight /—may you
live happily for a hundred years and may the horse of desire be under
your saddle! God grant my prayer, Amen!’

That Khusrau, in spite of what he says in the dibacha, did ultimately
attach a number of ghazals to this diwan is clear from two of the ‘ abyat-
i-silsila’ that were evidently meant to top the collection of ghazals.’
The book opens with poems in praise of God and the Prophet, and
contains a large number of lyrics arranged in alphabetical order.

The number of quatrains is also very large, and some of them are
in the Shahr-Ashib style—a novel feature in Khusrau’s works.? They
are addressed to young and handsome pliers of different crafts and
trades—a fisherman, the son of a tavern-keeper, that of a weaver, of
a money-changer, a tailor, and so on. One of the quatrains is of special
interest, being a rare example in verse of the artifice ‘ Double-tongued ’
(oll 33 ), wherein the concluding words can be interpreted both in
Persian as well as Hindi without spoiling the meaning of the whole.
It runs as follows: ‘I saw a Hindu youth sweet as sugar from head to
foot and the sight filled me with wonder. I asked him to tell me what
the down on his face was, and he cried out ‘ mori bapa ’.8

Khalji. Apparently the poet, when he compiled and edited the Ghurra,
never thought that he would be able to produce a fourth diwin and so
intended to attach all subsequent compositions to that collection.! But
his poetry grew, as it were, in spite of himself. His genius, the poetic
mind, grew younger and more vigorous with the advance of ege. He
says himself in the preface :

‘My mind..... grows greedier of poesy every day. At the age
of thirty-two, when I composed one quatrain, I had to think and ponder
before I could produce another. But now when I am sixty-four and the
pearls of my teeth are about to fall, my mind tells me that this is the
proper time to let pearls of poesy drop from my mouth. The harder

Often do I plunge into seas? unfathomed even by the perfect masters,
and. without any great trouble bring out so many bright pearls that 1
can hardly gather them. But as the days for decorating and ornament-
ing verses are now past, I pick up only one or two that are worth picking
up and string them together while the rest lie on the surface ® of my
mind, soiled and neglected, for if I were to collect all the fine pearls,
there would have been not four diwans but four oceans... ..

‘I improvise so swiftly that ere one can utter the name of ‘ bait’
I finish a verse, and even the quick imagination cannot overtake my
improvisations for many a quatrain have I completed ere I had time
to imagine or think. By the right of my pen, very often the flowing
pen of the swift and agile Scribe has failed to attain the quickness of
my composition and in the assemblies of kings mostly I have been content
to extemporise and to dispense with the services of the pen..... 4

No wonder, then, that the poet was tempted to add a fourth diwin
to the three already existing. He started on the old plan, wrote a pre-
face, and the introductory verses, and made a collection of qagaid,
tarji‘s, fragments, quatrains and some short mathnawis. But the
preface was written in a new style which Khusrau had recently evolved
and in which passages of varying lengths are composed with analogies
drawn from different things and topics.®

The preface begins, as usual, with the praise of God, and the eulogy
of the Prophet followed by an encomium on his Sheikb, Nizémuddin
Auliya. Then comes a passage of self-laudation characteristic of a man

1 See supra. ;

2 Buhir, which, of course, means both seas and metres.

3 Literally on the ‘ clay (tin) of my mind’.

5 Khusrau first employed this style in the composition of Khaziin-ul-futth,
though he had explained it in the I‘jaz-i-Khusrpwi. We shall speak more about
it in connection with the former work.

who is sure of his powers and knows that his claim to superiority is
unchallenged. ‘The slave, Khusrau’, he says, ‘by the grace of the
kingdom-bestowing God, is unique and peerless in the realm of poetry.
Every quatrain of his strikes the five-fold ‘‘naubat”’! on the drum of
the nine skies and the Khatti? lance of his pen, which has a sky-
scraping flag of fine verses, has risen to the azure canopy of heavim.
His royal coins, each of which is perfect and bright like the full moon,
have become current from city to city or rather, like the silvery disc
of the sun, have caught the East and the West..... The far-sighted
wise ones know well that in his writings there are prose and poetry of
such high order as would not acknowledge the superiority of anything
except the Koran, the traditions of the Prophet and the sayings of the

religious scholars ..... Every “‘ tauhid”’* written by him is a ray from
““God is the Light of the skies and the earth” *; every “na‘t” is a
reflection of ‘‘ yasin”’..... 76

He then goes on to describe the four orders of poetry which he
likens to the four elements, i.e. earth, water, air and fire, and of which
the one resembling fire, he says, is the noblest and most sublime. . Then
he compares his four diwans to four skies and gives his ideas as to how a
diwan should be arranged and what it should contain.® He then again
speaks of his prowess in the field of poetry but winds up, in curious
contrast, with a note of dismay, despondency and regret. ‘Inthe criminal
pursuit ’, he says, ‘of black and white,’ my beard, once black, has turned
white and my white face has become black, and yet like foolish children
I sleep content with the thought that my ghazals keep the young and
the old awake.® My condition is like that of a child who is sent to school
to learn wisdom, but who runs instead to the childish sport of reed-
riding, and so remains a pedestrian * for the whole of his life. I believe
thvt the proper use of the pen is to employ it in religious sciences and
its flight to any other field is a mere child’s frolic. I, the child in old
ago, have made the reed I call a pen run into the deserts of misguidance

and know not which of the wildernesses of hell it shall ultimately take
me to. Whenever this painful thought crosses my mind, a flame runs
through my body. The only hope of this black record of mine being
wiped out lies in the belief that Forgiveness is the cloud of mercy and
Kindness the font of connivance, so that if a down-pour comes from that
cloud and a splash arrives from that fountain, my black record as well
as myself of the black deeds shall be washed perfectly clean. Else what
I deserve is that that record be tied to my neck and with blackened
face I be paraded far and near and then consigned to dreary hell so
that both the record and myself be consumed entirely.’

The contents of the diwan, as the poet says himself in a fragment,
are sixty-three qasidas, six tarji‘s, one hundred and sixty-five couplets.
of mathnawis, two hundred fragments, five hundred and seventy ghazals,
and three hundred and sixty quatrains.)

The qasidas are mostly in praise of ‘Alauddin Khalji,? a few are
addressed to Qutbuddin® Mubarak Shah, while another few are en-
comiums on some of the contemporary nobles, like Almas-beg Ullugh
Khan, Tajuddin Dabir, Hamiduddin, Nasiruddin ‘Arid, etc. Some of
these poems are evidently imitations of older masters,‘ but most of them
are original in style and are perfect specimens of Khusrau’s highest art.
Among them are two poems, one written in the month of Ramadan®
and the other on the occasion of the ‘Id, and nothing can excel them in
the quaintness of analogies, the beauty of imageries and the smoothness.

‘It is ‘Id, and the Saki has poured the purified ruby into the cup
to provide a sherbet for the thirsty fasters.. Wine is the antidote for
the sick, nay it is liquid life or dissolved sun put into the beaker. Wine
is the fountain of life, nay it is the flowing stream of life’s blood which
conceals in itself the ‘‘ma‘jin”’ of revivification..... In front of their
houses sit the great men with wine and musicians, the wine coursing
through their delicate bodies like life. The wine cooled like ice is fire
quenched with water’ ..... There are also scents, sweet as musk and
heaps of roses and tulips and on all sides there are trays of delicious
fruits and sweets, while a hundred kinds of syrups and drinks flavoured
with musk and camphor have been prepared. Every one reclines in a
‘cool spot, a fine garment on the body, fresh as a cloud and light as a
rose-petal. The delicate-bodied fair ones have no tlothes and their
bodies are smeared with sandal, the coo] sandal imparting them freshness
and life ’?

Of the six tarji‘s, three are addressed to ‘Alauddin Khalji, one is
an elegy on the death of that monarch,? another is in praise of his brother, '
Almas Beg and the sixth is another elegy written on the death of
Nasiruddin Mahmid. The mathnawis contain a poem addressed to
‘Alauddin Khalji on the occasion of Khidr Khan’s marriage, while in
another addressed to the same king the poet complains of the neglect
shown to him and requests for royal favour.

The ghazals begin with a ‘hamd’ and occupy almost 417 folios.
Here is a translation of the opening poem *: (

‘O Thou beyond our fancy’s flight,
How can our senge Thee comprehend ?
How can our halting human wit
To Thy great being’s heights ascend ?

1 The poem was evidently written in the early period of ‘Aléuddin’s reign
when wine was still an unforbidden luxury. .

3 Khusrau is evidently referring to handsome youths rather than to fair women.

Be as the dust on Thy threshold,
How can the dust of base concern
Thine noble garb of light enfold ?

How can¢he wingless bird of thought

Before Thy kingly unconcern,

E’en on the river’s bank do thirst
And thirsty unto death remain !

From yon fair, heavenly garden where
The Holy Ghost e’en scarce may dwell
How can our faultful sense receive
A fragrant, life-inspiring smell ?
Oft doth Thy kingly presence grace
The earthly throne of human hearts,
Yet how that presence could be felt
Through these benighted human arts ?

Thine royal mercy’s sign perceive

Some blessed ones to Mecca bound,
Yet pagan Khusrau naught beholds

But idols, idols all around !
Ay, let the spear of Thy disdain

Fall on a worthless slave like me !
Thine gifts in boundless measure rain

On those that Thy good servants be !}

The fifth and the last collection of Khusrau’s poems was made by
him about the close of his life after the death of Ghiyathuddin Tughlaq

Shih and the accession to the throne of his son Muhammad Tughlaq.
It is preceded by a very short introduction consisting of the praise of
God and the Prophet and a eulogy of Nizémuddin Auliya written in a
highly ornate style, but making no ‘reference to the collection itself.
In fact even the name Nihayat-ul-Kamal is not mentioned and there
are no introductory verses. The British Museum MS.' of the work
contains twenty-two qasidas, five tarji‘s, four short mathnawis, a number
of fragments and a collection of ghazals.

The first qasida is in praise of God, the second in praise of the
Prophet and his companions, the third named Nabit-un-Na‘t is a eulogy
of Nizimuddin Auliya, while the following five, four of which are named
Khas Ash‘ar, Rah-i-Rihai, ‘Urf-ul-‘Irfin and ‘Ain-ul-‘Ibar respectively
are long poems in a moralizing tone, outlining the proper significance of
love, the ideals of virtuous conduct, the pitfalls in the life of a man and
so on. The rest of the qasidas are panegyrics on Qutbuddin Mubarak
Shah, his successor Ghiyéthuddin Tughlaq Shah and the latter’s sons,
Mohd. Tughlaq Shah, Prince Bahrim, Prince Ibrahim and some of
the great men of the time. Tyo of these poems are especially interesting.
One of them, named Sahifatul Ausaf, addressed to Mohd. Tughlaq des-
oribes the charms of Deogir,? while the other addressed to Syed Tajuddin
is a long and vehement protest against a charge of disrespectfulness to-
wards the Prophet’s family levelled against the poet by his opponents.®
The fact that the poem is addressed to a Syed and is full of urgent and
earnest appeal would suggest that the poet was in real trouble as a result
of this presumably false accusation. He says:

‘They have alleged that in the writings of this slave‘ there is a
verse or two which may be construed to be defamatory to the Prophet’s
family ..... A suspicion there may be, no doubt, but it is not a
certainty.’ Why should a believer like me be persecuted for a mere
suspicion ?’ He then swears by God, by the Prophet, the apostles, the
Koran, the noble muhAjirs and ansar,® the prayer-carpet of his Sheikh
and by all the saints that he had never intentionally uttered a word
likely to wound the feelings of the Prophet’s descendants. ‘ And if’,
he continues, ‘I have, inadvertently, been guilty of an impudence, well
God alone is free from error’. He concludes with profuse excuses
and asks forgiveness of God and man.

_ Of the taraji‘s, one is an elegy on the death of Qutbuddin Mubarak
Shah, two are panegyrics on Ulugh Khan, Prince Juné (afterwards
Mohd. Tughlaq), another is addressed to the same new king and describes
the splendours of his coronation, while the fifth is a touching elegy on
the death of his own son Haji who died of a painful disease.

The first mathnawi is a condolatory letter addressed to Tajuddin
who appears to have lost his son, his mother and a brother during a
short space of time. The second is addressed to Qutbuddin, the third
to Ghiyaéthuddin on the completion of the Tughlaqdbad citadel,
while the fourth is a reply to a letter of Tajuddin Sipaidhar son of
Shamsuddin.

The mathnawis are followed by fragments some of which are in-
teresting conundrums or riddles, a novel feature not found in other |
works.| He says, for instance, of a razor: ‘ What is that body held by
two substances, animal and vegetable,’ split in two and again joined
together, its belly rent and a tongue in the belly, which performs the
magival operation of converting an old man into a youth in a moment,
and plunders sometimes musk, sometimes camphor and sometimes musk
and camphor together ..... 2?

The ghazals appear to be not entirely a new collection but simply
a selection from those attached to the previous diwans with the addition
of some new ones, two or three of which consist of alternate verses in
Arabic and Persian. A number of quatrains follow, the last of which
runs thus :

‘My misdeeds have ruined me, O God, what shall I do ?

The dark tresses of the beloved have blackened my face, what
shall I do ?

I hope Thou wilt forgive all my sins, but with the shame that Thou
hast seen my sins, what shall I do ?’

In this diwan, too, there are some qasidas written in imitation of
other poets, but, as he says in one of them, Khusrau wrote them simply
to satisfy the curiosity of his friends who probably wanted to test the
poet’s prowess and to see how he replied to the famous poems of the
famous masters.” ,

« (6) Qirdn-us-Sa‘dain.
(‘The Conjunction of the two Auspicious Stars ’.)

Qirdin-us-Sa‘dain, the first long poem in mathnawi. form composed
by Khusrau, was written, as we have seen above, at the request of
Kaiqobad after the poet’s return from Oudh where he had stayed with
Khan-i-Jahan, the governor of Oudh, for two years. The poet complete
it in Ramadan 688 u., at the age of thirty-six, after hard labour of three
months and was handsomely rewarded by the king for it.! Later on,
when he was almost forty, Khusrau added another section to the poem
to serve the purpose of both an introduction as well as a conclusion.
He tells us in it that the number of the verses in the poem is 3944 and
that as he had not counted them formerly the result had been a decrease
in the number at the hands of careless scribes and so he thought it well
to specify the number definitely.”

The poem, whose main theme is a quarrel between Bughraé Khan,
the son of Balban, and Kaiqobad, the son of the former who succeeded
his grandfather to the throne of Delhi, and their meeting and reconciliation
on the bank of the river Sari or Sarji, has been thoroughly analysed
by Cowell in the J.A.S.B. (1860, p. 225 seq.) and translations of some
interesting passages have been made by Elliot (iii, 524 seq.). I.do not,
therefore, intend to go into details here, but shall confine myself to a
general survey of the work.°

Khusrau, as he says himself in the supplementary section referred
to above, had long cherished the ambition of writing a master-piece in
mathnawi form. He had trodden assiduously and with remarkable
success in the foot-prints of the famous qasida writers, and the composers
of ghazals. Mathnawi was still a region unexplored by him. He was
alive to the greatness of this particular art and was fully conscious of
the great genius of its most renowned exponent, Nizimi of Ganja.‘

But he was at the same time conscious of his own adaptable genius and
wanted to match his strength with the old giant, so that when Kaiqobad
requested him to write the story of his meeting with his father, he found
an opportunity of trying his hand at the new game.1 Yet Khusrau’s
love of originality and his contempt of mere plagiarism in thought or
style, urged him to infuse a new spirit into the old art, to seek out for
himself a style both original and striking? He started with industry
and care to piece together a series of descriptive poems into a united
whole. His mathnawi, when it was completed was like a picture com-
posed of figures painted separately and independently and then put
together, with a suitable background, to represent the scene the artist
wanted to depict. It was a difficult task, and it is wonderful that he
has succeeded so well. There may, of course, be here and there, a figure
that is out of place, another that has been too much elaborated. still
another that has been given an unnecessary prominence, but on the
whole, there is such harmony and unity as only a very skilful artist
could impart to the picture.

The theme of the poem was not a very attractive one. An unnatural
quarrel between a father and his son had very little of romance or heroic
glitter in it, and the poet wanted to hide the defect by the wonderful
pen-pictures that abound in the work. He says himself : ‘ As the subject
had little of interest in-it and its skeleton was devoid of life, I was forced
to write descriptions so that I have almost lost sight of the object of
the poem. On its face I painted the mole of artistic affectation, so that
perchance it may appear beautiful ’.?

Khusrau seems to have been criticised by his contemporaries rather
severely on the production of this poem. He himself had, moreover,
grave misgivings about its worth, but any impartial reviewer would

1 Khusrau denies vehemently that he wrote the poem for any monetary reward.
Eternal fame, he avers, was his only motive. (Q.S., p. 181.) He, of course, got @
reward from the king and accepted it ‘for a pearl cannot be thrown back to the
ocean’,

admit that the poem is a fine piece of artistic poetry, as original as it is
vigorous. It is, perhaps, tiresome as a story, but its component parts
are full of charm and interest, and are in some cases of great zsthetic
and historic importance. Such are, for instance, the descriptions of
Delhi, the punishment of the Mongols, the triumphal arches, the singing
girls, the musical instruments, the presents exchanged between Bughra
Khan and Kaiqobid, the dishes on the royal table, and the different
kinds of boats used. ,

The most original feature, however, of the poem is the introduction
of abyat:-i-silsila to serve as headings for the different chapters and of a
number of ghazals each of which echoes the sentiment of the chapter
immediately preceding it and serves to relieve the monotony of the
mathnawi.?

The poem is written in the hexametric sari‘ the metre of the Makb-
zan-ul-Asrar of Nizimi and the Matla‘-ul-Anwar of the poet himself.

The poem has been highly praised by most of the critics and in fact
it is, in some respects at least, the finest mathnawi written by Khusrau.
It was lithographed with a marginal commentary in Lucknow in 1885.
The edition is complete and tolerably correct. A second lithographed
edition was published recently in Aligarh.

Miftaéh-ul-futih,? the second of Khusrau’s historical mathnawis,
was completed by the poet on the 2nd of Jumad IT in the year 690 H.
and describes four victories achieved by Jalaluddin Firiz Khalji within |
the course of one year. The poem, comparatively a small one, forms
as we have already seen, part of the poet’s third diwan, the Ghurrat-ul-
Kamal,® but its length and importance make it pre-eminently an in-
dependent poem and, as such, worth a separate consideration. Yet as
Sir John Elliot has given a full analysis with translations of extracts 4

1 Khusrau was certainly the first poet to introduce true ghazals into a mathnawi
and thus to take away some of the sing-song monotony of the metre. Gibb ascribed
the credit to Sheykbi, but that Turkish poet died in 855 H., 130 years after the
death of Khusrau. (See History of the Ottoman Poetry I, 309-310.) _ ghazals
have been selected from the various diwans of the poet.

and as I have already utilized most of the material contained in the
poem, .I shall confine myself here to a few general remarks.

This poem, like the ‘Ashiqa, is written in the hexametric hazaj
(mahdhif) and like the Qiraén-us-Sa‘dain has its rubrics in verse. The
style is extremely simple and presents a striking contrast to the other
two mathnawis. It is more like the plain, matter-of-fact style of certain
short mathnawis scattered through Khusrau’s diwins. But there are
here and there descriptive passages of quaint charm, beautiful in their
simplicity. Such is, for instance, the description of the rajah’s palace
at Jhain, or the description of the festive arrangements made for the
reception of the king in Delhi on his victorious return from his campaigns.

The poem opens with the praise of God, and the Prophet and a long
panegyric on Firiiz Khalji. It then describes that king’s accession to
the throne on the 3rd of Jumad II, in 689 H. and his successes against
Malik Jhijhii, the rebellious governor of Karra, the rajahs of Oudh, the
Mongols and the rajah of Jhain. The poet narrates the events with
scrupulous exactness. He says himself: ‘ When I began this poem and
prepared my pen to write, I adorned it (with various artifices), for that is
indispensable in writing verse, but when I thought of adding what was
untrue, truth came and held my hand. My mind also did not relish
the idea of mixing lies with truths, for although false exaggerations may
impart charm to a poem, truth is an admirable thing.’

Khusrau concludes the poem with prayers for the king and a hope
that the king would recognize the worth of his service which should
earn for him an eternal fame. He had, he adds, only three things in
mind when he wrote the poem, viz. to show his gratefulness to the
beneficent monarch, to leave behind a lasting relic and, through the
everlasting name of the king, earn an immortality for himself.

The poem is found in most of the manuscripts of Khusrau’s Kulliyat.

(8) The ‘Ashiga.
(The Story of Khidr Khan and Dewal-rani.)

The ‘Ashiga or ‘Ishqiyya, as it is sometimes called,’ forms the
third book of the series of. historical mathnawis composed by Khusrau.

2 Elliot (iii, 548) gives, in his translation, another passage after this conclusion
containing the praises of ‘Alauddin Khalji. That passage has nothing to do
with this poem, but forms part of a separate poem.

Shahi) as the poet says: ,

Gt ote olathe dla 3) S alae

The poem of which the central theme is the romantic love and the tragic
fate of Khidr Khan and the beautiful princess Devaldi, was finished by
the poet in the month of Dhulq‘ad 715 a.,1/but later on, in the reign of
Ghiyéthuddin Tughlaq another chapter was added to it. The poet
had first brought the story to a close with the happy marriage of Khidr
Khan to Devaldi. When, however, the prince had been slain by his
merciless brother Mubarak Shih who in his turn-had succumbed to the
treacherous sword of his Parwar favourite Khusrau Khan, Khusrau
took up the narrative again and finished it, by the addition of 319 lines
to the former 4,200, with the description of ‘Aliuddin’s illness, his
estrangement from his son, the latter’s confinement in the fortress of
Gwaliyar, Kafir’s treachery in blinding him, Mubarak Shah’s unkind
and monstrous demand,’ and the final murder of the unfortunate prince
together with his brothers Shadi Khan and Farid Khan.

The poem is altogether different in style and spirit from the Qiran-us-
Sa‘dain. The poet had in the latter to make an epic out of a silly
incident and had to call to his aid all the various artifices of the Persian
verse to give it a touch of the picturesque, the romantic and the heroic.
His style in it is, consequently, elegant but affected, picturesque but
elaborate. In the ‘Ashiqa, the poet found a much more congenial
and promising subject to try his skill on. It was, moreover, as a labour
of love that Khusrau undertook to write the romance. The unhappy
prince had a charming personality. He was brave, handsome and
generous, a great patron of letters and a disciple of the saint Nizamuddin
Auliya. Khusrau had, naturally enough, the utmost esteem and affection
for this accomplished prince, so that when he was one day called to his
presence and the prince gave him a rough draft of the story of his love
for the Rajput princess requesting him to turn it into verse, Khusrau
started the work with eager industry.2 He had already written the
five mathnawis of the Khamsa and had consequently acquired(a pro-
ficiency and skill in writing this form of verse such as, has rarely been
equalled. } Yet it took him a little more than four months to complete
the poem,* a fact which shows how patiently and with what loving care
Khusrau wrote it.

1 ‘Ashiqa (1.0. MS., 1215, f. 158).

® Khusrau mentions no date of this addition but it was certainly made after
the death of Mubarak Shah, as the poet could not conceivably have called him
cruel ( +2 ) in his lifetime.

The metre selected by the poet for this mathnawi is the hexametric
hazaj (mahdhif)* that is continued throughout the poem without any
variations. There are no rubrics in verse and although there are
numerous passages of amatory verse (ghazal) they are not in the true
lyric style.

The poem opens, as usual, with the praise of God, who is
aptly described in this case as the Creator of Beauty and Love,®
that of the Prophet and the saint Nizémuddin. This is followed by a,
panegyric on ‘Alauddin Khalji, whom the poet gives bits of advice with |
a candour and a courage truly astonishing, warning him against the evil
consequences of tyranny, injustice and indulgence in wine. The poct
then turns to the country of Hindustan, describes briefly its conquest
by the Mohammadans, gives short, but wonderfully accurate and valuable
pen-sketches of the kings that had reigned before the time of ‘Alauddin ;
and praises the language of India. He then sings of the calm and
prosperity, peace and unity of belief® prevailing in India during the
reign of ‘Alauddin, mentions his successes against the Mongols, and his
conquests in the south of India. Then the real story commences with
the conquest of Gujarat by Ulugh Khan and the capture of Kanwladi,
her longing for her daughter Dewaldi, the expedition sent by the king
to bring that princess, her arrival in the royal palace and the commence-
ment of Khidr Khan’s love for her. The story is well-known and can
be told in a few words.

According to Khusrau the princess loved Khidr Khan as intensely
as he loved her and the two confided their secret to certain confidants
who helped them to communicate with and see each other frequently.
The mother of the prince, however, disapproved of their love and per-
suaded the king to send Devaldi to a different residence in the Red
Palace. She at the same time arranged Khidr Khan’s marriage with
her brother Alp Khan’s daughter and the marriage was duly celebrated
in spite of the disinclination of the prince. Khidr Khan, however, could
not forget Devaldi and pined for her, so that his mother alarmed at his

grief at last consented to his marriage with his beloved, and the two
lovers were happily united.

When ‘Alauddin fell ill, Kafr as we have seen above, managed to
exile Khidr Khan to Gwaliyar where his sole solace and comfort was the
sweet company of his faithful wife, Devaldi. Nothing could excel the
tender devotion with which she nurséd her husband when the tyrant
Kfar blinded him, and her grief and sorrow for his sad plight was un-
bounded. When, after the assassination of Kafir, Mubarak Shah as-
cended the throne of Delhi, he soon managed to get hold of a base
excuse to end the life of Khidr Khan—the latter’s refusal to hand over
to him his wife Devaldi. The prince fell beneath the sword of a
monstrous slave to be wept and mourned by his aged mother and his
devoted wife and was buried in a tower in the fortress! Khusrau is
silent as to the fate of Devaldi. Elliot’s translation of the narrative
here is quite misleading and his conclusion that Devaldi was wounded
while other Jadies of the harem were slaughtered is utterly wrong. The
poet says nothing of the sort. Khusrau, as usual, concludes with verses
in which he moralizes on the affairs of the world and speaks wistfully of
his own life spent in the pursuit of poetry.

The romance is unique in Persian literature in more than one respect
In the first, place it has for its theme a contemporary event, all the
characters in it are real persons whom the poet knew familiarly, and he
had seen with his own eyes all the incidents he describes. The story,
secondly, belongs to the domain of history, not mythology which latter
was the favourite subject of the former writers, and yet it has all the
charm, all the romance and all the piquancy of the older stories. The
facts of history narrated with great fidelity have been woven round
with such a rich mass of fresh fancies and variegated imagery that the
whole forms a peerless specimen of the masterpieces of romantic litera-
ture. The'entire poem, thirdly, breathes of patriotism, the artist’s love
for the land of his birth. It is fragrant with the smell of the kewra,
the karna, the champak and the hundreds of sweet Indian flowers and
spices, and is luminous with the bright Indian sun and the pale, cool,
moonlight. The poet sprinkles here and there words of Indian origin
that blend beautifully with Persian and give to the poem a distinction
and a peculiar elegance.? “It is itself like the Indian beauties who, as

Khusrau says, are not like the pink and white beauties of Khallukb
and Yaghmi, having colour without sweetness, cold as a block of ice,
but have grace and elegance, warmth and charm.)

Fourthly, the small tales with which the poet illustrates his
points are original and instructive and at the same time very
interesting. Throughout the poem there are passages of beautiful verse, '
full of pathos, of love, of passion and wistful longing that can scarcely
be matched even from the pages of Nizami’s famous Khamsa\ and the
poet shows a knowledge of the working of human hearts, the mysterious
ways of young persons in love, and the jealous care of parents, that is
really astonishing. My only regret is that there is no space here to give
a few specimens from the poem.? Elliot has translated most of the
passages that are of historical importance, although, like all other of his
translations, they are often very incorrect.

(9) The Nuh Sipihr.

(The Nine Skies.)

Nuh Sipihr, the fourth historical mathnawi by Khusrau, wa
completed in the month of Jumad I, 718 H., when the poet was almost 67
years of age, and celebrates the glories of Mubarak Shah Khalji’s reign.
The poem is divided into nine parts of unequal lengths each being named
a ‘sipihr’ peculiar to one of the nine heavenly bodies, headed by an
introductory verse and concluded by a ghazal. It contains 4,509
hemistiches.*

The poem opens with the praise of God and the Prophet, a descrip-
tion of the latter’s mi‘raj or ascension and a long eulogy of Nizimuddin
Auliya wherein the poet emphasizes the necessity of a religious and
spiritual guide for every novice setting forth on the path of virtue and

In fact the poet says that Khidr Khan’s draft of the story contained many
Hindui words and phrases which he omitted in the poem as they would not have
gone well with Persian.

1 ‘Ashiga.

2 See, for instance, the passage where Devaldi comforts herself by the thought
that she is still young and beautiful ; that descriptive of her grief when the prince
was blinded (f. 139, MS. No. 1215); that where the first meeting of the lovers is
described and so on.

8 Cf, Elliot, iii, 566, and Shibli, II, p. 141. Both of them give the age as 65.
But as the poem was written in 718 and Khusrau was born in 651, the correct figure
is 67. He says himself, moreover, that he was nearer seventy than sixty when he

Sipihr I.—This is followed by a panegyric on Mubarak Shih and a
description of the incident that occasioned the composition of the
mathnawi.2 Then follows a description of the king’s ascension to the
throne on the 24th of Muharram 716 u., and the favourable positions of
the stars at that auspicious moment.? The poet then turns to the first
campaign of Mubarak Shah against Raghi, the rebellious and pretentious
minister of Rai Ram of Deogir, and concludes the first sipihr with the
return of. Khusrau Khan to the royal camp. The metre of this sipihr is
the octametric mutaqarib (mahdhif).*

Sipihr II.—The second sipihr opens with an account of Mubarak
Shah’s buildings, the completion of the New Palace constructed by his
father, ‘Alauddin, and the erection of a large congregational mosque.
There follows a long and detailed description of Khusrau Khan’s campaign
against Tilang and Warrangal, his victories and his triumphal entry
into Delhi after the successful termination of the campaign.6 The
mosque was now completed and a lofty pillar of polished red stone was
attached to it.”? The poet then sings the praises of Delhi, declares its
superiority to Baghdad, Cairo, Khorasan, Tirmidh Tabriz, Sipahan,
Bukhara, and Khwarizm and concludes with a few verses of Saqi Namah
and a ghazal. The sipihr is written in a running and pleasant metre,
the octametric mutaq@rib (salim), an unusual one for a mathnawi.®

The Third Sipihr is, perhaps, the most interesting of the nine. It
consists almost entirely of the praises of India and contains valuable bits
of information about its climate, its flowers, its birds and other animals,
its sciences, religions and languages. The poet has taken pains to prove
India’s superiority to Khorasan and is very enthusiastic about the land

of his birth. ‘ Why ’, says he, ‘some may ask me, all this preference for
India? It is because India is the land of my birth and training and
also because its ruler is a mighty king like Mubarak Shah.’ Yet a
little moved, perhaps, by the general trend of his compatriots’ affection
for the lands of their origin, Persia and Turkestan, he offers the following
excuse for lavishing all this wealth of poetic imagery on India : ‘ What
praise can there be for what has already been so highly praised? Does
a houri need the services of a tire-woman? Praise is an art only when
by means of it you turn the jarring noise of a caravan bell into a melody
of the organ.’! The metre of the sipihr, again, is a very difficult and
uncommon one. In fact, as he claims himself, no poet had written
mathnawi in that metre before his time, and as far as I am aware none
has written since. It is the hexametric matwi form of the rajaz, that
imparts a peculiar earnestness and charm to the verse.”

Khusrau first starts to give seven arguments to prove that India is
Paradise, and shows its superiority to other countries in point of climate,
flowers and fruits. He then shows the superiority of Indians in science
and wisdom over all other nations. ‘I know’, he says, ‘that in this
land lie concealed wisdom and ideas beyond compute. Grcece has been
famous for its philosophy, but India is not devoid of it. All branches of
philosophy, if one examines carefully, are found here. Logic, astrology,
kalém *—in fact every science, except “‘faqr”* is found .. .Physics,
mathematics, astronomy, divination of the past and the future are

known..... In divinity (or metaphysics oly) alone the Hindus are
confused, but, then, so are all the other peoples. Though they do not
believe in our religion, many of their beliefs are like ours. They believe,
for instance, in the unity and eternity of God, His power to create after
nothingness, etc., and so are better than the Dualists or those who
believe in Father and Son, the anthropomorphists, the Sabians,° the
materialists® or the Mushabbih.’? They worship, no doubt, stones,

‘beasts, plants and the sun, but they recognize that these things are
ereations of God and adore them simply because their forefathers did
so.’ He then gives ten instances of the Indians’ superiority. (1)
Knowledge and learning are common and widespread among them.
(2) They can apeak all the languages of the world clearly. (3) Learned
men from all parts of the world have come fromime to time to study
in India, while no Brahmin has ever travelled to any place outside India.
Abii Ma‘shar, the famous astronomer,! for example, came to India and
learnt his science for ten years at Benares. (4) The science of ‘ hindsa ’
ond the numerical system originated in India. Hindsa was undoubtedly
invented by a Brahmin named As, whence Hind-dsi shortened into
Hindasa.2 (5) The wonderful book of wisdom Kalila and Damna
(Panja Tantara) was composed in India. The book has been translated
into Persian, Turki, Tazi (Arabic) and Dari... (6) The game of chess
is an invention of India. (7) Chess and the Damna, both of Indian
origin, have become popular with all other nations. (8) Indian music,
the fire that burns heart and soul, is superior to the music of any other
country. Foreigners, even after a stay of thirty or forty years in
India, cannot play a single Indian tune correctly. (9) Indian music
charms not only men but beasts also. Deer have been hypnotised and
hunted simply by music. (10) Finally there is in no other land an
-enchanter, a wizard in poetry like Khusrau, albeit an humble admirer
of the king.

Khusrau then makes some very interesting observations about the
languages of India. He-says that he knows several languages. Of
these Arabic has a well-formulated grammar. Turkish also has a
grammar written chiefly for the benefit of officials for no one ever learns
Turkish, Rimi, or Dari for the acquirement of knowledge. In Persian,
no one has yet formulated a grammatical system, and he himself would
have done so but for the fact that this would be a thankless job, for
every one knows Persian well and does not require to study its grammar.
Three languages are very important, viz. (1) Arabic, although it is a
hard language and even a clever man finds it difficult to acquire pro-
ficiency in it. (2) The Persian of Persia, ‘eloquently sweet with the
flavour of Shiraz’. (3) Turkish Persian, i.e. Qiniqly, Oighir, and Ghuzz
‘that originated in Qipchiq and Yamak and spread in other lands ‘ gaining
lustre like the moon’. After a féw remarks about the spread and
intermixture of languages, he turns to India, where, he says, the language

2 The derivation is interesting. By ‘Hindasa’, Khusrau epparently méans
Srithmetic and not geometry which is more correctly rendered by ‘ Handasa ’.

literary Janguage. .

originally was Hindii.1 With the advent of the Ghiris and the Turks
who spoke Persian that language was learnt by all and sundry. All
languages have some peculiar merit and charm, although, of course,
Arabic, being the language of the Koran, holds a unique position. ‘Now
in India every province has a peculiar idiom for the expression of various
thoughts. There is Sindhi, Lahori, Kashmiri, Kabari,? Dhur-Samundri,®
Tilangi, Gujari, Ma‘bari, Gouri, Bengali, and Oudhi, but in Delhi and
all around in its suburbs the language is the same Hindii that has been
current here for all forms of speech since olden times.‘ Then there is
another language, used exclusively by Brahmins, unknown to the
multitude and named Sanskrit since ancient days. It is known only to
Brahmins and even all Brahmins have not a full knowledge of this
(difficult) tongue,> for it has strange forms of grammatical irregularities
in its orthography, syntax and literature.6 They have four religious
books which serve as the guiding principle for all their actions.”? These
are called “‘ Bids” and contain stories of gods, although like the ‘‘ bid” ®
they bear no fruit, All other stories and romances of theirs, their
books, letters and documents that require elegance of diction and display
of skill, are written and construed in this language by the Brahmins
and other cultured scholars. This language, pure as a pearl, is inferior
to Arabic but is superior to Dari.’ (I.0. MS., 1187, f. 718.)

Some curious accounts of Indian animals and their sagacity follow this.
There are the talking birds, like the parrot and the magpie (sharak),
other birds whose cries betoken events, the crow for instance, about
whose speech several volumes have been written; the peacock, the
wonderful bird which does not pair in the natural way, a fluid from the
eye of the male swallowed by the female being sufficient for fertilization,'
and other birds who have been trained to perform wondrous tricks,
horses trotting to music, goats performing balancing feats, the extremely
manlike monkey and the elephant so sagaciously human in its. ways.
The poet says about the lore of birds’ and animals’ speech: ‘I had
learnt the science to such an extent that I could understand birds and
beasts. I had also experienced how the gods tell us news about one
through them. In fact I saw such mysteries that if I were to explain
them I shall cram two volumes. But as this lore is banned by the
Prophet’s religion, I closed my ears to those evil talks.’

He then gives some instances of magic and sorcery as practised in
India, and concludes: ‘ All this is sorcery and as such, unreal and
eerie,? but there is one thing of which you cannot deny the reality—
the dying of Hindus out of devotion either with sword or with fire, a
woman dying willingly for her dead (husband) and a man for an idol or
a rich man. This is, no doubt, forbidden in Islam, but behold what
a noble thing it is! If the law permitted it, many a blessed one would
die eagerly like that...

The sipihr concludes with an account of the defeat and capture of
Harpal-deo and the festivities on the triumphal return of the royal
armies from Arangal.

The Fourth Sipihr, written in hexametric ramal (mahdhif),* is
consecrated to Jupiter. It opens with a beautiful description of a

admirers. See (Majalis-ul-Nafais of Nawai J.A., 1861, 329) how Jami and Nawai

of its improbability by a timely incident.

morning when Iqbal (Fortune) visits the poet and exhorts him to write
advices for his friends. He starts to do so, and with his characteristic
frankness, addresses the king, the heir-apparent, the maliks and other
officials, the soldiers and the civilians. The sipihr ends with a ghazal.

The Fifth Sipihr is consecrated to Bahrim, the hunter of the sky
and is composed in the hexametric khafif (makbban and mahdhif).*
Beginning with a glowing encomium on India’s winter, the sipihr describes
a hunting trip of the king and contains a highly artistic dialogue between
the royal bow and arrow which beginning in mutual compliments ends
in a hot and vituperative quarrel that is ultimately stopped by the
chief armour-bearer ? of the king. A Saqi Namah, followed by a ghazal,
ends the sipihr.

In the Sixth Sipihr, dedicated to the sun, the poet employs the
hexametric hazaj (maqsir or mahdhif) ® and describes very picturesquely
the birth of Prince Muhammad, the son of Mubarak Shah on Thursday,
the 23rd of Rabi‘ I, 718 ., and his early training, and prophesies great
things for the august baby. A rather long Siqi Namah and a ghazal
bring the sipihr to a close.

The Seventh Sipthr, composed in the hexametric ramal (maqsir) *
is ascribed to Venus and so the poet aptly enough mentions in it the
splendours of spring and the new year’s day, the festivities on the birth
of Prince Muhammad, the gorgeous arches and pavilions with paintings
in bright colours, the beautiful dancing girls, Persian and Indian,® the
‘jashan’ attended by all the nobles of the realm, and wine and musical
instruments.

In the Eighth Sipihr, the poet employs the hexametric hazaj
{akhrab, maqbad and mahdhif).’? The sipihr dedicated to the planet

Mercury, is a rather tiresome but instructive account of the game of -
chaugin as. played by the king and contains a dialogue between the |
stick and the ball, the latter posing as a lover. Some passages of the
dialogue are tenderly passionate and are reminiscent of similar passages
in the Majniin-o-Leyl&. The sipihr concludes with a Siéqi Namah and
a ghazal.

The last and the Ninth ‘Sipihr, consecrated to the moon, is in. the
hexametric ramal (makhbin and mahdgbif).1 The moon, Bays the
poet, is so near the earth, that he may rise up to it and remove her
rust with the brightness of his poetry. He then describes a visit paid
him by Mercury and how that planet acknowledged his superiority. He
then.speaks of the excellence of poetry and boasts of the high rank
achieved by the poets of India of that age.2 Of himself particularly he
‘says: ‘The proof (of the excellence of my verse) is this that only an
attractive poetry can catch the imagination of the world like the sun
and the moon. For as it is good, the multitude as well as the elite are
rapt in its enjoyment. One copies a ghazal, another memorizes it and a
third solaces himself with it in his griefs..... In the present age amongst
the Persians only two poets of note have appeared: Sa‘di and Humaim,
both of whom are perfect adepts in ghazal writing. But if you look for
other branches of poetry you will find that their qagaéid*® are what they
are* and I need hardly speak of other forms. My own poetry, however,
is not bad. If there were any other nightingale in those countries, the
world would have known of it. But as there is none, their roses do
not smell. When we have thus disposed of the poets of Persia, let us
drink to the glory of Delhi and this flowing magic!’® The poet con-
cludes with excuses to the king for the faults in the poem, and thanks
God for having spared him to complete it.© He gives here also the date
of the composition and the number of verses in the poem.

of India’* gives in it some of the sweetest melodies that ever flowed
from his lyre. The prospect of a high reward and more than that the
thought that this was probably the last great poem he would live to
write goaded the pdet to do his best. He does actually pour out in it
the pearls preserved in ‘the bony casket replete with many a divine
secret’. The poem is full of a glow of satisfaction, a pride for the
land of his birth, the glory of its monarch, and the triumph of his own
genius. He handles historical facts like poetic fancies and knits them
together with such fidelity, such skill and such perfect blending that an
epic looks like a romance. The ghazals, written specially for the poem,
are fine lyrics. The innovation of splitting the poem into several parts
with different metres is an extremely happy idea. It serves to impart
freshness and distinction to each part, and so although one may admit,
perhaps, that the various parts of the poem look disconnected and
independent, it would be cruel to describe the poem as ‘a formless
assortment of miscellaneous odds and ends, a painfully elaborate doxo-
logy..... 78

The poem, in fact, is replete with things of immense historical and
sociological interest and may safely be claimed to be a composition
unique, in style and spirit, in the whole range of mathnawi literature—a
poem which would amply repay a careful study and would be appre:
ciated much better after a thorough perusal.

The poem has never been published, but manuscripts exist in several
libraries.‘ _
(10) The Tughlaq Namah. brSh

Khusrau, according to several reliable authorities, wrote a fifth
historical mathnawi, detailing the events of the short reign of Ghiya-
thuddin Tughlagq Shih.’ The poet, as we know, lived to see the death
of that monarch and the coronation of his son and heir Muhammad
Tughlaq, and so it is very likely that he did commence to write a history
of Tughlaq Shah’s reign to complete the series—to compose one more
masterpiece before death sealed for ever the lips which old age and

vicissitudes of life had failed to keep back from singing. But unfor-
tunately the poem has apparently been lost to the world. That the
poem was left incomplete is clear from what has been said about
Emperor Jahangir ordering Hayati, a poet of his court, to complete it,
although it is not known whether Hayati actually performed the by no
means easy task.

A copy of the mathnawi was supposed to be in possession of a -
gentleman in Delhi, but has evidently disappeared. The latest rumour
is that it has found its way to Hyderabad.}

The loss of the Tughlaq Namah is great not so much from a, historical
point of view as from the literary standpoint. Tughlaq Shah’s reign
was too brief to be of any great importance, but the poem, the last of
the great master’s compositions, would have provided another valuable
specimen of the rich and matured verse of Khusrau’s old age.

C. Tue Kuamsa.

In his later career Khusrau started to write a replica to Nizami’s
Khamea ® that had caught the fancy of all the contemporary poets and
scholars, and had acquired an extraordinary fame in the eastern lands.
The old master, taking for his model the Shah Namah and the Yasuf-o-
Zuleykha of Firdausi, had produced these five poems with such industry
and care and had enriched them with such wealth of original conceits,
quaint similes and metaphors, picturesque and melodious phrases and
vigorous expressions as had rendered it one of the most valuable con-
tributions to Persian poetry, and it was, consequently, not an easy task
for even a poet of Khusrau’s genius to reply to it successfully. In
fact, Khusrau was fully conscious of the stupendousness of the task and
had grave misgivings about his own capabilities, yet his fiery nature
refused to acknowledge defeat, and his love of versatility goaded him to
tread the tortuous path, cleared by Nizaémi but untrodden by any other

1 See Appendix.

2*All the five poems were dedicated separately to ‘Alauddin. There is no
evidence, however, to show that the work was undertaken at that king’s behest.
The poet presented a complete manuscript of the Khamsa to Iftikharuddin, the
prime minister (Sadr 5.0 ) who, however, does not seem to have been very prompt
in rewarding his labours, for Khusrau complains of this in a fragment. Baqiya,
1.0. MS., 1187, £. 3910.

since his time. That Khusrau undertook the task at the instance of the
king or any of his nobles, we have no reasons to assume.! He was simply
moved by the fame of the Khamaa to produce himself something that
may acquire an equal renown in generations yet unborn and seems to
have regretted that the idea did not occur to him when he was younger
and his muse more vigorous. ‘When first the diamond of my speech
was sharp I knew not the pearl and pierced only shells, and now when
T can know a ruby from a pebble, my bright mind has become dull.’ 2

But to a modern critic it would seem to be very fortunate that
he did not think.of this earlier—that he devoted his time and energy
in the prime of his youth to producing something which is much more
valuable than the romantic tales of the old times: Nizimi had told
them well enough. It was fortunate again that Khusrau did not spend
much of his time on what after all was a thankless job. He, perhaps,
later on realized the comparative futility of his attempt and, getting
tired of the monotonous mathnawi verse hurried through the task as
soon as possible.2 He was, moreover, severely criticized by his jealous
contemporaries who scoffed at the ambitious idea and described his
productions as ‘ a stew cooked in Nizami’s pot and a foolish self-conceit: ’.4
His self-confidence and just pride in the vigour of his genius, however,
helped him along and sometimes even carried him away to vainglorious
boasting. ‘The star of my poetry’, he sang, ‘has arisen high and has
made Nizami tremble in his grave ’.®

Yet in his sober moments Khusrau could not but recognize the
superiority of Nizimi. ‘With this alphabet’, he says, ‘which may
amuse children, I have written an imitation of the great master’s work.

1 ‘Alauddin Khalji was too indifferent to letters to make such a request.

If it is not sweet, there is music in it, if there is no life in it, there is -
a skeleton... From his birth-place Ganja he scattered out the five
treasures, and with those five I want to match my own strength...
so that the wise ones may say of me: “Bravo! thou worthy pupit of
Nizimi”.’ ‘The verse of Nizimi’, he says elsewhere, ‘is like a pear] in
.its purity and the whole world is full of the pearls scattered by him ’.!

This superiority, nevertheless, Khusrau ascribes to the fact that
Nizimi wrote practically nothing beside the Khamsa in his whole life
and his circumstances permitted him to devote all his time and energy
to its perfection? One would hardly concur with those of Khusrau’s
critics who described his Khamsa as trash, or on the other hand with
such enthusiasts as have clainfed that a single verse in it outweighs in
merit the whole Khamsa of Nizémi.* More sensible critics like Jami
and Nawai in the old days and Shibli in modern times have judged
Khusrau’s replica rightly : it is, as they say, the best imitation of Nizimi’s
work, but considered as a whole, it falls short of the original. Yet,
when we say an imitation we refer only to its form, for as we shall see
later on, Khusrau has not abandoned his originality even in the Khamsa.
He adheres scrupulously to the metres used by Nizimi and is faithful
to the broad outlines of the romances, yet he takes considerable liberty
with the smaller details and, what is more, is never guilty of plagiarism.
There are, moreover, parts of his Khamsa which are as fine—if not
finer—than any found in that of Nizimi, and Khusrau often shows
himself to be a greater artist in the grouping and delineation of events.
Tt is only in the wealth of beautiful similes and metaphors as well as
in polished and elegant phrasedlogy that Nizimi excels his imitator,
and the fame that the first poem of Khusrau’s Khamsa, the Matla‘-ul-
anwar acquired both in India and Transoxiana was due as much to its
intrinsic merit as to the long-established prestige of its composer,
although the poem was completed in the incredibly short space of a
fortnight’s time.‘

After this brief introduction, we proceed to examine the five poems
separately, beginning with the Matla‘-ul-anwar.

(11) Matla‘-ul-anw dr.

This poem was completed by Khusrau in the year -698 H. in
a fortnight} and is a reply to Nizami’s Makhzan-ul-asrar. \ t is written
in the same metre as its prototype ? and deals with practically the same
themes. The whole poem has been divided into 20 chapters each com-
prising 125 couplets and ending in a story illustrative of its subject.
The total number of verses including the introduction and the prologue
is, as Khusrau says himself, three thousand three hundred and ten.

The poem opens with the praise of God, followed by three mundajats,
three na‘ts, panegyrics on Nizémuddin Auliya and ‘Alauddin Khalji
and a prologue giving the motif of the poem and describing the ecstatic
experiences of the poet during a night and a morning and his turning with
reluctant steps from the ‘ garden of reality ’ to the guidance of his teacher?
The poet explains that he proposes to talk of three things in the poem,
namely, the Law, the Path and the Truth, and shows in the first magdla
the superiority of man over all other creations, his ability to rise to
immeasurable heights through proper discipline and training, and the
reality and nobility of the mission that has been entrusted to him in
this world. The second magdla deals with the necessity and advantage
of knowledge, the dangers of ignorance and the discrimination between
true scholars and such ‘turbaned’ hypocrites as have made their
learning a means of worldly intrigue and consider it to be ‘a talisman
for capturing the affections of kings ’.‘

The third magdla speaks of the virtues of speech and how best to
utilize this gift. Truth and sincerity ere essentials of speech.

In the fourth magdla the poet speaks of the Unity of God and the
five great principles (arkan) of Islam, ie. the kalma-i-shahidat, the
prayers, the zakat, the fast of Ramaday and the pilgrimage to Mecca,
and lays special stress on devotion and faith as distinct from formal
observance of religious rites. Piety, the great struggle against Self,
purging the mind of carnal desires, etc. form the theme of the fifth

magala.

The sixth magdla outlines the path of virtue and sufism, advises
to seek the society of saintly persons, warns against hypocritical teachers,
and condemns the use of wine as a means to attaining spiritual ecstasy.

The seventh magala speaks of the virtues.of contentment and self-
reliance and the futility of worldly ambitions.

Love, true and false, its importance in the lives of men, its dangers
and hardships, the ways of the fair ones, and the purity of love form
the subject of the eighth magdla which is one of the most interesting of
the 20 chapters.

The ninth magdala deals with friendship and friends, the true friend-
ship, its essentials, its importance and its conditions.

In the tenth magdla the poet explains our duties towards our relatives,
our parents and children.

The eleventh magala extols the importance of generosity and charity
and of their proper use.

The twelfth magdla consists of advices to soldiers and warriors,
the virtues of courage and patience and of lenience and mercy to fallen
foes.

The thirteenth magdla contains some very frank and interesting
bits of advice for kings and princes.

The fourteenth magdla deals with honesty and dishonesty both
in private as well as public life. The poet is especially bitter against
hypocritical scholars and dishonest officials.?

In the fifteenth magala the poet praises mercy, gentleness and patience
and condemns anger, cruelty and injustice to our inferiors.

The sixteenth magdla cont&ins general maxims of morality and
worldly conduct, while in the seventeenth magdla the poet speaks of youth
and old age which he, in a very picturesque passage, compares to spring
and autumn respectively, advjges young men to make the best of their
youthful days and to keep virtuous and straight, and counsels old persons
to recognize the infirmities of old age and to renounce the practices of
youth,

In the eighteenth magdla Khusrau deals with the transitoriness of
life and the ‘treachery of the sky’, the old age, and the necessity for

1 This is rather interesting. Wine and other drugs were apparently used even
in those days in India by some of the ‘ spirituals’.

2 Curiously enough Khusrau here warns the king against employing Hindus in
large numbers. ‘(God forbid that the king’s realm be again in the clutches of the
black Hindus. Numerous crows are a nuisance in a garden: it is better that there
be but one mole on the cheek than that there be a thousand. ’

a really able and pious preceptor. The subject is continued in the
nineteenth magdla which concludes in a very touching lament for his
loneliness and the absence of friends. ‘We also,’ he says, ‘had some
one—a friend and a companion. Not a weed is now left of that garden.
Why seek for the inmates ? The very dwellings are no more !.... Those
dead ones find not alas! the permission to come back from their distant
abode! I die in longing for them—would that I were really dead and
with them !’ .

The twentieth and the last maqifla is devoted to women. It consists
of advices to his daughter Maimiinah and to women in general. The
poet speaks rather sceptically of the loyalty of women, advises them
to observe the purdah, tells them the way to domestic peace and amity
and winds up with a tirade against women of loose character.

In the epilogue the poet speaks proudly of his work, condemns
such jealous persons as shut their eyes to ‘the splendour of this moon-
like idol’ and see only its defects. He acknowledges his debt to other
poets and gives, as we have already seen, the date of composing the poem
and the numbers of verses in it. Khusrau’s example led many of his
successors to compose similar imitations of the Makbzan-ul-asrar. The
“most notable of these is Jami’s Tuhfat-ul-ahrar.

A lengthy list of these poems is given in the Haft Asman.®

The poem was lithographed in Lucknow in 1884 a.p., and later
in Aligarh. Manuscript copies, along with the other four poems of the
Khamsa are numerous and are found in most of the libraries.

(12) Shirin-o-Khusrau.

Shirin-o-Khusrau, the second poem of his Khamsa and corresponding
to Khusraw-o-Shirin of Nizimi was completed by the poet in the beginning
of Rajab 698 Hu. It is composed in tge same metre as its model * and
has four thousand one hundred and twenty-four couplets. It differs
considerably, in details, from Nizami’s poem.

The work opens, as usual, with ‘hamd’ and n‘at, the praise of
Nizamuddin Auliya, and an encomium on ‘Alauddin Khalji to whom
the poem is dedicated. The poet then talks of the mysteries of the

universe and the importance of love, and begins the story with the
death of. Hurmuz and the accession to throne of Khusrau.’

Khusrau, growing jealous of the power of one of his nobles, Bahrim
Chobina, marched on Madain, but the expedition proving unsuccessful
he returned dejected and weary and his wise minister and companion
Shahpir diverted him on his way telling him, among other wonderful
things, of Shirin, the niece of the queen of Armenia—of her wonderful
beayty and skill in riding and hunting. Khusrau, struck by this narra-
tive paid Shirin a visit and the two fell deeply in love with each other.
Soon after, however, Khusrau, went to Riim where he married Maryam,
the daughter of the Qaisar, with whose help he defeated Bahram, who
had to fly from Madain and seek refuge in Turkestan where he died
shortly afterwards fighting for the Khaqain. Khusrau now ruled in
peace, his people were prosperous and his power increased, so that the
Qaisar growing afraid of him thought it prudent to transfer his treasures
from Asia Minor to Abyssinia. Several boats full of these rich treasures
were launched into the sea but a capricious breeze blew them off to the
coast of Persia where Khusrau took possession of them and distributed
their contents among his grateful subjects? Maryam, neglected
by Khusrau and shocked at the ill-will between him and her father,
declined in health and died. Khusrau, was on the whole glad at her
death for he thought he could now marry Shirin. He paid her a visit
again, but the lovers quarrelled and Khusrau returned to Persia sad and
disappointed. He soon afterwards, however, married Shakar, a famous
beauty of Ispahan. Shirin, meanwhile, met Farhad, who was really
the son of the Emperor of China, but had renounced his heritage and
taken to sculpture and art, and asked him to construct a canal for
bringing in milk from one part of her country to another.® Farhad,
who was smitten with the charms of Shirin started readily on this super-
human task, asking in return nothing but an occasional glance at the
beloved face of Shirin. Khusrau hearing of this, grew very jealous and
paid him a visit trying to persuade him to give up his love for Shirin.‘
Farhad, of course, refused and so Khusrau, by a dirty trick, soon made
him commit suicide. Shirin, in revenge sent an old, wily woman to
Khusrau’s palace and the hag instilling herself into the confidence of
the unwary Shakar soon managed to compass her death through a

Niz&mI makes no mention of this incident.
8 Khusrau’s account of their meeting is more romantic than that of Nizami.

deadly potion which she gave to her as a medicine.’ After these tragic
deaths Khusrau and Shirin remained estranged for some time, but were
ultimately reconciled and married with great pomp and ceremony.
Their happiness was great, but it did not last long, for Shirweh, the son
of Khusrau, encouraged by the easy-going and pleasure- loving nature
of his father conspired with the nobles, besieged the palace and captured
the throne. Khusrau was murdered by a ruffian who bore him a grudge
and the faithful Shicin committed suicide by the corpse of her dead
husband.

This, in brief, is how Khusrau relates the old romance in a highly
artistic style in which he falls hardly short of Nizémi. In some places,
in fact, he proves himself to be a greater dramatist and a more skilful
painter of character than the old master. Only his poem lacks that
perfect finish and polish which repeated retouching and long revision
could alone impart to it. The concluding part, where Khusrau questions
the great philosopher, Buzurg Ummaid about the skies, the stars, the
four elements, etc. is very original and instructive albeit a little dull
and wearying.

The poet finishes the poem with a comparison of himself with Nizami,
gives the date of composition and the number of verses in the poem
and concludes with a prayer to God.

‘When Khusrau parts with this life, forgive him his sins—for the

(13) Majniin-o-Leyld.

Khusrau completed his poem Majnin-o-Leylé in 699 H. The
poem, written after Nizami’s Leyla-o-Majnin, contains 2,660 couplets
and is in the same metre as its model.2, Khusrau, according to himself
has, moreover, tried to imitate in this poem the style of Nizdmi as closely
as possible. ‘I have advanced close in his footsteps as far as I could.
I discarded my own style and adopted his : I wrote after the old model

1 Khusrau’s sketch of her is wonderful. Nizami is silent about Shakar’s fate,
and places the death of Maryam after that of Farhad.

and did away with all affectation, ornamenting my ideas with only
simplicity and flow of language.’! It is, perhaps, too much to say that
Khusrau has succeeded in imitating Nizdmi’s style completely : there is
in his poem still a touch of his original style, but there could be no doubt
that as far as the general quality of the poems is concerned, Khusrau’s
poem is as fine as Nizdmi’s and Khusrau is justified when he says:
‘No one could imitate Nizdmi better than this. If he himself had read
my poem he would not have recognized it from his own, and I see no
difference between them except that one is the product of his mind and
the other of my soul ’.”

The story as told by Khusrau is slightly different from Nizdimi’s
version of it.2 The poem opens with hamd, n‘at and the praises of
Nizgamuddin Auliya and ‘Alauddin Khalji. The poet then says how
Gabriel visited him and exhorted him to be active, not to rest in his
laurels, but try to add yet another glory to his crown. Then follows
some advices to his son whom he calls Khidr. The story itself begins
with the birth of Majniin, his education in a school, where he meets the
charming damsel Leyla and falls in love with her. The poet then
describes how their love becomes common talk and upsets Leyla’s parents
who prevent her from going to school and confine her in ‘ purdah’.
Majnin gets wild and wanders about but his father persuades him to
come back home promising him to get for him the hand of Leyla, which,
however, he fails to do. Naufal, a powerful chieftain, taking pity on
Majniin’s plight fights Leyla’s father to force him to marry her to Majnin
but failing in his undertaking he marries his own daughter, a beautiful
girl, to Majnin. The distracted lover, however, finds little solace in
this marriage and soon flees away to the wilderness again, where he
lives among wild animals. His mother and father pine away in grief
for their beloved son and die one after the other. Leyli, meanwhile,
was as distracted and miserable in her confinement as Majniin. Once

8 According to Nizémi, for instance, Leylé was married to Ibn-i-Salaém and he
makes no mention of Majnin’s marriage to Naufal’s daughter. He introduces also
another romance, the love and marriage of Zéynab and Zaid, which Khusrau has,
wisely I think, ignored altogether.

only, through the kind assistance of some friends the two lovers met
each other in the wilderness. Leyla at last heard a false rumour of
Majniin’s death, fell ill, wasted away and died. Majniin hearing of her
death walked in front of the bier containing her corpse. He laughed
and sang for ‘the time had come when the two would be united in an
inseparable union’. When Leyla’s grave was dug and the coffin placed
in it, Majniin gave one wild cry, leapt into the grave and clasping the
dead body in a close embrace expired immediately... Some of Leyla’s
relatives wanted to remove his body from hers, but then spoke out
some wise ones with tearful eyes: ‘This love had nothing of worldly
desire about it : it was a mystery from the treasure-house of God.....
Happy are they who with a pure heart thus go to death in the path of
faithfulness.’? So the two lovers were allowed ‘to lie for ever together
in one grave, locked in a union that is eternal.

The poet then moralizes on the fickle ways of the world, and in a
very pathetic passage describes his own double loss—the death of his
mother and his younger brother Qutlugh in one year. After a com-
parison, of his own poem with that of Nizami and acknowledging the
greatness of that master he turns to his critics : ‘ If I am devoid of skill,
let us hear you speak so that we may know your worth..... When
your own poetry is ignominious why do you foolishly brag about Nizami ? ,
He gives the date of composition and the numbers of verses in the poem
at the conclusion.

The poem, written in an elegantly simple and tender style, is, I
think, the finest poem of the Khamsa and Khusrau has in it proved
himself to be as great a student of the psychology of love and emotion
as any Persian poet.

The poem has been lithographed several times,’ and MS. copies
exist in many libraries. Several poets have written the old romance,
but the best, after Nizdmi’s, are the poems of Khusrau and that
of Fudili of Baghdad in Turkish,* and the two, curiously enough, show
a good deal of resemblance in certain parts.®

(14) Aina-i-Sikandari.

Aina-i-Sikandari, or more correctly Ainshai-Sikandari,! the fourth
poem of the Khamsa which is an imitation of Nizémi’s Sikandar Namah,
was composed by Khusrau in 699 #., and contains 4,450 couplets? It
is written in the same metre as the Barri and Bahri Sikandar Namahs
and delineates mostly the events narrated in these two mathnawis.®

Beginning with hamd, na‘t, the praises of Niziémuddin Auliya and
the king, the poet goes on to extol the merits of poetry of which, he
boasts, he has a full share. He then mentions the order in which he

“composed the poems of the Khamsa and criticizes the assertion made
by Nizémi that Alexander was a prophet. According to Khusrau he
was only a saintly person (wali). Then follow some advices to his son
called Haji, and the poet gives an abstract of the whole story treated
in the poem.

The tale commences with Alexander’s war against the Khagaén of
China and the capture of the warrior-maid Kanifii whom Alexander
ultimately married.‘ From the east Alexander turned towards the
north and subjugated the Risis and the Almanis, and then went to the
land of Yajij whom he quelled after a grim struggle and whose inroads
into the land of their neighbours were stopped by the construction of a
massive wall, of copper, iron, lead, and stones, under the special super-
vision of Aristotle. ;

Khusrau then mentions the various inventions of Alexander’s
time : the astrolabe,® the looking-glass and tents made of cotton cloth
instead of hide, and describes the construction of the famous Alexander’s
mirror. He then mentions how the Greek philosophers, headed by Plato,®
refused to listen to Alexander’s teachings and how their land was des-
troyed by a flood, so that Plato, who survived the disaster, ultimately

attached himself to the suite of the king. Alexander now starts on &

‘long sea-voyage accompanied by Khidr, Ilyas, and Aristotle and wanders
about in the seas for years. He then descends into the depths of the
sea in a water-tight glass case and guided by an angel sees the great
mysteries of the ocean. He is at last informed of his approaching end,
hurries back to land and dies bequeathing his empire to his son
Iskandariis. The prince, however, was so struck by the vanity of
human, ambition and worldly power that he refused the throne and so
Darghiis, a relative of the late king, is elected ruler of the vast empire.
Khusrau concludes the poem with a long and very well-writton epilogue
in which he speaks of his achievements, laments the passage of timo and
the advent of old age,’ gives the date of the poem and the number of
verses in it, and appeals to his readers to be lenient: in their judgment
,of the merits of the work, and not to ignore its good points. The epilogue
ends in a sentence in Arabic prose.”

KKhusrau has, of course, tried to imitate Nizdmi in the poom, but
he has been less successful here than elsewhere in rising up to the level
of the great master. Khusrau’s heroic passages lack that vigour which
Nizaimi’s have so abundantly, and the whole poem wants unity and
continuity. It is, in spite of some very fine passages, dull and un-
inspiring. ‘*

The poet has changed the story to suit his own purposes and differs
considerably from Nizami in several details and, what is more important,
has altogether left out the conquest of Persia and the death of Darius
wisely, perhaps, for it was well-nigh impossible to tell those events
better than Nizimi has done. (Lithographed in Aligarh.)®

(15) ‘ Hasht Bihisht’.
(The Eight Paradises.)

Hasht Bihisht, the fifth and the last poem of the Khamsa, an
imitation of Nizami’s Haft Paikar, was completed in 701 H., and-contains
3,350-eouplets.4 Its metre is the same as that of its prototype and like

the latter it narrates the romantic life of Bahram-Gir, the old Persian
king famous for his hunting exploits.’ -

The poem, as usual, opens with the praise of God and the Prophet,
a eulogy of Nizaémuddin Auliya and a panegyric on Sultan ‘Aléuddin
Khalji, to whom the poet dedicated the mathnawi. The poet then relates
how on a fine, moon-lit night he sat alone while a thousand poetic fancies
crowded his mind impatient to be clothed in words and how he began
to write this poem and was encouraged in this task by his friend
(‘Aléuddin) ‘Ali (Shah). Then follows a long passage containing in-
teresting bits of advice for his ‘ paradise daughter ’, ‘Afifa. .

The story begins with an account of Bahram’s love for Dilaram, a
beautiful Chinese damsel, who always accompanied the king on his
hunting trips. One day she failed to admire the king’s skill and Bahram
offended at her behaviour exiled her to a forest, where she met a pious
old man, a skilled musician ‘ who had all the four musical instruments
and the twelve melodies at the tips of his fingers’. The old man soon
made Dilaram a wonderful expert in music and she came back incognito
to Bahrim’s domain. There the fame of her skill spread far and wide
for she could charm even the beasts and the birds with her divine
melodies, so that the king too went one day to hear her play. Dilaraém
then disclosed her identity and the two were happily reconciled.*

The courtiers and companions of the king were, however, getting
tired of his ceaseless hunting trips and consequent neglect of state
affairs, and they beseeched his counsellor and vizier, Nu‘man, to devise
some means to keep the king in the capital. The wise old man then
constructed seven wonderful palaces, named each of them after one of
the seven stars, and lodged in it a maiden of exquisite beauty, the daughter
of a king. Bahram soon gave himself up to the pleasures of these
paradise-like palaces and renounced his hunting. He visited each
of them on successive days of the week and the princess in it told him
an entertaining story. Bahram, however, soon after got sick of this life
‘and again started out on another hunting expedition. He saw a very

2 Niz&mi’s version of the manner of their reconciliation is quite different.
' . 8 The princesses came from the ‘seven climes’ (Haft Iqlim). According to
Nigémi Behrim found ‘the portraits of the seven princesses in a locked chamber
in Khawarnaq where he lived with Mundbir of Hira in his childhood, fell in love
with them and procured their hands himself when he became king.

fine onager and set his horse in its pursuit. The onager leapt into
what appeared to be a well but was really a large cavern, deep and
dreadful, and Bahram’s horse leapt after the onager with his rider into
the abyss from which he never came out. His companions and courtiers
waited long and anxiously for him but finding no trace of him, they at
last returned weeping and mourning.

The poet here moralizes on the unstability of worldly goods and the
helplessness of man. He then speaks of the poem, the date of its com-
position, the number of verses it contains and compares it to the Haft
Paikar. ‘This poem is an echo of that old work, and contains all the
wealth which that old treasure has got..... Honey, no doubt, is
valuable but vinegar also has its purchasers: the pearl is costly, yet
amber also possesses some value... and even if there be no real gold
in this poem it has the glitter of gold. A flower-seller likes the garden:
a wood-cutter prefers a forest of thorny trees. The bird of the desert?
that eats stones considers stones more valuable than pearls.’ The
poet concludes with thanks to God-and mentions how his poem was
revised by his friend, the great scholar Shihabuddin.

The bulk of the mathnawi is, of course, formed by the seven stories
told by the seven princesses all of which are apparently original and quite
entertaining.? (The poem was lithographed in Lucknow in 1873 and
later in Aligarh.)

myriads of blossoms and flowers, of wine and its rapturous ‘delights and
‘of music that lifts the soul above the sordid surroundings ofthe earth,
forms undoubtedly the most pleasant and the most precious part of the
poetry of any country. Songs of the great deeds of mighty heroes may
stir our hearts to ambitious action and fill our minds with noble discon:
tent, the praises of glorious monarchs, the tales of their wars and con-
quests may supply material for the speculative brain and the prolific
pen of a historian, but it is the poetry that sings of the eternal and
universal themes, love and life, that consoles and comforts, elevates and
inspires every human heart, and the greatness of a poet depends largely
on how far he succeeds in handling these themes properly.

Persian poetry, such as has come down to us and with which we
are familiar, developed on the lines of Arabic poetry in which lyrics
formed. no independent branch, but constituted. a portion of the qasida.
It was, therefore, natural that the earliest Persian masters, emulating
the Arab bards, devoted their art and talents to qasidas. But the
more versatile and flexible Iranian minds could not long be tied down
to the narrow limitations of their Semetic models and soon found out a
way to vary the monotony of their poetry. The first step taken by the
Persian poets was the introduction of several metres, unknown to the
Arabs, that were certainly much more suited to the spirit and genius
of their poetry and provided a vaster field for the exercise of their art.
The invention of the mathnawi, a form of poetry particularly suitable
for epic and romantic poetry, was the next development, and finally
there came the ghazal that’ was destined. to achieve the largest amount
of popularity in all eastern countries.

Sf Sa‘di, the wizard of Shiraz, “was certainly the first man to advance
the cause of ghazal. His lyrics, soft and refined, musical and melodious
became as popular in the Moslem countries as his Gulistin and Bustan,
and he was soon recognized as the master of lyrics. Yet Sa‘di’s ghazals
lacked something : they had no frenzy, no burning passion, no erotic
love in them. They were tame and gentle, and his successor and
compatriot Hafiz was the first to detect this weakness, and to supply
the ghazal with that ‘ fire’ which has made the name of Hafiz renowned
all over the world.! Yet years before Hafiz was born, Khusrau, ‘ the
Parrot ’ of India, had firmly established the claims of ghazal to superiority
over all other branches of Persian poetry. Both Khusrau and his great

_ 1 Thus H&fiz says: ‘They all recognize Sa‘di as the master of ghazal, yet
-may ghazalé have rather the style and spirit of Khwaji’s ghazals’. Khwajii of
Kirman, a poet not very well known, died in 763 8. See Browne: (Persian Lit.
under the Tartar, pp. 248-339). See also Z.D.M.G., ‘1848, p. 205 sea.

205

contemporary Hasan, took for their model the old master, Sa‘di, and
recognized his greatness, but Khusrau, like Hafiz, was not a blind
follower. -He also saw what Sa‘di’s ghazal lacked and, unconsciously
perhaps, drifted away from the old path and evolved for himself a lyrical
poetry the like of which has been rarely produced by any Persian poet.
It is a pity, however, that he could not free himself entirely from con-.
temporary conventions and ideals and does not seem to have attached
any great value to this poetry. With him, as with Sa‘di, it was a foster-
child though, perhaps, less neglected and more carefully brought up,
and this fact accounts for the presence of a fair amount of what is dull
and insipid, weak and puerile in his lyrical poetry side by side with
poems of the highest order and the most sublime genius. It is idle to
speculate what his verse would have been like if he had concentrated
all his attention and energy on lyrics : perhaps, he could never do that,
or even if he did he could not have improved much upon the best speci-
mens of his ghazal, which are quite numerous—more in fact than those
of doubtful merit so that it is unjust to say that ‘ three-fourths of the
mass is pure hack-work, a useless versification of common-place ideas ’,
or that ‘they are a burden on the shoulders of posterity ’.1 Nor can I
agree with Prof. Habib in his assertion that ‘most of the ghazals were
written not from the fulness of the heart, but the emptiness of the
pocket ’,? although one would readily admit that Khusrau’s collection of
ghazals could have been better for a little judicious pruning.

But the poet had no time, even if he had the inclination, to under-
take a thorough revision and purging of his ghazals. In fact, as far as
we can gather from his own writings, he himself made but two collec-
tions which he appended to his third and fourth diwans. Later collec-
tions were made by Saifi at the instance of Prince Baisunghar,? and by
other enthusiasts, and exist in several manuscripts. They are usually
arranged in alphabetical order, and in some cases contain ghazals said
to have been culled from the various diwans.

It is difficult to define exactly the fine qualities of Khusrau’s lyrics.
Their charm is vague and elusive, subtle and inexpressible. One should
read them in the original to appreciate their true value. Yet a few
suggestions may be made here as to the salient characteristics that
have imparted them a unique dignity.

(1) Khusrau, an expert musician, had naturally a keen ear for
melody and harmony, and his selection both of metres and words is

1 Life and Works, pp. 88-90.
2 Ibid. The learned Professor apparently labours under the delusion that all

the five diwans of Khusrau contain nothing but ghazals and that these ghazals
were composed mostly to please the poet’s patrons.
~ 8 See supra.

such as is best calculated to impart a flow and rhythm to the verse.)
(2) But this effect is produced not at the cost of ideas. His style is
never affected or abstrusively ornate. Most of his ghazats, on the
other hand are written in a wonderfully simple though elegant style,
and the language seems to be that used for ordinary everyday con-
.versation in his time. (3) Ghazal has always been generally considered
to be a collection of couplets in the same metre and with the same
rhyme, yet each a complete unit more or less independent of the rest.
The theme changes with each couplet, so that the poet may, from the
heights of bliss in one couplet, plunge into the depths of deepest despair
in the one immediately after it. Sa‘di, however, first showed the way
to a new style of ghazal wherein the component parts are more sym-
pathetic and homogeneous so that a continuity of theme, so desirable in
a poem, is obtained. But it was left to Khusrau to utilize the new idea
to its fullest possibilities. In his diwans we meet with scores of poems
with verses so well balanced and so nicely strung together as cannot fail
to excite our admiration and wonder. (4) Many of his poems are full
of a fervent love, a fiery passion capable of both exoteric as well as
esoteric interpretation. This, coupled with their peculiar melodiousness,
has made his poems extremely popular with the siifis who listen to them
with rapt attention from the lips of the qawwals to-day as their brethren
did in the poet’s life-time. More than one person have been reported
to have yielded the ghost while listening to a particularly touching
verse.* (5) Yet, at the same time, there are other poems in a gentler and
more restrained vein, which fill our hearts with vague longings. a tender_
joy or a soft melancholy. (6) Still others are boisterously joyful, over-
flowing with the joys of physical life—the fair women, the music, the
wine, the flowers, the pleasant summer rains, the singing birds and the
flowing waters. (7) Lastly, Khusrau’s lyrics have a peculiar finesse
and subtility of ideas that most of the Persian poets lack. In fact,
I think, this was a characteristic that developed in India and, except
Jami in old times and Naziri later on, no other Persian poet can compete

1 I do not agree with Shibli when he says that Khusrau is at his best in short
metres. I think almost ali his fine poems are in more or less long metres. One
of the finest, however, is in a short metre :—

with Khusrau in this particular respect, though there have been several
Urdu poets who can.’ While then one cannot under-rate the value of
his other works, it is certain that the lyrica form the most important
part of Khusrau’s poetry and that his great fame rests more upon their
excellence than on anything else.

In the following translations I have tried to retain as far as possible
the spirit and form of the original poems, and hope that some idea of
their quality may be had even from this defective rendering.

I,
(Jealousy.)

Lo ! comest thou again to me,
Thy graceful body swaying !
Thine eyes are languid, O my Love,
Where hast thou been a-maying? -
Whose love-lorn heart didst gladden thou ?
O faithless one ! be candid !
Where didst thou hide thy moon-like face
As Joseph, in the well did ? -
I rave for thee, but heedless thou—
Where hast thou been a-roaming ?
Whose heart was it that caught new fire
From yon bright cheeks a-flaming ?
Where didst thou quaff the cup last eve
Whom didst thou hand the goblet ?
Whose thirsty lips in darkness did
That life’s own fountain wet ?
Who held thy languid drooping form
Of musk and henna scent
In his fond arms ?—To whose behest
Thy wilful nature bent ?
Who kissed yon lips—whose hands did smooth

’ Those lustrous, raven tresses ?

- Who fondled thee—ah ! say forsooth—
With eager, hot caresses ?
Thy cheek hath lost its rosy hue
Thine eye its wonted glow !
Come, Khusrau, tell me who it was
Her fair face did thee show ! ®

1 I would have liked'to add here the name of Ghalib also, but I regard him
as an Urdu poet essentially. In his Persianpoetry he followed Naziri very closely.

The blood-red tears mine eye-lids lave,
Whose face mine eyes would see ?
A cruel thorn my heart doth pierce,
For whom this longing be ?
The mad-cap heart I with great art

From fickle beauties weaned,

. Is stolen by some one again,
Who, pray, the thief may be ?
In darkness do I roam alone
Each night on dusty paths

Dust on my head, in my

heart a gloom

What may this mad quest be ?

‘ What wilt thou offer if she comes ?’
They say with mockful glee.

Why, don’t they see the thousand pearls

My tearful eyes set free ?

Two snare-ful locks her face adorn,
A rose-hued horse beneath her
A thousand hearts her victims are—

Who may this rider be ?

On hapless Khusrau swift do fall

The arrows from her bow

Why should his blood not drench the sod ?—
What can her scruples be ?!

Down there beneath the cruel earth

How fares that rose ? ah

me !

How-fares that silv’ry moon of mine
In ‘darkness far from me ?

With weeping have mine eyes grown dim
As Jacob’s did of old ;

How fares that lost one, Joseph-like,

In that dark dungeon cold ?

I feel like one whose light is gone

By cruel griefs surrounded, ;

How fares my Love in that vast space
By earthly bounds unbounded ?

E’en like a pearl was that sweet one

To the dust rolled down from mine eyes
Alas ! mine eyes are dark as dust,
Where doth that bright pear! lie ?

Like Khidr’s green garb, the verdure fresh
Springs from that dusty mound,

How fares my loved Font of Life

For regions unknown bound ?

Ah friends, those painful queries cease,
Don’t ask of Khusrau, prey,

How fares his weeping eye just now,
For what can Khusrau say ?!

(An Awakening.)

The tipsy rose woke early in the dawn

And filled the poppy’s cup with sweetest wine,
Here drowsed the jasmin by the rose’s side
There stood alert the cypress straight and fine.
The wind blew soft, the narcissus dosed

Its body swayed, now drooped and now arose,
I in the garden by my friend lay ’wake

My friend—forsooth the moon itself was she,
But soon, alas, my side she left

And grief was all that was left for me.

It is a pity indeed that I have no space here to give a fuller account
of Khusrau’s lyrical poetry, or to quote enough selections to illustrate
its manifold characteristics. It is a poetry both original and vigorous,
refined and artistic, and its popularity in the East has been unbounded.!
Numerous poets, including his contemporary Hasan,? have modelled
their verse on it, and even in Turkey the lyrics of Khusrau were evidently
well known and probably imitated by some of the poets. Sa‘di himself
admired them, and the great Hafiz acknowledged their sweetness.
Naziri, the best ghazal-writer of later times, imitates Khusrau frequently.
and Ghalib is another notable poet whose ghazals smack of the flavour
firat imparted to them by the ‘ Parrot of India ’.

It may be mentioned here that Khusrau has written some ghazals
in Arabic. Their number, however, is so small that we need take no
special notice of them. Any scholar of his time could have produced
Arabic verses of a similar quality. 'Thev are, in fact, as the poet himselt
says, ‘in a Persianized, rudimentary style’, and were composed merely
to shut the mouth of such callous critics as denied him even the simplest
proficiency in the Arabic language. 4)

We may also add here a few words about Khusrau’s quatrains
which are appended to his various diwans.’ Most of them are either
in praise of God, the Prophet, and the kings and nobles, or, like the
ghazals, treat of love and the beloved. But there are a few in a more
philosophical vein that almost remind one of Omar Khayyam. There

1 Thus Jami says in his Baharistén (Henri Massé, 1925, p. 190). ‘Ses ghazals,
grace a des conceptions bien connues qu’amants et amoreux interprétent selon leur
propre goat et leurs propre sentiment. ont été apprciés par tous.’ He mentions
(p. 191) ‘Ismatullah of Bokhara as one of the imitators of Khusrau.

2 Hasan’s poetry is, perhaps, of a simpler and more natural order. It is more
like that of Sa‘di. whence his title of Sa‘di-i-Hind. But one can detect enough of
Khusrau's influence in it.

8 Hafiz says in a ghazal which he sent to Ghiyathuddin of Bengal :

charms of young and fair artisans and craftsmen? These latter may
have formed part of a larger collection, a Shahr-Ashib, which Khusrau.
is reported to have composed.® Here are a few fine specimens.

The popularity of Khusran’s ghazals has been responsible for
numerous and varied collections and selections. Manuscript copies are:
numerous. They exist either in the Kulliyaét or independently under the
title of Diwan-i-Khusrau. A selection was lithographed in Cawnpore
in 1288 H. and it would appear from the preface by the editor that the
selection was made by the poet himself from his four diwins, whence

its title 2 wale sols olks This, however, is unlikely, for many of
the poems ascribed to a particular diwan in this edition are to be found
attached to other diwins in some manuscripts. There is, as we have
said above, a good deal of confusion in all the various collections, and
the only real selections made by the poet himself appear to be those
attached to the Ghurrat-ul-Kamal, and the Baqiya Naqiya, although
even there we find several common ghazals.

E. Prose Works.
(17) The I‘jaz-i-Khusrawi
or
Rasdil-ul-I'jaz.

Khusrau completed this voluminous work in 719 H. when he was
nearly seventy years of age. He had in 682 compiled four of the five
risélas (chapters or books) the work contains, but later on added to them
a fifth, comprising letters composed in his earlier life’ The work is
essentially meant to give specimens of elegant prose suitable for various
purposes and to explain the use of the various artifices that, according
to eastern ideals, add a ‘zest and flavour’ to all compositions, prose
or poetic, and was undertaken by the poet to demonstrate his prowess
in the field of prose as much as to provide instruction for the young
literary aspirants of his age. He claims to present in it a style unique
and original, distinct from all the old styles which he divides into nine
categories. This originality consists mainly in the employment of a
series of metaphors, each being sustained throughout one paragraph,
admittedly an innovation of the poet. According to Khusrau the nine
different styles of prose current in his time were as follows :

(1) The style of siifis and saints, which is of two kinds :—

(a) Of men of ‘gravity and stations ’,? like that to be met with
in Kashf-ul-Mahjaib,? Sulik-ul-Musafirin, and other similar
works ;

(b) Of men of ‘States ’,* like what we have in the works of al-
Ghazzali or ‘Ain-ul-Qudat al-Hamadani.

(2) The style of the research scholars® which is simple, forcible and
convincing. Examples: the Persian books of al-Ghazzaili and the
Persian translation of the Ihya by Majduddin Jajurmi.

(3) The style of the epistle-writers : neat and elegant, a mixture of
Arabic and Persian judiciously worked up, the best specimen of which
is provided by the translator of Kalila-wa-Dimnah of Baha-i-Baghdadi.

(4) The style of scholars and savants : a technical language suited
to each of the various sciences is employed.

1 See pp. 342 and 167 of the fourth and fifth risilas respectively. (Nawal
Kishore edition, 1876.) The work opens with the praises of God and the Prophet
-and a long eulogy of ‘Aléuddin Khalji whose chastisement of the Mongols and
-establishment of peace and order are described at great length in very glowing
‘terms. \We have already made use of most of the valuable material contained in
these introductory pages.

2 Ahl-i-tamkin wa maqamat. 3 Of Hujwairi.

4 Ahl-i-Hal. - 8 Gite SUe.-


--- Page 235 ---
217

(5) The style of orators and lecturers. It may be ‘plain’ or
‘ coloured ’.

(6) The style of teachers, which is ‘like a slippery stone placed on
the roadway by a clumsy workman—is avoided by the wise but causes
many a fool to stumble’. The lovers of this style are mostly obstinate
and deaf to the criticism of the wise.

(7) The style of common folk. It is plain, simple and to the point.

(8) The style of workers and craftsmen, suited to their various
professions. It is free from all affectation or ornament.

(9) The style of humorous writers, buffoons and clowns: a style
particularly adapted for amusing and creating a sense of the droll and
the ridiculous.

The author then proceeds to explain his own style ‘ which baffles all
writers, the miraculous epistles written in it being like semi-revelation ’1
He gives first the arrangement of the work. It is divided into five risalas
or main divisions,* each risala is divided into so many ‘khatts’ or
chapters, and each khatt is subdivided into a number of * harfs’ or
subjects.

1. The first risdla opens with a long introduction, detailing the
poet’s reasons for writing the book. The old style, he says, lacked
spice and zest, like the simple fare of the nomadic Turk or the Indian
fisherman. The present style is entirely his own. All the Arabic and
Persian verses used are his own productions. He does not favour the
use of verbal artifices. Ihim and Khayal are his favourite figures of
speech. The introduction closes with a warning to scribes to he careful
in copying the work and with detailed instructions as to the best methods
to be employed in writing a manuscript. He says here also how in
India there had been developing a new style of prose, ‘ mixed with sweet.
artifices, like water mixed with julep—a preparation of which the ice-
crunchers® of Mawardan-nahr and Khorasan were quite unaware ’.
He, of course, would present here the best specimens of this prose, in
spite of all the jealous criticism that his venture would bring upon him.

The author then comes to the proper subject of the riséla—the use
of suitable words and the formation of phra.es and sentences. It is
significant that he advises the use of as few Arabic words as possible,
preferably only such as have got two or more senses, capable of artistic
effects.

2 It is curious that Shibli (Shi‘rul ‘Ajam, II, 134) should describe the work
as containing three volumes. . ;

(R.1).

2. The second risila contains specimens of whole letters of all
kinds. ‘That which was a young plant in the first risila has become
a big rose-tree in this, blooming with the breeze of speech and a sweet-
voiced bird singing from each of its branches.’ There are in it official
letters, firmans, letters from elders to their youngers, and vice. versa,
letters of lovers, etc. There is among them a letter in Arabic addressed to
ShihSbuddin,* and another in pure Persian without a single Arabic word.®
‘One chapter contains some new proverbs in Arabic and Persian.‘ There
is an interesting letter addressed to Sadruddin, praising the sweetness
and flavour of bananas sent by him to the poet,® while another describes
the virtues of the betel-leaf.* Another interesting section deals with
music and musicians, as well as the different instruments generally
employed.” Among the musicians he mentions one Turmati Khatiin,
who through his assistance was admitted to the royal court. She was
placed, subsequently, in charge of all the Persian and Indian court
musicians.2 Other letters relate to astronomy, physics and medicine,
chess, hunting, law, etc.

3. In the third risdla the poet explains and illustrates the use of
literal or verbal artifices in prose. Some of these he claims to be his
own inventions. The risala is dull and uninteresting.

4. The fourth riséla, comprising altogether five kbhatts, opens
with a long introduction in which the poet relates his discussion with
two of his learned friends concerning man, his greatness, the means of
acquiring an eternal name, and the various styles of elegant prose—
that of the mashaikb or spiritual teachers, which may be likened to fire
on account of its passion and fiery appeal ; that of the old scribes, dull
and heavy like earth: that which combines the use of the two great
artifices Ihim and Khayal, an innovation of the author, which may be
compared to water ; and finally a peculiar style, rare and elusive like
air, a specimen of which may be found in the letter of Badr Hajib to
Prince Khidr Khan.®

‘The risala illustrates the use of the intellectual artifices and contains
sentences and letters bearing on different topics—law, exegeses, tradi-
tions and morality ; logic and philosophy ; grammar and lexicography.
Among them there are a firman or proclamation issued by ‘Alauddin

1P.2. (R., I). 2 His patron and friend, p. 168, 38 P, 173. -
4 P. 180 seq. Some of them are quite interesting and ingenius.

7 He names here: paikan, ‘ajab-rid; chuhra (?), duhul, chang, rab&b, daff,
aby, tanbir, dastak, dastén, shahnai, bablik, damsarfi (?) and batira. :

8 Other musicians mentioned are Mohd. Shah, Kunjashk, Khalifa Husain!
Algblaq, etc. Note that Mohd. Shah is algo mentioned by Barni (p. 199).

9 See Elliot, iii, 566. ;

219

Khaljf on his accession to the throne of Delhi!; the letter of Badr
Ha&jib referred to above,* another very humorous one describing the
mischievous discussions of two refractory youths with their grandfather
on points of law,® another addressed to his son Yamin-uddin Mubarak, etc.

The ris&la closes with a very curious passage descriptive of the red
rose (which he compares to various things) and the Prophet’s liking for
it, as expressed in the tradition ‘The red rose is of my blood’.* The
passage ends in a: fervent prayer to God begging for mercy and
forgiveness.

The letters in the risila are short and expressive, and, although
replete with figures of speech, are remarkably simple and interesting.
Many of them are evidently addressed to fictitious persons, but there
are some genuine letters that bear dates. The poet also mentions in
them several books relating to various sciences which were apparently
popular in his day. Among them are Panj Ganj, Kanz-i-fiqgh, Akbbar-i-
Najin, Akbbar-i-Nayyarain, etc.

5. The fifth risdla, comprising six khatts, contains, according to the
poet’s own statement, letters written in his younger days—before he
evolved the new stylethat he explains in the first four risélas. Amongst
the letters the most interesting are :—

(1) The proclamation issued by Ghiyathuddin B Balban after the
conquest of Lakhnauti® ; composed in 680 H.

(2) The letter to Saifuddin containing a very witty dialogue
between the pen and the sword ®;

(3) One to Najmuddin (Hasan) written in 687 from Oudh, when
the author went there with Kaiqobad 7;

(4) A letter addressed to Tajuddin Zahid, describing in a very
witty manner the havoc caused by heavy rains, the des-
truction of the author’s house and other incidents ®

(5) Another describing his own sufferings caused by the disease
known as ‘ Rishta’ or ‘ Nari ’® ;

and (6) Four humorous letters descriptive of a miserly Khwaja and
his strange doings, the grievances of a ‘ mukbannath’
due to the perverted tastes of the men of the times, and
an assembly of ragamuffin clowns, broken-down buffoons

and old worn-out dancers.
These last letters are a good specimen of a kind of humour, indecent
even to the extent of vulgarity, popular with old Eastern writers, and

not extinct even to-day.

The ris&la is followed by a long epilogue of about eighteen pages in
which the author speaks of his hard labours, requests to be excused for
mistakes and repetitions as he did not have sufficient time to revise the
book thoroughly, mentions how his friends, and particularly Shihabuddin
helped him in arranging and revising the work, and begs his critics to
be lenient and just in their judgment of its merits. The epilogue ends
in rather a despondent note, expressing regret at the passage of time and
the futility of the fame the author has achieved by his labours.

This work has generally been adversely criticized by modern scholars,
and it is true that there is not much in it that could interest us to-day.
But we must remember that conditions were very different in Khusrau’s
time, and that the ideas of what constituted elegance and beauty in prose
have changed considerably since then. Figures of speech and artifices
were the soul of all compositions and their importance was great when
Khusrau compiled the work. He at least introduced a healthy change
lby his innovations in as much as he attached more importance to ideas
and intellectual figures of speech than to senseless alliterations, quips
and puns. He was moreover supplying a pressing need of his age—a
comprehensive work in Persian on the science of epistle-writing so eagerly
sought after and so assiduously learnt by all literary men of olden days,
and we have no doubt that he succeeded quite well. But even for a
sophisticated modern reader there are plenty of things scattered in
the pages of the vast book that are both interesting and instructive.
Ahere are some useful bits of information about the social
conditions, the state of learning, the scholars, the sciences, andthe
political atmosphere of his age. There are, again, some important items
concerning the poet’s own biography, and there are pieces of a poignant,
though perhaps a bit morbid humour, characteristic of a man of
IXhusrau’s wide experience and sociable nature. Here is, for instance,
a passage from the fifth risdla that may well remain under the veil of
the original :

(18) Tintgy-1-‘ALAI
or
Khazdin-ul-Fitih.

This short history of the reign of ‘Alauddin was completed by
Khusrau in 711 H. and narrates the events that took place between the
years 695 u. and 711 m. Khusrau himself gives the reason for its
composition as follows :

‘The humble slave Khusrau whose pen, in spite of all its power
and versatility, is unable to compass the barest fraction of the glorious
king’s praises, had béen destined to sing of the glories of this reign,
and God in His bounty opened to him the doors of all the treasures in
the sky and on the earth giving him such jewels as had been denied
even to men like Buhtari and Abi Tammam. Yet still these priceless
jewels were not worthy of being scattered on the heaven-like threshold
of the mighty monarch. But as nowhere in the market of nature could
one obtain a better commodity, I had, perforce, to be content with
stringing them together for a present in the hope that they will be
accepted by the king who is an ocean of generosity. When I saw that
the wry and twisted words of this slave won the benign approval of the
king, I was tempted to try my hand in prose, as I had done in poetry
for perchance the king may deign to look at my composition as the sun
looks at the ‘capable’* stone. Although my pen has always been
devoted to poetry and has left untouched the beauties of prose, I dare
present this bride to the king, knowing that the eye of great men does
not pry into defects. If I had an eternal life I could not spend it better
than in singing the praises of the king, but as I know that life is short,
I had to be content with having just a handful of water from the
unfathomable sea of his excellence ’.*

As this is the only contemporary history of ‘Alauddin’s reign, its
historical importance can hardly be exaggerated, and in it, as in his
historical poems, Khusrau has narrated the facts with admirable accuracy
and wealth of detail. His language may be ornate and complicated, and

1 Khusrau gives the name Coal ol in the opening verse which heads

the work : —

The praise of God and the Prophet, of course, follows.

his encomiums of the king high-flown and exaggerated, but his narrative
is consistent and undistorted, and a thorough and comparative study
of the work is sure to be amply repaid.

From the literary point of view the book is as good, or as bad, as
any of its kind, the Tajul-Maathir, for instance. But it is certainly
original in style. Khusrau has utilized in it all the various artifices he
has outlined in the I‘jaz-i-Khusrawi, the most striking being the division
of the narrative into paragraphs of unequal length, each composed of ana-
logies derived from a particular thing—stars, water, fire, and so on.
The idea itself is a good one: it introduces variety into an otherwise
hum-drum narrative and splits it up into divisions, each devoted to a
particular topic, and in this respect it resembles another important
innovation of Khusrau’s—writing parts of a mathnawi in different metres.
But one cannot help feeling sorry for the loss of time and energy
caused by the adoption of such an artificial style in prose, and it is
not very easy to follow the sense clearly through all the mazes of similes
and metaphors. Khusrau, essentially a poet, has produced a work of
art rather than a history, and although he has told the historical facts
well, he could have told them better in a simpler and less laboured
style.

The contents of the work, most of which we have already utilized,
are as follows :

‘ Aléuddin’s expedition to Deogir when governor of Karra and
Manakpore (Rabi‘ IT, 695 .).?

His march on Delhi and accession to the throne the same year.®

The measures adopted by him for the spread of peace and pros-
perity in the kingdom, and for the suppression of heresy
and unlawful practices.*

The ‘Conquest of Ma‘bar by Malik Kafir, 710 #. and the return
of the victorious armies to Delhi in 711 8.1

Kbusrau concludes with a short epilogue containing excuses for
what he calls an imperfect and faulty composition, and prays God to
make it acceptable to the king and popular with all men.”

The following literal translation of a passage will suffice to give an
idea of the highly artificial style of this history.

‘When the army of the Turks that is an ocean of fire has already
burnt the thatched dwellings of our towns, it is apparent that its flames
are powerful enough to convert the stones of our fortress into lime.
This fortress called Dhur-Samandar, situated by a river, has always been
held in respect, and even if we cannot totally put out the fire of the
Turks’ swords when it leaps up into flames, we should at least try to
quench it, and since we have all to burn, let us not die without honour.’
The Rai became hot at their words and thus disclosed the fire that burnt
in his breast : ‘Our old and respectable fire-worshippers, the lamps of
whose minds burnt bright, have said clearly that never can the Hindu
stay before the Turk or fire before water. When it is so we can do nothing
but turn our faces away from the heat of the flames of the Turks’
daggers. Let us not pour water ® lest it be like oil on their flames and
make us the fodder of fire in our lives. Let us discard insolence and
pride and like water place our heads on the ground to meet them, for
thus perchance may the fire of their anger be a little cooled down ’.*

The curious innovation, of giving dates in the form of enigmas,
first explained by Khusrau in his I‘jaz-i-Khusrawi, has been very suc-
cessfully employed by him in this work. The method, if a little puzzling,
is, as Elliot points out, very helpful in the preservation of dates which,
if given in figures or even words, are liable to gross mutilation and
transformation, in the hands of a careless scribe.5 Thus the date of the
defeat and capture of ‘Ali Beg and Turtaq is given in the following
sentence : :

Lele gi SUF chy mg al dL 52 the de oh Sat pyle SL BM oo os

To find the date we have to add together the values of the ‘ foot”
(=tail or the last letter) of ‘Ali Beg, ic. kaf together with that of

1 ff. 35-56. 2 Foll. 84-85.

8 Ab rekhtan=to pour or shed water=to dishonour or put to shame.

4 Fol. 642. The passage describes an argument between the rajah of Dhur-
Samandar and his advisers. The rajah is reluctant to fight. The analogies are -
all from water and fire.

5 For examples, see Elliot, iii, 88.

silsila to the values of the ‘ head’ (=first letter) and ‘foot’ of Turtaq,
ie. t& and qaf. The total is thus 20+ 185+ 400+ 100=705 a.

Another striking feature of the work is the use of many single
Arabic verses (—'>#), all composed by the poet himself, some of which
are quite original in spirit. Thus he says of the elephants :

Jub) ope abl cil NH SUN Sah SS
Of ‘Alaéuddin’s military prowess:

Manuscripts of the work are very rare. The B.M. manuscript,!
which I have consulted, is a fairly well-written copy and is complete.
A lithographed edition has recently been published in Aligarh (1927).
It is copied from the B.M. MS. referred to above, but unfortunately is
full of mistakes, due either to faulty transcription or to careless editing.®
A careful and annotated edition of this work would therefore be highly
desirable.

(19) Afdal-ul-Fawdid.

Afdal-ul-Fawaid,? a comparatively short work, is a collection of the
sayings of Nizémuddin Auliya, the author’s spiritual guide. Written
apparently in imitation of his contemporary Hasan’s larger work,
Fawaid-ul-Fuad, the Afdal-ul-Fawaid is a book entirely different from
either the I‘jaz-i-Khusrawi or the Khazain-ul-futtih. Its language
extremely simple, easy, and unadorned by any figures of speech, provides
a good specimen of Persian as it was spoken in, Khusrau’s time.

There is very little in this work that would attract the attention
of an ordinary reader, but bits of useful information may be gleaned
here and there by one interested in things spiritual. One may also,
incidentally, find in it a few details about Khusrau’s own spiritual
career, and something about his contemporaries, such as frequented
the assemblies of the saint ‘ and listened to his saintly utterances or to
the more convival songs of the qawwals that kept them awake and

restless with spiritual ecstasy. It is divided into four parts. The first
part opens with a high-flown eulogy of the saint, and describes the
poet’s formal initiation into his spiritual circle in 713 H., when the
saint gave him a four-cornered cap and an upper vest (barani). ‘ Khusrau
presented this portion to the saint in Jumad II, 719 #., and the saint
granted him permission to continue the work, praising his efforts very
highly, and giving away as a reward his own cap and robe. The second
part, commenced after 719 H., was evidently left incomplete by
Khusrau.!

The following about music may be of interest: :

‘Then they talked of how some darweshes when dancing in an
assembly of sima‘ cry out and raise unmannerly shouts, and the Khwaja
(God reward him well) spoke thus in his benign way: ‘‘ They do a very
bad thing, for the people of sima‘ have never done that, and it is not
the way of the perfect ones. This sort of behaviour can be expected
only from deluded novices, for Hasan Basari has said that if a person
shouts in sim&‘ you should be sure he is a devil and comes from the
devil. A really spiritual man is transported to the world of angels and
is not forbidden from motion or dancing, for he swims in the ocean of
cognizance (or gnosis) and is unconscious of the existence of the eighteen
thousand worlds. Even as the gold melts in the crucible, so do the
people of sim&‘ in the world of bewilderment.” ’?

Here again is a passage about the mazamir or musical instruments: *

‘On Thursday, the seventh of Shawwal, I had the good fortune of
kissing the Sheikh’s feet. Those present were at that time talking of
sima‘ and of those who listen to it, and just then a man came in and
related that at a certain place a number of the saint’s disciples had
gathered together and had with them musical instruments. The Khwaja
thereupon said : ‘‘ I have often forbidden the use of such instruments and
other unlawful things. What they have done is not good”. And he
laid great stress upon, this point, even saying that the palm of one hand
should not be struck upon the other, nor the back of one hand upon
the palm of the other, meaning that clapping was strictly prohibited,‘
and that it was better not to use instruments.... He said after-
wards: ‘“ All great sheikhs have enjoyed sima‘, and those who know its
real worth and have taste and emotion are moved by a single verse
heard from a musician, whether there be any instrument or not. But

1 See pp. 110 and 130. : 2 Page 112.

3 Pages 126-127. Mazamir (sing. mizmar) are particularly musical pipes or
flutes (cf. the Persian nay). Certain musical instruments, such as the ‘ daft’ (timbrel)
or the ‘sitaér* have been declared to be lawful by some authorities.

4 Dastak (Hindi, Tal), beating time with hands, is a usual accompaniment of
singing in the East.


--- Page 245 ---
227

if one lacks the requisite taste it avails him nothing that there be a number
of musicians with instruments singing before him”. So we know that
this affair depends upon emotion and feeling and not on musical
instruments.’

CHAPTER V.
F. Kuusrav’s Hinpt Poetry.

Whether Khusrau wrote any Hindi poetry has recently been the
subject of controversy. The old biographers and anthologists, both
eastern and western, generally took it for granted that he did, and
quoted ghazals, conundrums, verses, etc., given out to be Khusrau’s,
in their anthologies, without the least hesitation or misgiving as to their
genuineness. But modern scholars, particularly those who have made
a special study of the development of Hindi in India, are inclined to be
sceptical about them. Their language, they point out, is very modern,
almost identical, in fact, with the Khari Boli or spoken dialect of to-day,
and very different from other specimens of Hindi found in prose and
poetry of undoubted antiquity and established authorship.

That Khusrau knew Hindi (or Hindii, as it was called in his time)
we have no reason to doubt. He was born in India which had been his
ancestors’ home for several generations, and his mother was of Indian
origin.! He must, then, have been thoroughly convorsant with the
spoken Hindi of his age, and much more familiar with it than were other
contemporary writers who knew the language only through, occasional
contact with such Indians as could not speak Persian—their domestic
servants, merchants, and so on. We have, moreover, ample proof of
his proficiency in this language in his own writings. He uses Hindi
words in several of his works, moderately and sparingly it is true, but
very aptly. That he does not employ them more often, is not due to
any want’ of knowledge but to his sensible dislike for introducing too
many foreign words into a language that had \glready been losing its
pristine purity in its new home. ‘It is not ay Siescent ’, he remarks,
to introduce Hindii words into pure Persian, except when unavoidable.
I have used them only where absolutely necessary ’.2 His own state-
ments would indecd show that he knew Hindi better than Arabic and

1 This is clear from what he says about his maternal grandfather, ‘Imad-ul~g
Mulk. See supra. That the latter was of a dark complexion and so fond of
betel-leaves would show his Indian origin.

2 Thus he uses: basith, pardhaén, mar-mar, etc. in Khazain-ul-futuh ; katara.
(a dagger) : ;

oh 605 &. We Dy 5 5  - pr gae ee F 62F pte 92 ol

8 Dib&cha to the Ghurra. Cf. ‘Ashiqa.


--- Page 246 ---
228

that he was quite proud of this. ‘I am an Indian Turk’, he declares,
‘and can reply to you in Hindi. I have no Egyptian sugar to talk of
Arabia and Arabic’. ‘As I am in fact’, he says again, ‘the Parrot
of India, question me in Hindii that I may talk sweetly ’.*

But did Khusrau write any poetry in the language which he professes
to know so well? A man of Khusrau’s genius and temperament, one
would think, could not help doing so, and he actually did so, according
to his own statement made in words quite unequivocal. When speaking
of his own works in the preface to his third diwan, he says: ‘I have
scattered among my friends a few chapters of Hindiii poetry also, but
I would be content here with a mere mention of this fact’.2 Moreover,
he gives a few specimens of verses capable of being interpreted both in
Persian and Hindi.‘ It is no wonder, indeed, if Khusrau wrote Hindi
verses, for according to his own statement, supported by other authorities,
earlier poets of foreign origin had done so. Mas‘id-i-Sa‘d b. Salman
who lived many years before Khusrau was born is said to have com-
posed a whole diwan in that language,’ and if we believe Firishta and
Nizémuddin, Hindi poetry was composed as early as the time of Mahmiid
of Ghazna.é

We have, however, no records whereby to judge the probable
volume of Khusrau’s Hindi poetsy. His own statement, quoted above,
would show that there was not much of it, and the assertion that it
exceeded in bulk his Persian poetry would seem to be a little exaggerated.

‘Nor, on the other hand, could the ‘ few chapters ’ referred to by Khusrau
be all that he produced, for he lived many years after he wrote the
‘preface to the Ghurrat-ul-Kamal and must have made numerous additions.!

Unfortunately Khusrau seems to have had very little regard for his
own Hindi verses. He probably scribbled the verses on bits of paper,
and ‘scattered ’ them, as he says himself, among his friends and thought
no more about them. The production of Hindi poetry was to him a
mere pastime, a diversion from his more serious efforts in Persian, the
language of Firdausi, Khaqaini, Nizimi, and Sa‘di,—the language of his
own ancestors,—which could never be equalled in importance by the
language of Hindustan whatever the poet’s sentimental regard for it
might have been. We can easily understand Khusrau’s neglect of his
Hindi verses when we consider that even in comparatively modern times
Persian was considered to be the literary language par excellence by the
Mohammadans of India. Ghalib, the great poet of Delhi, whose fame
to-day rests almost entirely on his small diwan of Hindustani or Urdu
poetry, attached a much greater importance to his Persian poetry which
few Indians read to-day. ‘Look at my Persian verse’, he says, ‘if
you want to see multi-coloured images, and leave aside my Urdu collec-
tion, for it is devoid of my true colour’.? It is certain, therefore, that
Khusrau never collected his Hindi vers in his life, and probably no
collections were made immediately after his death. All, then, that we
could expect to inherit of them through long centuries would be odds
and ends, scrappy poems and isolated verses that caught the fancy of
the populace and were transmitted orally or through private collections
-or biyéds to the succeeding generations. And such is exactly the nature
-of what to-day is alleged to be Khusrau’s Hindi poetry.®

This poetry, the genuineness of which has been subjected to grave
doubts in recent times, consists mostly of small songs, dohas (couplets),
riddles and conundrums, a ghazal with alternate Persian and Hindi
lines, a ‘mukhammas’ with every fifth line in Persian, some quatrains,
and the small tract known as ‘ Khaliq Bari’, a poem of mixed vocabulary.
Most of it has been consistently and persistently ascribed to Khusrau
by the old anthologists who apparently never doubted its authorship ;
but grave doubts can be raised, on this point on linguistic grounds. The

.

‘This, incidentally, also contradicta Garein de Tassy’s statement that Khusrau
-did not write any Hindi poetry except at the end of his life. He was only 37 when
he collected the Ghurra and he had already written some. (Lit. Hind. I, 301.)

language of this poetry is the language of to-day.1_ How could Khusrau,
in the thirteenth century, know the Hindi ‘which is spoken now round
and about Delhi? Why has no other old Hindi writer used that
language? The questions are pertinent,-and it is not easy to answer
them. We do not know what exactly was the Hindi of Khusrau’s time,
for there is no specimen of it except what we find in these disputed
verses. We know that Hindi? was the name given in his time to a
dialect spoken in and about Delhi, that the dialect had fairly developed
by that time, was capable of being utilized for literary purposes,? and
that poems were composed in it. What reason, we may ask, is there
to suppose that the dialect has changed a good deal since then—that the
spoken Hindi of his day was materially different from the Hindi
of to-day ? A language, once it has crystallized into. a definite form,
would not change very much, with the lapse of time, least of all in India
where everything moves so slowly and where there have been really few
influxes of foreign linguistic elements. Why can we not believe that a
peasant or a ‘bania’ of Delhi in the 13th century spoke almost the
same language as his descendants to-day, when we know that the latter
have almost the same physique, and physiognomy, the same dress, the
same habits, and the same customs as their remote ancestors had? One
can well imagine a Delhi jat dri¥ing out his team of bullocks in the early
morning with a ‘chaddar’ wrapped round his sturdy limbs, to be the
exact image of his great-great-grandfather. Why can’t we imagine his
words to be the exact echo of that distant ancestor’s ?

It would, therefore, seem to me to be unreasonable to declare this
poetry apocryphal on linguistic grounds. There may be parts of it
which are later compositions tacked on to the genuine ones: that has
happened in every country and in every age.» But there must have
been an original foundation, a real prototype (although it would, of
course, be very difficult to recognize it among the clever graftings and.
superstructures) and that foundation could not necessarily have been
very different from the additions.* It is possible, again, that succeeding
copyists have made slight modifications according to the idiom of the

1 It is wrong to assume that the Hindi in which Khusrau wrote was Brij:
Bhasha. Brij Bhashs and the dialect spoken in Delhi are two different branches of
Western Hindi.

2 More correctly Hindii, for that is how Khusrau always calls it.

8 See: Nuh Sipihr and the ‘Ashiga.

* See Supra.

5 The ruba‘iyat of Omar Khayyam are an eloquent instance of this tendency:.

6 The very fact that theso things have been, from oldest times, ascribed to-
Khusrau would show that Khusrau did write something of the sort. There would
be no point, for instance, in ascribing a fine landscape to an artist who painted only,
portraits. :


--- Page 249 ---
231

time in the forms of the words employed by Khusrau. Yet the intrinsic
excellence of some of these poems, the originality of their style, and the
wit and, humour pervading them mark them out clearly to be the work
of a great master like Khusrau, and we have no reasons to disbelieve
the popular tradition when it says that Khusrau himself wrote them.
Their meagre volume would, moreover, preclude the probability of any
wholesale grafting.

The other objection, namely that when the oldest Hindi composi-
tions are in High Hindi which was the recognized literary language
of old times, why should Khusrau’s poems be in ‘ Khari Boli’,! can be
easily answered. Khusrau’s greatest passion was originality. He always
wanted to do something new, to break away, as far as possible, from the
trammels of custom and tradition and to tread, paths hitherto untouched
by human feet. His Persian poetry and prose are sufficient proof of the
existence in him of this dominant passion, and it is easily conceivable
that the same love of innovation goaded him to write Hindi verse in a
new style. He had, moreover, probably no intention and no ambition
to leave behind him a literary monument in Hindi, a classic like the
Padamawat of Mohd. Jaysi,? and so had no occasion to follow any literary
traditions and regulations. He wrote Hindi verso just to amuse himself
and his friends, and he could, one would think, do that best in the
ordinary, familiar language of every-day talk. Most of the poems,
songs, riddles, etc., such as are given in Khusrau’s Hindi Kawita, have
therefore to be taken as Khusrau’s compositions, in the absence of any
convincing proofs to the contrary.

I would like to say here only a few words about the versified Persian-
Hindi vocabulary, the Khaliq Bari, popularly ascribed. to Khusrau.
The work, a small one in its present form but said to have been originally
written in several volumes, possesses very little of litcrary interest,
though a linguist may find it instructive. It is divided into parts of
unequal length in different metres, giving Hindi equivalents for Persian
and Arabic words.

The authorship of this work has been the subject of much contro-
versy. The author of Jaw&hir-i-Khusrawi recently tried to prove that
it was really Khusrau’s work. He was supported in his conclusion by
my able friend Syed Mas’id Hasan Rizavi of the Lucknow University.
Their arguments briefly are as follows :

1 Vide History of Hindi Literature by Misra Brothers (Vol. I, Introduction,
p. vi). TT ,

2 See Introduction (p. 1) to Text edited by Grierson and Sudhakara (Calcutta,.
1911). Other old writers were Chandra Barde and Vidyapati Thakur (1400 4.p.).
It may be interesting to note that this book is in the Oudhi dialect, which was
apparently different from the Hindi of Delhi in Khusrau’s time.


--- Page 250 ---
282

1. Khusrau’s age was a time when the need for such a voca-
bulary was pressing and a man of his versatile genius and
indefatigable energy was sure to turn his attention to it ;

2. It has always been considered to be Khusrau’s composition.
The author of the ‘ Allah Khudai’, written in imitation of
Khaliq Bari, for instance, seeks help from the soul of
Khusrau in the opening verses of his poem ;

"3. It contains certain words, such as ‘ jital ’, common in Khusrau’s
time, but unfamiliar to later writers ;

_ 4, The last verse contains Khusrau’s name so aptly and naturally
as to leave no doubt about the authorship.

But another scholar who has made a careful study of the develop-
ment of Urdu, especially in the Punjab, is disinclined to agree with the
above view and thinks it is a shame to ascribe to a great poet like Khusrau
.@ work that is of no literary value, is corrupt in its arrangement, and is
full of repetitions, defects of rhyme and irregularities of metre.

The essentially discursive and matter-of-fact nature of the work,
‘giving but few opportunities for the display of poetic talent, makes it
all the more difficult to come to any definite conclusion about the
Khiliq Bari, and much can be said for and against its being from the
pen of Khusrau. It may or may not be Khusrau’s work, and even if it
be, can hardly add much to the glory of the ‘ Parrot of India’. What
would a little feather of a sober hue signify in a plumage glittering with
gold and silver and the brightest colours of the rainbow ? It is, I think,
idle to discuss the question any further, unless we can get fresh material
for coming to a surer decision. The work in question is hardly of suffi-
‘cient importance for hot controversies to be waged over its origin.

CHAPTER VI.
Kuusrau—THeE Man.

There have been in the history of the world but few instances of a
‘scholar or a poet acquiring a popularity and a fame like those of Khusrau.
We may think, perhaps, of Byron and Shakespeare in England, of Goethe
‘in Germany, and of Sa‘diin Persia. But it was the personality of Khusrau,
his ready wit, His flowing humour, his versatile genius and his amiable
disposition, rather than his poetry, that rendered him Known all over
India. Centuries have elapsed since the ‘ Parrot of India’ sang his
last song and.the voice that had charmed princes and peasants was
‘hushed for ever, yet the memory of his name is as fresh to-day as ever.

One may still hear a venerable old man relate an anecdote about the
poet to eager young ears, a street urchin shout out a particularly gay
couplet of the poet while intent on his game of marbles, darweshes dancing
in mad rapture to the words of one of his ghazals, and women singing
in melodious chorus some of his Hindi songs.

The first thing that strikes one from a perusal of Khusrau’s work is
a keen sense of humour. He was comparatively a religious man, observed.
probably the principal ordinances, said his prayers, and fasted.’ He
did not drink wine, or at least was not addicted to it. In his old age
he was a regular attendant at the monastery of his sheikh. Yet he was
not a dry ascetic. He laughed and sang, listened to beautiful dancing
girls, and was present at the merry wine-parties of princes, and was
as much at home in a motley crowd of buffoons and clowns as in a
learned gathering of savants.2 He saw the misery in life and was some-
times sad, but he carried. his sorrows lightly. He saw what was ridiculous
and droll, and he laughed at it. He laughed at pedantic scholars, at
intolerant bigots, at hypocritical siifis, at miserly princes, and at ambitious.
plagiarists. Yet his laughter had in it nothing of malice, it was as
light as his spirits, good-humoured and amusing.

A great tolerance, such as must have been rare in his age, is the
other prominent feature of the poet’s character. He had few racial,.
religious, or social prejudices. He was proud of his Turkish descent,
but he was loud in his praise of India—its sweet flowers, its language,
and its dark beauties, and had not the slightest touch of that bitter
sentiment that made Khwaja-i-Kalin utter the well-known verse on
the eve of his departure from India : ‘ If once I cross the Indus in peace

[t is true, he could not free himself entirely from a certain amount
of haughty pride and a contempt for the conquered race. He calls the
Hindus ‘ crow-faced ’, warns the King against allowing them too much
power,’ ridicules some of their rites and beliefs,? and seems to be jubilant
over the destruction of their temples. But at the same time he is
sincerely touched by the grievances of the Hindu ryots and is emphatic
in his denunciation of oppressive ‘amils and ’a‘wans. He often praises
the Hindus in his writings. He admires their learning, their language,
their devotedness and faithfulness, quite as enthusiastically as the
warlike exploits of their conquerors. .

It was largely due to this broad-mindedness and want of prejudice
that Khusrau acquired such a popularity. He was sought after by
everyone. His presence in an assembly lighted, so to say, another
candle. Nobles and princes contested for his services and vied with
one another in rewarding him. Khusrau, on his part, was apparently
quite content to pass from one patron to another. Like a wandering
minstrel he went from door to door, tuned, his lyre to a different pitch
according to time and convenience, and sang with as much gusto the
praises of a murderer as those of his victim. But we should not judge
him by his glowing odes alone. Khusrau had to write them to earn his
bread and to keep peace with those in power. That he had, in fact, a
strong hatred for high-flown panegyrics is clear from several of his remarks.
He had an inherent dislike for falsehood and hypocrisy, but circumstances
often forced him to throttle his conscience. Yet he never stooped to
meanness, and never degraded his art by a wholesale production of
panegyrics. His ‘mamdiih’, as he himself claims, was always a king
or a prince, and he never betrayed a patron in whose service he happened
to be. If he praised other men, it was only at the request of his patron
and then, too he ‘ poured just a drop of his own pure honey into the cup

1 See supra.
2 He says, ‘I am amazed at the dung-worshipping Hindus’, alluding to their

reverential belief in the virtues of cow-dung (r# 22 owy & Gate 5 db 3)

8 ‘ My poetry is not like that of other poets ’, he says, ‘ for I have never praised

ul-Kamal). . .

of their praise’! without the slightest expectation of monetary reward.
‘If, however,’ he declares, ‘they out of their generosity offered some
reward, and I accepted it, it was no more than the price of the paper
that contained my verses—even if it was a thousand ‘ nabati’ tangahs,
for.....mno one can buy a single verse from me, as nobody could ever
sell paradise ’.?

He was generous with his money, and had the greatest contempt
for miserliness. He shared his rich earnings with his friends and rela-
tives, and it is in his dealings with these that we see the real man that
lay concealed under the mask of the courtier and the panegyrist. His
love for his mother was unbounded, and he loved his brother and his own
children with a great affection. Two of his sons died in his lifetime and
he mourns them in some of the finest elegies in his diwins.? His daughter,
too, had a huge share of his affections and he has addressed a whole
chaptor of the Hasht Bihisht to her.* The advices given by the poet to
his ‘paradise daughter’ would, of course, appear to be stern and
puritanic to a modern reader. One may almost conclude from some of
them, as Shibli does,® that Khusrau did not think too highly of the
intellectual and moral strength of women and was an, advocate of rigorous
confinement. But what clse could one expect from any man of that
age? That he had the highest esteem for the tender love of a mother,
a sister or a wife, we cannot deny,® and if he has been led to make some
disparaging remarks about women in general, we should not condemn
him hastily. He is certainly much more respectful towards them than
the great Persian writer Sa‘di.

Unlike Sa‘di, again, Khusrau never preaches duplicity and hypo-
crisy. He himself avoided these as far as possible in word and deed, and
always advised others to be frank and sincere. He had numerous friends
and to some of them he was greatly attached and always expressed
his gratitude for their help. He had numerous rivals, too, some of whom
seem to have harassed him a good deal, but he did not worry himself
about them. His attitude towards them was one of good-humoured

CHAPTER VII.
Kauvuskav-—THE ARTIST.

Among the first and foremost essentials of poetry, and especially
that of the highest order, is a keen sense of the picturesque and the
beautiful, as well as the ugly and the grotesque, and withal a power
to portray the aspects of nature in a manner both convincing and lucid.
The poet has to choose his fancies and to choose his words ; he has to
select such particulars as will best illustrate his point, and to tell them
in the most suitable words. Descriptive poetry, in particular, requires _
a great command of language and a very judicious selection and combina-
tion of words, and Khusrau was undoubtedly _ one of the few Persian
poets who have excelled in this art.

Nizami, in his Khamsa, has produced some wonderful specimens of -
descriptive poetry. His language is affected and his analogies some-
times far-fetched, but on the whole the result is a highly artistic picture.’
Sa‘di, too, comes out occasionally with a very brilliant simile or meta-
phor. But no poet before Khusrau’s time had developed the art to such
perfection as he did. The whole of his poem Qiran-us-Sa‘dain, as we
have seen, is a collection, of brilliant pen-pictures illustrating various and
diverse things. Similar and equally good sketches are abundantly
scattered throughout his works. He describes briefly and vigorously.
Thus, to quote an instance, he says of the wily slave engaged by Khusrau
-Parwiz to give Farhad the false news of Shirin’s death :

‘The King had a negro guard, sour-visaged, wry-tongued. In his
demon.-like face he resembled a minister of hell, and in his senseless talk
he was like the jack-daw. His belly was like a furnace full of fire and
his mouth like that of an irreconcilable money-lender. Nobody ever saw
his mouth closed or one of his lips touch the other.. Quarrelsome, of
devilish disposition, a scoundrel ready to fight and scuffle, he abused
vilely those whom he praised before their faces. If one was absent
from his home for some days, he would tell his relatives that he was

dead. He laughed merrily in funerals and scattered dust on his head in
weddings.’

He says in his description of the Yajaj ?:

‘A crowd wandering é¥erywhere like demons, they shame
with their swift movements the ghouls of the wilderness. Countless
in numbers, scattered over miles and miles, they are like the sand
particles in a desert or the thorns on a mountain. If they betook them-
selves to a river to drink from it, in a moment the river would be dry.
Flowers and, grass disappear wherever they go. Their eyes are as small
as those of the carcass-eating dogs and in the length of their ears they
have excelled asses: neither modesty nor wisdom can one behold in
those narrow eyes and those long ears. Their ears hang down unto
their feet like a skirt, yet hide none of their ugliness. They go to sleep
contentedly with one ear below and the other above, for their ears are
their cloaks, their armour, their silk and cotton garments. Their brows
wrinkled knot upon knot and their beards hanging down to their knees,
their bodies covered with a blanket of thick hair, their eyelashes yellow,
their faces red and their eyes blue,..... they have big bellies, small
feet and long nails. They appear naked before one another freely and
have shame neither before a child nor a mother. Day and night they
revel in concupiscence and none of them dies unless he has produced a
thousand. In their fruitless mountains and inauspicious abode where
an, owl could be called a bird of good omen, they can, get no better food
than the kbartit.’ #

Other instances of Khusrau’s wonderful power of portraiture can
be found in his descriptions of the captive Mongols,’ the charms of
Leylaé and Dewaldi, the musicians and dancing-girls,* and scores of other
passages. 4

He was also a great artist in the selection, of apt similes ; and here,
too, we discover instances of his originality. He would disregard, for
example, the old classic simile of comparing the graceful gait of the
beloved to that of a peacock or a pheasant, and liken it instead to that
of a pigeon. The killing eyes of the beloved he would compare to Hindu
robbers with ‘ kataras’ rather than to murderous Turks.®

The use of musical words and metres’ is, again, one of his great
characteristics, and he often produces a quaint effect by the use of an

unfamiliar rhyme. Thus, one of the ghazals has for its rhyme words
like Tatta, jatta, latta, matta, patta, albatta, etc.)

This naturally brings us to the question of Khusrau’s attainments
in music. He has sizice very remote tints been regarded to have been
as great in music as in poetry, and able to express in musical numbers
even the sounds produced by a gong or a carder’s bow.? Tradition, again,
ascribes to him the invention of the sitar as well as of several new melodies
compounded, of Persian and Indian tunes, and he is said to have defeated in
an, open, contest a famous musician of the Deccan, Nayak Gopal by name.®
That Khusrau had studied well the science of music is abundantly clear
from his writings. He seems to have been quite familiar with the
Persian system and to have known, well all its intricécies—the four
usiils, the twelve pardahs, and so on.* He knew well also the Indian
system and was a great admirer of it.6 Musical contests, too, would
appear to be a favourite pastime of his day, and Khusrau did apparently
take a keen interest and an active part in them® It is quite reasonable,
therefore, to believe that he made some attempts to combine the Persian,
and Indian systems and to evolve new melodies characteristic of the new
Indo-Persian, culture of India. But it is difficult to determine exactly
the extent or importance of the modifications introduced by him.
According to an old Persian work on Indian music (which is supposed
to be a translation of an older work written in the time of Rajah Mansingh
of Gwaliyar), he invented the following new melodies: mujir, sazgari,
aiman, ‘ushshaq, muwafiq, ghazan, zilaf, farghana, sarparda, bakbarz,
firodast, mun‘am (?), qaul, tardna, khayal, nigdr, basit, shaihana, and
suhila.’

It is useless to enter here into the technical niceties of music or to
try to establish the identity of all his inventions, but there is no doubt

5 See Nuh Sipihr : I‘jaz-i-Khusrawi R. II, p. 288.

6 See I‘jéz-i-Khusrawi (R. II, p. 180 seq.), where he mentions the arrival of
the musicians from Khorasan and invites Indian musicians to compete with them
so that the ‘ dove-pigeons of B&lé may know how the Indian birds sing’.

7 Ragdarapan : cf. Shibli. :


--- Page 257 ---
239

that the popular melodies qaul and ghazal were first introduced into
Indian music by Khbusrau. Qawwéals all over India recognize him to
be their master, even to-day.

Khusrau’s innovations, however, were not universally acclaimed.
His independence of thought and love of things new had, led him to break
away from the old traditions and to form a schismatic school which has
always been looked down upon by the supporters of the classical system.!
To any impartial lover of music, nevertheless, the change would seem
to be healthy and pleasant. It is a pity, indeed, that no more men
of Khusrau’s calibre were born in India to drag her music out of the
old stagnant pool.

The invention of the sitar, again, has been so persistently ascribed
to Khusrau that it is now generally accepted to be a fact beyond doubt.
The sitar, originally meaning a three-stringed instrument,? is a simplified
form of the old Indian instrument vina (which is said to have been
invented by Mahadeo himself*), and might at any time: have been
evolved in India. Khusrau’s age would, perhaps, seem to be a time
particularly suited for this evolution. But unfortunately I have been
unable to trace the name ‘ sitar ’ anywhere in Khusrau’s writings, although
there are pages full of the description of the various instruments used
in his time. Nor does any of his contemporary, or even later writers
mention, the name. The only instrument peculiar to India (and
probably a new invention) would seem to be the ‘ajab rid, which does
not appear to resemble the sitar at all. Indeed, it is hard to trace the
name in any but the comparatively modern Persian literature of India,
while it occurs in Turkish and Persian poetry of a much earlier date.‘ _
This would induce one to presume that the sitar was originally invented
in Persia, or rather Caucasia, and was introduced into India in later
times. The ‘ tar’, in fact, is the national musical instrument of Caucasia
and Georgia to-day, and it was probably from these countries that the
instrument spread into the western lands under the names of zither,
guitar, etc. But still the fact remains that even some reliable authorities
ascribe to Khusrau the invention of this intrument, and there is no
doubt that it was evolved from earlier instruments during the time

1 See Wajid ‘Ali Shah’s ‘ Saut-ul-Mubarak ’, p. 42 seq. He describes Khusrau
aa a ‘nayak’ of Khayal as opposed to that of Dhirpad, and his disciples as Khayalis.
According to him Khusrau invented the tunes known as Tarana, Chhand, Parband
git, qual, qilbanah, naqsh and gul. See also Ain-i-Akbari, Text II, 138-39.

2 It has now generally seven strings.

3 Other ascribe its invention to Nared, the mythological son of Brahma and
Saraswati. See Asiatic Researches III, p. 67. For a description of the instrument,
see ibid., I, p. 295 seq. ~

4 Even Abul Fadl, for instance, does not mention it in the list of Indian
musical instruments. (Ain-i-Akbari II, pp. 138-39.)


--- Page 258 ---
240

when Persian and, Indian cultures came into close contact. The sitar,
which resembles the Persian tanbir or ‘id in shape and the Indian
vina in principle, is itself an epitome of the Indo-Persian civilization.
Whether, however, Khusrau actually produced any new musical
instrument or not, it is certain that he was highly skilled in the science
of music, had, in fact, probably won the title of Naik or Nayak,’ and
introduced important and valuable changes into the old Indian system.

1 See Saut-ul-Mubarak, pp. 42 and 47, where the term is defined as meaning
‘one who knows the three ‘surs’ or ‘mats’. The title was the highest for a
musician, the lower grades being : pundit, guni, garidarp, and gain. According to
the author, Khusrau was only naik-i-kbayal and not naik-i-dhurpad, and by his
innovations ‘ destroyed all the regulations and instruments established for thousands
of years’, while his disciples in their audacity ‘vied with the kalaiwants, the re-
presentatives of the old system that dates back to the time of Mahadeo ’.

Khusrau, which was believed to have been irretrievably lost has been discovered
and published at Hyderabad.1 The work was first found by the late Maulvi Rashid
Ahmed of Aligarh in the library of M. Habib-ur-Rahman Sherwani where it lay
unnoticed under the title of ‘Jahangir Namah. It would seem ‘to be a curious
irony of fate that when Nawab Ishaq Khan, in the course of his wide and strenuous
search for the works of Khusrau, approached M. Habib-ur-Rahman, the latter
told him that he knew nothing about the Tughlaq Namah. Maulvi Rashid Ahmed,
however, studied the so-called Jahangir Namah very carefully and camo to the
conclusion that it was the long-lost mathnawi of Khusrau prefaced by a few
verses by Hayati who, at the desire of Jahangir, undertook the onerous task of
completing the mathnawi that had lost its opening and concluding chapters.2 The
learned Maulvi even wrote a masterly introduction to the work, wherein he tried
to establish its authorship. Unfortunately, however, he died before he could
complete that introduction and the work again lay unheeded for a number of
years.

Recently Mr. Syed Hashimy happened to see a copy of the Habibgunj MS.,
and after a critical perusal of the poem and the introduction by M. Rashid Ahmed
was entirely convinced that the poem was the Tughlaq Namah itself, and made the
happy decision of editing and publishing it. He based his reading of the text on
the copy referred to above and the original manuscript, which is so far believed
to be the only one in existence.

The published work is preceded by a fairly lengthy discussion about the loss
and discovery of the Tughlaq Namah and its historical importance, a notice on
Hayati, a very thorough analysis of the poem and the incomplete introduction by
M. Rashid Ahmed. The Editor must have been considerably hampered in his
task by the fact that the manuscript is unique and, apparently, not very carefully
written. He has, however, done the work with admirable industry and intelligence,
although there still remain several verses that are doubtful and unintelligible,
many others that could have been read better by a little more attention, and a
fairly large number containing what would appear to be misprints undetected by
the Editor, for he does not mention them in the corrigenda.

In its present form the mathnawi contains altogether, 2,896 verses of which
179 belong to Hayati and the rest (2,717) to Khusrau.! Hayati, as he says himself,
was asked to write the opening as well as the concluding chapters of the poem ;
but, although he apparently did write them, the concluding verses are missing.?
The introductory verses contain praise of God and a eulogy on Jahangir. Khusrau’s
Tughlaq Namah opens with two isolated couplets believed to be a remnant of the
portion containing ‘hamd’ and ‘na‘t’. They are followed by a story illustrative
of how a worthless thing acquires value by the appreciation of a great man, and
the poet, with the usual apologetic remarks about the quality of his work, expresses
the hope that it would gain renown by the benign approval of the King. The
following chaptérs, twenty-four in number, are all headed by rubrics in verse (abyat-
i-silsilah).8

It would be useless to discuss here the authenticity of the poem. The argu-
ments given by M. Rashid Ahmed and the Editor are sufficient to dispel all doubts
on that point. To these I may just add one more that come to my mind during
the perusal of the mathnawi. In one of his odes in the Nihayat-ul-Kamal, written
soon after Tughlaq’s victory over Khusrau Khan, Khusrau compares the former
to Abii Muslim, ‘the avenger of ‘Ali’s family’ and it is significant that the same
simile occurs more than once in the mathnawi.4

Below I give a brief summary of the poem.

The poet first tells us how the king selected him from amongst the poets of
his ‘ paradise-like’ court, each one of whom was a ‘sweet-tongued Firdausi’,
to write the story of his victory and how he complied with that request. The
story then commences with a description of the licentious life of Mubarak Shah,

1 Not counting the abyat-i-silailah, which we should not, as the Editor does,
include in the mathnawi proper. According to Amin Razi and Hajji Khalifa the
complete poem contained three thousand couplets, so that 283 couplets are missing.

his unbounded favours to the ungrateful slave, Khusrau Khan, the murder of the
king by that slave assisted by Baraidiis or Baraéwis? on the first of Jumad II,
720 u., the sacrilege of the royal harem and the usurpation of the crown by Khusrau
Khan with the connivance and active help of several nobles, Musalman and Hindu.
Among the latter he mentions Maldeo and Nagdeo with their retainers consisting
of Chandals and Meos. He then gives an account of the cruel fate of the five
younger brothers of Mubarak Shah who were snatched away from the arms of their
distracted mothers, the two elder ones being killed and the remaining three blinded.2

The poet then remarks how all the governors and nobles consented to Khusrau
Khan’s rule placidly, so that ‘neither a Turk lifted the Turkish lance nor a Hindu
slave struck at the Hindus ’—all, except ‘the dragon of war’, Malik Tughlaq who
was furious on hearing of the distress and dishonour suffered by the house of his
former master, ‘the king of martyrs’, ‘Ala‘uddin.3 Further details of the cata-
strophe were conveyed to the Malik by his son, Jiné Khan through a messenger
named ‘Ali Yaghdi, and upon hearing them, he swore a terrible vengeance against
the usurpers. His first step was to ask his son to join him at Deopalpur. This
the latter did, fleeing away from Delhi accompanied by his faithful confidant, the
son of Bahram and a number of followers. Hasan (Kbusrau Khan) was filled with
consternation on learning about this flight and his ministers now advised him
to put an end to the lives of the three surviving princes and thus root out the royal
family. The unfortunate princes were accordingly dragged out from their prison
and beheaded. Large sums of money were at the same time lavished on the nobles
to silence them and to ensure their allegiance. Hasan, afraid of Tughlaq’s revenge
and conscious of his own weakness, was prepared to placate him by recognizing
his independence in his province and even adding to the territory already under his
sway 4; but Safi Khan, one of the most bitter opponents of Tughlag and a staunch

supporter of Hasan, advised him to send instead a strong warning to Tughlaq and
to ask him to acknowledge Hasan's sovereignty. A messenger was sent forthwith.
‘Tughlaq was so enraged on receiving the message that he killed the messenger and
sent back a reply full of contempt and anger.

Tughlaq now sent messages to several governors and nobles inviting them to
join him in ridding Delhi of the foul presence of Hasan and his accomplices. Among
those thus approached were (1) Malik Bahrim Abthi, the governor (mir) of Uchcha ;
(2) Mughaltai, the governor of Multan ; (3) Muhammad Shah Lur, the governor of
Siwistan ; (4) Yak Lakhi, the governor of Samana; (5) Hoshang, the governor
(muqte‘) of Jélir; and (6) ‘Ainul-Mulk Multani, who was in Delhi. Of these Malik
Bahrim alone readily welcomed the suggestion of Tughlaq. Mughaltai refused to
join Tughlaq, but was killed by his own soldiers who were in favour of taking up
arms with the malik and were secretly instigated by one Bahram Siraj. A similar
fate overtook Yaklakhi who sent Tughlaq’s message to Hasan and himself started
for Delhi, but was overtaken and killed by his own men. Mohd. Shah Lur was in
terrible plight when the message reached him, being besieged in the fortress by
his mutinous soldiers. He, therefore, welcomed the message which served him as
“the talisman of deliverance’, 1 for the insurgent soldiers, realizing the importance
of the occasion, set him free and he marched out with them to join Tughlag. He,
however, did not reach Deopalpur in time. Hoshang’s response was half-hearted.
He promised to join Tughlag, but delayed action until too late. ‘Ainul-Mulk,
‘afraid for his life, showed Tughlagq’s letter to Hasan, but since the malik was anxious
to win him over he sent him another message. ‘Ainul-Mulk expressed his sympathy
with Tughlaq’s undertaking, and explaining his inability to take up arms openly,
promised to refrain from supporting the usurper.

Tughlaq strengthened by Bahram now started to make his warlike prepara-
tions in earnest. He was helped in this task by a large treasure from Multan that
was being conveyed to Delhi but fell into the hands of his followers. On his side,
Khusrau Khan watched these preparations with growing anxiety. Desiring to
nip the trouble in the bud, he sent a large army ® under his brother, Khan-i-Khanan,
who marched up to Sarsuti and besieged the garrison that was under the com-
mand of Malik Mahmiid. Tughlaq, hearing of this invasion, marched forth with
his army and reached ‘Alapiir on the bank of the Beht (Bias). Khan-i-Khanan’s
army consisted of Musalmans and Hindus,—‘ Hindu rawats riding on Indian horseg
with flattering Brahmins raising the shouts of “ harmahade ”,3 the “ badénwats” #
and “bhats” singing warlike songs; the Bariwis mounted on Arabian horses
‘swift like the fiery smoke, their hair and moustaches hanging on their coal-black

faces, wearing silk vests with silk ‘ bahrmans ” thrown over the shoulders, their
foul bodies smeared with perfumes and their teeth black with the ‘tanbul”’’.
Among the Musalmens in his army were Amir Qatla, who fell fighting in the battle ;
Siifi Khan ; the ‘Arid Shasti Khan Qurqmar and Yaklakhi.! In the ensuing battle
the Khan’s army was routed with great slaughter, and a dozen elephants with
numerous prisoners and large booty fell into the hands of the victors. Tughlaq,
however, was very kind to the prisoners and their wounded were carefully tended.

The stage was now set for the final episode of the drama. Tughlaq marched
on towards Delhi, while Hasan made frantic and nervous preparations to meet
him. Huge sums of money were distributed by the latter among his followers so
that the ‘treasures collected from Bakhtar and Khawar’ 2 were all scattered, the
greater amount going to the Hindus. He then marched out from Delhi at the head of
a huge army with a large number of elephants and set up‘his camp at Haud-i-Khas.3
On his side, Tughlaq, marching through Hansi, Medinah, Rohtak, Mandoti, Palam
and Kishenpur 4 reached the Haudi-Sultani,5 and pitched his tents at Lahrawat, the
Jumna at his back and the city of Delhi in front. The two armies lay face to face
overnight. On the following morning (Friday, the 30th of Rajab) Khusrau Khan
formed his army in battle array. His right wing was under the command of Yusuf
Khan §8ufi, Kamaluddin Safi, Shasti Khan Qurqmar, the vakil of the palace Kafir
known as the Muhrdar (Seal-bearer), Shihab the naib of Kafir, Qaisar the Hajib-i-
Khas, Malik Ambar, and the governor of Oudh Bahauddin Dabir.6 On the left
there were his brother Khan-i-Khanan, Rai Rayan Randhil, Gajbarmanag (?),”
Sunbul, now called Hatam Khan, ‘the crafty’ Maldeo and Tablighai Yaghdi.®
A host of Baréwis with rais and ranas, ten thousand strong, supported the line of
elephants. Among them were Ahirdeo, Abardeo, Amardeo and ‘demons upon

of Samana who was killed on refusing to side with Tughlaq (see supra.).

demons’, Then there were Narsih, Séinsth, Parsih, Harmar, Bairimar, and Parmar,
‘ all like serpents and crying mar, mar. Their sandal-hued robes made the moist
sandal-wood dry with shame. The snake, they say, coils round the sandal-tree,
ut here one saw the sandal coiled round snakes. The Hindus strutted haughtily
with their long lances and spears looking like black deer with tall horns. An
apostate dog appeared at their head like the false dawn in the dark night.’ Their
pigtails were tapering in form,! and many of them had hog’s teeth hanging from
their necks.2, Meanwhile, true to his promise, ‘Ain-ul-Mulk had stolen away from
the royal camp and with his followers had set out on the way to his provincial
seat at Ujjain.

Tughlaq was reluctant to start fighting at once as his men were tired after the
long march from Deopalpur. But the advance of Hasan’s army left him no choice.3
After exhorting his men to be prepared to lay down their lives in their righteous
cause and taking promises of loyalty from them, he arranged them for the battle.
He placed his nephew Bahauddaula, Malik Bahram and ‘Ali Haidar in the right
wing, while the left wing was commanded by his son Fakhruddin (Juna Khan),
another nephew Asad, Shihabuddin, and Mir Shadi. Tughlaq himself was in the
centre ‘his body unclad in any armour, two lofty lances stuck in the ground on his
right and left’. He ordered all his officera to tie peacock feathers to their banners
so that the enemy might not be able to distinguish his flag from theirs. The war-
ery of his followers was to be the word ‘Qala ’.5

The battle now started and Hasan’s army made such a fierce onslaught that
Tughlaq’s followers were swept off their feet and their ranks were broken up. He,
however, remained firm in the centre and rallying around him about five hundred
men personally led a severe counter-attack. Cutting down all before him he reached
right up to where Hasan stood under his canopy. A deft stroke of the veteran’s
sword brought the canopy down on his head and in panic he took to flight. His
disheartened companions soon broke up in confusion and were slaughtered and
plundered by Tughlaq’s men. But at this juncture an army of ‘more than a

4 Peacock feathers had been the distinguishing mark of Tughlaq’s flag in all
his former campaigns. [The Editor misreading the text explains that this was
done in order to distinguish Tughlaq’s flags from those of the enemy (Introduction,
p. 59). The text (p. 122) has :—

thousand black-visaged Barawis, their faces painted red’ attacked the malik,
erying ‘ Narayan’ to the ‘Allaho-Akbar’ of the Musalmans.1__In the ensying fierce
and hand-to-hand struggle, the malik’s banners were all struck down. This was a
critical moment for Tughlaq. He, however, stood his ground and drove back the
Hindus with great slaughter.

He now asked a soldier to hold his banner aloft and another to go on beating
a drum before him and promised them big rewards if they would remain firm and
not leave his side. The sound of the drum and the sight of his ensign soon re-
assured his scattered followers and they flocked round him. Looking about him
the malik now beheld another army that had apparently remained out of action
and uninjured. This reserve detachment was led by Sifi Khan. The malik at
once swooped down upon it and the enemy took to their heels. The defeat of the
Delhi forces was now complete. The flying followers of Hasan were hunted down
mercilessly, although some consideration was shown to the Musalmans.? and huge
treasures fell into the hands of the victors.

That night the malik remained in his camp outside the city. The following
morning he rode in state to the royal palace and called all the surviving maliks
and amirs to his presence to disucss with them the future of the throne of Delhi,
He told them how he, a mere soldier of fortune, had been taken into service by
Jalaluddin who raised him to a high position,? how he was further exalted by
‘Ala‘uddin and his brother Ulugh Khan, and how, therefore, he was shocked to
hear about the destruction of the ‘Alai family and had sworn to take revenge. He
had, he said, no personal ambitions and wanted to go back to his old seat at Deopalpur
to fight the Mongols as he had done so far.4 But the nobles pointed out to him
that there was no prince of the royal family left and that, under the circumstances,

no one had a better claim to the throne than he who had distinguished himself in.
eighteen campaigns! and had now won the crowning victory against Khusrau Khan.
After much hesitation and on repeated requests from the maliks, Tughlaq accepted.
the crown, and even before he had finally given his word, the three royal canopies
were brought out and placed over his head. Thus on Saturday, the Ist of Sha‘ban
720 u., Tughlaq ascended the throne with the title of Ghiyathuddin (the Helper
of the Faith).2

The story ends with the capture of Khusrau Khan and his brother. The latter
had hidden himself in the house of an old woman. His hiding place was found out
and Juna Khan (now Ulugh, Khan) took him to the king who ordered him to be
paraded in disgrace through the streets of the city and then beheaded. Khusrau
Khan was next captured in a garden where, deserted by his followers, weary and
helpless he had found a temporary shelter from the pursuing horse-men. Ulugh
Khan was again deputed to bring him to the king’s presence. The prince, promising
amnesty, brought him to his father who demanded from him an explanation for all
his misdeeds, recounting them one by one. In reply Khusrau Khan could only
plead that it was fate and his evil companions who had goaded him to do what
he had done and said that he was thoroughly ashamed and repentent. He beseeched
Tughlaq to spare his life and to punish him with blinding so that he could retire
to some village to end his remaining days in peace. But Tughlaq said: ‘What
you ask is not hard to grant ; but how can I spare your life? Since my enmity
to you is for the sake of the faith (din) I must punish you as you deserve. If I
pardon you, people will blame me for all the misery that has befallen them, and
I shall be deviating.from Islam and showing acquiescence to infidelity. All my
labour and the hard-won victory shall thus be wasted and I shall feel ashamed
before the souls of those noble persons in whose cause I had girt up my loins.”
He ordered him to be taken away and beheaded at the very spot where he had
killed his master, Mubarak Shah. Thus after having been crowned for just two.
months the gory head of the unfortunate usurper rolled down the terrace of the
Hazar-Sutiin to be trampled upon by his exultant enemies.

The text comes to an end here. A concluding chapter with its heading given
in the manuscript as:

Sle 5 ‘oy y Sh I Gel T jae

is entirely missing. The mathnawi, written in hexametric ‘hazaj’ (mahdhif),.
does not offer many attractions to a student of literature. It is on the whole a
plain narrative with but a few of those lively and imaginative passages that
characterize Khusrau’s other poetical works. The poet often indulges in quips
and puns, some of which are certainly over-wrought and fail to amuse the reader.
Nevertheless some of his descriptions are very fine and one comes across a number

1 Most of these were faught against the Mongols. (See pp. 137-138 of the
text. Note that sJ in line 2661 should read ,j—the name of a Mongol prince.)

8 This chapter, as indicated by thé rubric, must have dealt with the bestowal
of titles and other honours by Tughlaq Shah on his sons and the faithful maliks.

of extremely good similes.1 Hindi words and phrases have also been very aptly

introduced.2 The historical importance of the poem cannot be denied. Khusrau |
tells the story with characteristic frankness and rare accuracy. He gives us many

particulars about one of the strangest and most tragic episodes in the chequered

history of the throne of Delhi—particulars that we do not find elsewhere. Only

one would wish that he had omitted certain unpleasant details that at places become

positively gruesome. / In any case, the discovery of the Tughlaq Namah would be

welcomed not only by the literary admirers of Khusrau but by all studente of

Indian history.
