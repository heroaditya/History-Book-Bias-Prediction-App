TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE

I

THe Emperor Akbar (reign 1556-1605 A.p.) set the example of
having a detailed history of his reign written by official command.
The result was the Akbar-namah or ‘Book of Akbar’ of Abul Fazl
(completed by other hands after that author’s death). Then came
the Emperor Jahangir, who dictated his own memoirs, known as
the Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri, and therefore no official Jahangir-namah had
to be written about him. ‘This book, however, combines the literary
characteristics of an autobiography with those of an official history,
or in other words, it gives the Emperor’s own reflections and feelings
as well as an objective record of the events of his reign. Indeed, in
this reign, the literary type of the Mughal official histories was
determined for the future, as was exemplified by the Padishahnamah
(Shah Jahan), the ‘Alamgir-namah (of Aurangzib, completed by the
Maasir-i-Alamgiri), the Bahadur Shah-namah (Shah Alam I) and later
attempts like the Tarikh-i-Ahmad Shahi and the Tarikh-i-‘ Alamgir
Sani.

In all these works, or Namahs proper, the events are built upon
a rigid skeleton of dates chronologically arranged; there is an
accurate but tiresome assemblage of minute names of persons and
places in the course of every month’s narrative of occurrences, and
the mechanical division of the book into a chapter for each regnal
year is followed. Such a collection of facts, if it is to be correct,
requires a basis of written official records, and this basis was supplied
by the waqgai’ or official reports of occurrences regularly sent from
every province to the central Government of Delhi. By an order
issued in the 24th year of his reign (1580), Akbar appointed in
each province of his empire a uniform set of officers, one of whom
was the Wagqai‘-navis or Recorder of Events. (Akbar-némah, Bev.
tr., iii. 413, also 559). Jahangir continued the system. As he writes,
“It had been made a rule that the events of the subahs should be
reported according to the boundaries of each, and news-writers from
the Court had been appointed for this duty. This being the rule
that my revered father had laid down, I also observe it, .... and
information is thus acquired about the world and its inhabitants.’’
(Tuzuk, Roger’s tr. i. 247, see also Baharistan-i-Ghayibi, Borah’s
tr. i. 209.) But the system of appointing secret news-writers to the
provinces was really borrowed by the Indian Mughals from the
‘Abbasid Khalifs who had borrowed it from the ancient Iranian
empire. The different classes of these news-reporters and their
method of work are fully described in my book, Mughal Administra-
tion, ch. IV. sec. 6.

When this State intelligence-department was fully developed
with the expansion of the Mughal Empire under Shah Jahan and
Aurangzib, (1627-1707), a huge collection of reports, written on’
small slips of paper and transmitted to the capital in bamboo
cylinders (nalo) at regular weekly or fortnightly intervals,—came to

be formed in the archives at the capital. Besides these there were
the akhbdrat-i-darbar-i-mu‘ala, or reports of everything that was
done or said in public at the Court or camp where the Emperor was
present in person. These were written daily,—sometimes twice a day,
when (as usual) there were morning levees and evening Courts held
by His Majesty. Such akhbarats or manuscript news-letters were
sent to the vassal princes, provincial governors, and generals out on
campaign by their paid agents at the imperial Court, and differed
only in their place of origin from the letters coming in a contrary
direction, namely the letters of the Government spies in the
mufassil which supplemented the more open reports of the official
wagai’-navis.

On this accumulated mass of accurate, detailed, and absolutely
contemporary records of occurrences, some Persian author, known
for his mastery of polished courtierly prose, was selected by the
Emperor to work and write the Namah or official annals of his
reign. The book was read to the Emperor and corrected under the
royal direction before being passed for publication,—the term
‘publication’ here meant, the release of the book for being copied
for presentation to the princes and high nobles. The Emperor, after
one or two trial hearings, delegated the work of revision to his
wazir.

These official annals, in addition to being full of nauseating
flattery of the author’s patron and his ‘‘sacred’’ offspring, were,
extremely verbose ; for example the record of the first 20 years of
Shah Jahan’s reign occupies 1662 printed pages of 22 lines each (or
83°'1 pages for a single year on the average); the history of the
first decade of Aurangzib’s reign covers 1107 pages of the same size
(or 110°7 pages for one year). But their details and dates of
incidents are valuable, though I have detected instances where the
Namah has given a wrong date owing to the carelessness of the
historian’s clerks in making extracts from the waqi‘a in the imperial
record office for being worked into his history. However, the
survival of the akhbdadrat for that particular day has enabled me to
correct the wrong date entered in the Namah.

It must also be conceded that the author’s flattery of the
Emperor, though fulsome and offensive to modern taste, is more
a defect of manner than one of fact. In these official histories, no
fact has been really falsified, though credit is often given to the
Emperor where he did not deserve it. We shall have more patience
with the courtly author and derive greater profit from his book if we
remember that he is only following the facon de parler prevalent
in Asiatic courts. And why Asiatic only? The Stuart king of
England was styled ‘‘His Gracious and Sacred Majesty’ and
Napoleon’s Moniteurs were not models of factual veracity. Thus,
with a Namah in our hands, we get the true basis for a narrative of
the events of that monarch’s reign and can then form our own
judgment of the characters and political forces. Their chief defect
—and one which disqualifies them from being called histories in the
modern sense of the term, is their absolute silence about the economic
and social aspects of the times, and what is known as “‘the condition
of the people’.

The history of the first ten years of Aurangzib’s reign was
written, under his orders, in the form of a full-sized Namah, by
Mirza "Muhammad Kazim, under the title of ‘Alamgir-namah.
(Printed in the Bibliotheca Indica series by the R.A.S. Bengal.) But
after the author had completed the first decade, the Emperor forbade
him to continue it any further. The reason for this prohibition is
given by Sdqi Musta‘d Khan as, ‘‘Because this monarch of the
external and internal universe preferred laying the foundations of
things esoteric to displaying things external’, (p. 68 of the printed
Persian text.) What really happened was that when (about 1670)
the history of the tenth year was completed by Kazim, Aurangzib
curtailed his State expenditure. and closed the costly department of
prolix official annals. There is no authority for the popular legend
that he forbade the writing of his history by any one else as a crime
or that Khafi Khan’s history is so entitled because it was written
in secret (khufia) in fear of any such royal prohibition. The word
Khafi has nothing to do with khufia ; it really means ‘a native of
Khwaf’,—a_ district of Khurasan situated between Herat and
Nishabur (Encyclopaedia of Islam, ii. 866.)

Aurangzib’s finances did not improve when the second decade
of his reign ended in 1678. He now found himself too much in-
volved with the tribes on the Afghan frontier and was soon afterwards
too hard pressed by the Rajputs and the Marathas, to allow him to
spend any thought or money on such non-utilitarian purposes as
the compilation of a florid and verbose chronicle of his reign. And
his circumstances did not improve up to the end of his life. Thus
it happened that no complete history of his reign came to be
officially composed while he lived.

After his death (in 1707), his last secretary and_fa ite
disciple in State policy and religiosity, I‘nayetullah Khan Kashmiri,
urged Saqi Musta"d Khan to complete the history of such a model
sovereign. In order to help him in this work, the State archives
were thrown open to him and he made extracts of the necessary
materials to be used in his book, which was completed in 1710 and
entitled Madasir-i-‘Alamgiri. For the career of ‘Inayetullah, see
Irvine’s Later Mughals, 1. 259 and 333; he rose to be Wazir under
Muhammad Shah and was keen on reimposing the jazia on the
Hindus, (Ibid. 1. 103-105).

Of our author Muhammad Saqi Musta’d Khan’s life, we know a
few facts only, all supplied by him either in his own History of
Aurangzib or in his preface to his patron Bakhtawar Khan’s book
the Mirat-ul-‘dlam. He was brought up by Bakhtawar Khan (a
favourite officer of Aurangzib, whose character is noted in the
Maasir, (p. 253 of the printed text). In this Khan’s establishment
our author filled the offices of munshi and diwan. He assisted his
patron, during the last seventeen years of his life, in the composition
of the Mirat-ul-‘dlam, which Aurangzib authorised him after
Bakhtawar’s death, to make public. He then passed into the
imperial service with a mansab. He held under this Emperor. in
succession the posts of mushrif of the ja-namaz-khanah, waqdi‘navis.

of Thursdays, mushrif of the Khawases, and munshi of the nazaral,
(text, pp. 253, 255, 407, 462.)

A gentleman of Patna City, named Babu Ram Bahadur (alias
Chhotu Lal), has a Persian ms. named Insha-i-Matlub, which contains
letters written by Saqi Musta‘d Khan to his contemporaries, but it
lacks pp. 9-48, and the paper is old and brittle.

The Madasir-i-‘Alamgiri has been written in a very much
abridged form compared with the Namahs ; on an average it gives
11 pages to one year’s narrative, against 110°7 pages for one year of
the same reign in the ‘Alamgirnamah. But the loss is really one
of the flowers of rhetoric rather than of facts. Consequently in
many places it reads like a dry list of official postings and promotions
as in our Government Gazettes. But its other portions give valuable,
sometimes interesting information, especially the few that embody
the author’s personal observations and reflections on events, or
character-sketches.

In this translation the text has been slightly condensed. Not
a single fact or date has been omitted by me, but the prolix wording
of some sentences has been replaced by a plain recital of their
substance, and many trite reflections and moralisations (which are
conventional in Persian historical literature at the beginning of a
chapter or section) have been omitted altogether ; also, verses and
long laudatory phrases. But every significant epithet has been
preserved. I have inserted the page numbers of the Persian original
in the body of my translation, so that any curious reader can easily
satisfy himself that this is a complete reproduction in English of
the historical matter of the original text. All the Hijera dates have
been converted to the Christian era according to Swami-Kannu
Pillai’s Indian Ephemeris.

This translation was made by me many years ago for my own
use, and it was laid aside when my History of Aurangzib in 5
volumes was completed. On the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal
agreeing to print it and thus fill a long-standing gap of 51 years in
the authentic sources of Mughal Indian history available in English,
my translation was compared word for word with the original,
revised, and in several places expanded by the addition of phrases
and sentences from the original which had been omitted in my
rather too utilitarian first version. Every word of the Persian text
which I now consider to be significant and necessary for bringing
out the author’s tone and spirit, has been restored.

In this work of revision I have been very greatly helped by
Professor Nirod Bhusan Roy, M.A., whom the Society has appointed
to assist me in preparing the copy and seeing this (and several other
books planned by the Society) through the press. He has gone
through my translation with meticulous care and persistently drawn
my attention to every point where he thought it better to modify my
former wording or amplify a passage in order to make it correspond
more closely to the original author’s intentions. After discussion,
I have in most cases accepted his view and made the change. After
the press-copy had been thus prepared and a portion actually set in
type, I was supplied, through the courtesy of Khan Sahib Sayyid

Hasan Askari, M.A. (Professor, Patna College), with an old manu-
script of the Persian original, transcribed about 1750, from the
Wagqf Library of Diwan Nasir Ali (in Khujwan, Arrah district),
which furnishes a much more correct text than the printed Biblio-
theca Indica edition and fills up certain serious gaps in the latter not
noticed when the text was printed. My English translation has been
revised a second time by collating it with this newly found manu-
script under Professor N. B. Roy’s care, and a great improvement
effected. Most of the emendations I have made in the printed Persian
text from this manuscript and other authentic sources, are indicated
by inserting in the body of the book the word Cor within brackets,
without burdening the pages with a footnote on every variant reading.
Many other obvious errors of the printed text also have been silently
corrected. For this enhancement of the usefulness of the translation,
the reader’s gratitude is due to Professor Roy.

Owing to the present difficulty of printing, the translation has
been printed with a bare minimum of the most necessary diacritical
marks, namely 4, ¢, and the apostrophe for ‘ain. But it has been
considered unnecessary to insert these minarks in the case of words
which occur most frequently, or continue the system to the end of
the book after following the rules for several pages. Nor have I
been able to maintain uniformity in the spelling of proper names
throughout such a long book full of such names. This is particularly
the case with regard to the final h.

The elaborate index has been prepared by Professor Nirod
Bhusan Roy and ought to prove very helpful to the reader by reason
of its accumulation of information and methodical arrangement. ‘The
glossary of obscure words has been added by me.

MAASIR-I-“ALAMGIRI

CHAPTER I

WAR OF SUCCESSION BEGINS

[2]* On the 6th Sept. 1657/7th Zil.H., 1067 A.H.
the Emperor Shah Jahan, who will henceforth be designated
‘Ala Iazrat,—fell ill at Delhi, [8] and had to give up the
work of government. His eldest son, Dara Shukoh, seizing
the opportunity, closed the roads of the arrival of néws from
the provinces, and this led to great disorder in the Empire ;
(so that) Murad Bakhsh, the fourth son of the Emperor, and
Subahdar of Gujrat, crowned himself (there), and Shah
Shuj‘a, the Emperor’s second son, did the samme thing in
Bengal, and advanced with his army on Patna. Dara
Shukoh, in his fear of Aurangzib’s power, (had) tried to
alienate Shah Jahan’s mind from him, and by means
of various lies induced him to recall to Court the army
previously sent to reinforce Aurangzib. And with the
design that in the Emperor’s lifetime and under his
protection he would get rid of Shuj‘a and Murad Bakhsh
and then with peace of mind turn to the affairs of the
Deccan and the removal of Aurangzib, Dara conveyed the
Iymperor to Agra when his disease was at its worst. He
sent Raja Jai Singh with imperial and his own troops
under the command of his eldest son Sulaiman Shukoh
against Shuj‘a. At the same time Raja Jaswant Singh,—
who being related to Shah Jahan’s mother, was greatly
trusted and given the title of Maharaja, and was one of the
chief Rajas of Hindustan, was sent with a large army
towards Malwa on the way to the Deccan, in order to
bar the road. A separate force under Qasim Khan was
appointed to accompany the Maharaja to Ujjain, and,
{4] if found politic, to start against Murad Bakhsh.
Through Dara Shukoh’s magic arts the Emperor’s mind

was somewhat estranged from Aurangzib. He ordered ‘Isa
Beg, Aurangzib’s agent (at Court), to be imprisoned for no
offence, and confiscated his property; but after a time
realising the shamefulness of this act released him. Among
the villainous ways of Dara Shukoh—what became the chief
cause of Aurangzib’s wrath was the inclination of his heart
to the principles (or practices) of the Hindus and the
spreading of disregard of Islamic religious prohibitions
(Ibahat and Ilhad), Therefore, considering it necessary to
defend the faith and the State, Aurangzib determined to go
to Shah Jahan and to carry (with himself) Murad Bakhsh,
who after doing some foolish acts, had at this time sub-
missively begged the patronage of Aurangzib. As it was
probable that Jaswant Singh and Qasim Khan would fight,
Aurangzib prudently collected the means of war, and on
Monday, the 25th January, 1658/1st Jamad A., 1068 A.H.,
started from Aurangabad towards Burhanpur, where he
arrived on Thursday, the 18th February /25th Jamad A.,
and whence he sent a letter to Shah Jahan (begging per-
mission) to visit him in his illness. No reply came in one
month, but alarming news continued to arrive. Jaswant, at
the instigation of Dara Shukoh, displayed aggression. On
the 20th March/25th Jamad 8., Aurangzib started for
Agra, and on Wednesday, the 14th April /21st Rajab, when
marching from Dipalpur [5] he met on the way Murad
Bakhsh, who had come from Ahmadabad to see him.
Aurangzib halted at Dharmatpur (situated 7 kos from
Ujjain), one kos off from which village Jaswant Singh and
Qasim Khan had encamped for the purpose of fighting.
The enemy stepped beyond their limits and prepared for
fight. On Thursday, the 15th April 1658/22nd Rajab,
Aurangzib marshalled his army in battle order, and beat
his drums for battle. Jaswant, too, drew up his troops and
rode (out) to fight, and the two armies clashed together.
Though the Hindus were very numerous they were
slaughtered, and at last Jaswant took to flight with a small
party towards his ‘home’ Marwar.

[6] Qasim Khan and other imperial soldiers considered
it fortunate to fly with their lives from such destruction.
Aurangzib gained the victory and captured all the property
of the enemy. At the Prince’s order nearly six thousand
dead bodies of the enemy were counted.

On Sunday the 23rd May 1658/1st Ramzan,
Aurangzib crossed the Chambal and heard that Dara

1658] BATTLE OF SAMUGARH 3

Shukoh had advanced from Dholpur. On Friday, the
28th May /6th Ramzan, he arrived near the army of Dara
and halted at a distance of 114% kos. Dara on horseback
advanced that day a little in front of his camp, but not
daring to step further in his fear of Aurangzib, he tormented
his soldiers, who were all fully armed, by keeping them all
the day in the burning wind. Vast numbers perished of
excessive hunger and thirst. At the end of the day he
retired to his place. The following day, Aurangzib ordered
his army to advance towards Agra. ‘That morning, the
29th May 1658/7th Ramzan, Dara drew up his army on
the ground he had taken up the day before and advanced
against the army of Aurangzib. A violent battle followed ;
it began with the roar of guns and muskets on both sides;
and the fire of slaughter blazed forth. Rustam Khan,
Rao Chhatra Sal, Raja Rai Singh Rathor and other chiefs
of Dara’s army were slain, and although [7] he still had
a (large) body of troops with himself, his firmness was
shaken ; he descended from his elephant and mounted his
horse. At this untimely move on his part his soldiers were
disturbed in mind and took to flight. The breeze of victory
blew on Aurangzib’s banners. One of the wonderful signs
of Aurangzib’s fortune was this, that, while so many
commanders of Dara Shukoh were slain that the like was
not seen in any other battle,—not to speak of his losses in
common soldiers—not one of the leaders of the victorious
army perished except ‘Azam Khan alias Multafat Khan,
who died after the victory from the violence of the (hot)
wind. -

Dara after his flight arrived at his house in Agra in the
evening with his son and a few servants, and after staying
for three prahars (quarters) of the night took the road to
Delhi. Aurangzib, after rendering thanks to the Giver of
Victory, reached the enemy’s camp, and stayed in the tent
of Dara Shukoh, which was standing. Next day the army
marched to Samugarh. This day he sent a humble letter
of apology to Shah Jahan, excusing himself for the occur-
rence of the battle. On Tuesday the Ist June/10th Ramzan,
he reached the garden of Nurmanzil situated in Agra. Shah
Jahan sent a reply to the letter, and on the day following
presented to him a sword [8] named Alamgir. The high
grandees and other imperial officers came in troops to the
Court of Aurangzib in hope (of his patronage) and each
received favours suited to his rank. On Friday, the 11th


--- Page 15 ---

June /20th Ramzan he entered the city and occupied Dara
Shukoh’s palace. On the 12th June/21st Ramzan he learnt
that Dara Shukoh had arrived at Delhi on the 5th June /14th
Ramzan. Although Aurangzib’s aim was to see Shah
Jahan, yet Dara had by secret letters filled the Emperor’s
mind with distrust of Aurangzib. Therefore he gave up his
design and on Sunday the 18th June /22nd Ramzan started
for Delhi. On Tuesday, the 15th June/24th Ramzan, he
received at Ghatsami the news of Dara’s flight from Delhi.
On the 21st June/30th Ramzan, Bahadur Khan was
appointed to pursue Dara. As Murad Bakhsh was violently
preparing for rebellion and was waiting for an opportunity
to carry out his futile plans, Aurangzib made him a prisoner
at Mathura, on Wednesday the 23rd June/2nd Shawwal,
and thus freed the people from mischief and tumult; the
captive was sent to the fort of Delhi under Shaikh Mir.
On learning that Dara Shukoh had started for Tahore,
Aurangzib decided to set out for the Panjab.

FIRST CORONATION

As astrologers indicated Wednesday the 21st July /1st
Zil Q., as an auspicious day for the accession, [9| and no
time was left to go to Delhi and make preparations for the
ceremony, Aurangzib stayed for a few hours in the garden
of Aghrabad [=Shalamar], and sat on the throne at the
above-mentioned auspicious time. The presents which
were made to the Princes, the high grandees, the mansabdars
and other officers, are beyond numbering. ‘Abdur Rashid
Tatawi found the date of accession in the Quranic text,
Ati’u-allah, &c.

PURSUIT OF DARA

As this coronation ceremony was decided to be short,
many of the rites of accession were put off to the second
(year’s) ceremony, e.g., reading the khutba, stamping
coins, and settling the Emperor’s title were not carried out
on this occasion but kept in abeyance.

Before the accession, an army was sent under Khalil-
ullah Khan to join Bahadur Khan, reach the Satlej, and
arrange for crossing that river. Aurangzib now learnt that
Sulaiman Shukoh had hastened towards Hardwar from the
other side of the Ganges river, intending to join his father


--- Page 16 ---
1658] DARA’S FLIGHT IN THE PANJAB 5
by the road of Saharanpur. Aurangzib appointed Amirul-
umara alias Shaista Khan and Shaikh Mir and other chiefs
to engage in the expedition against him. On Thursday,
the 22nd July/2nd Zil Q., [10] he ordered his tents to be
pitched outside, for the march to the Panjab. On Wednes-
day, the 4th August /15th Zil Q., a letter was received from
Bahadur Khan announcing the crossing of the Satlej by the
imperial army and the flight of Dara’s men. At this time
Sulaiman Shukoh fled into the hills of Kashmit and so the
Emperor ordered the force sent against him to return.

Dara after reaching Lahore collected nearly 20,000
troopers, and on hearing the news of Bahadur Khan and
Khalillullah Khan’s crossing the Satlej, he posted a large
force under Daud Khan on the Bias river to bar their way,
and sent Sipihr Shukoh after him. Thereupon the Emperor
wisely ordered Raja Jai Singh and a few other chiefs to
join the first detachment. Dara learning of it found that
he could not resist, and started from Iahore towards Multan.
At this time Maharaja Jaswant Singh came from his
country and rubbed his forehead in humility and shame at
the threshold of the Court. The Emperor graciously par-
doned his faults, showed him imperial favours and sent him
to Delhi.

On Sunday, the 12th Sept. /24th Zil. H., the Emperor
came to know from Khalilullah Khan and other nobles at
Haibatpuri Pati that Dara Shukoh had come out of Lahore
with adequate equipment and was intending to fight the
imperial forces, and that on seeing this the imperial officers
had slackened their pursuit. Thereupon, the Emperor sent
Prince ‘Azam from this station, with the unnecessary
soldiers and baggage [11] to Lahore, while he himself
decided to make a forced march. When he learnt that Dara
Shukoh, without standing firmly even in Multan, had
started for Bhakkar and that many of his followers had left
him, and the causes of his trouble were on the increase, the
Emperor gave up his forced march and travelled by easy
stages to Multan, without halting anywhere. Although Saf
Shikan Khan had left Multan on Wednesday, the 22nd
Sept. /4th Muharram, in pursuit of Dara, yet for greater
caution Shaikh Mir too was sent with 9,000 troopers on the
same errand. At this time the Emperor heard that his
brother Shah Shuj‘a to whom he had been strongly attached
before his accession, had come out of Bengal with hostile
intentions.

Hence Aurangzib set out from Multan on Thursday the
30th Sept. /12th Muharram, and arrived in Delhi fort on
Saturday, the 20th Nov. /4th Rabi. A., News of Shuj‘a’s
disturbance came in succession. The Emperor had intended
to overlook (Shuj’a’s conduct) as far as possible, but when
Shuj’a audaciously advanced to the frontier of Benares, he
determined to fight. The Emperor had no help but to order
Prince Muhammad Sultan to march out of Agra in that
direction on Saturday, the 4th Dec./18th Rabi. A. As it
was repeatedly learnt that Shah Shuj‘a wished to advance
beyond the limits of Benares, the Emperor considered it
politic to go to the hunting-lodge of Soron and wait for the
news about Shuj‘a, so that if he returned towards Patna the
IXmperor would recall his deputed troops, otherwise he would
fully engage in the expedition against him. [12]

Therefore, on Thursday the 2nd Dec. 1658/16th
Rabi. A., he left Delhi. On the 6th/20th Rabi. A., news
came that the deputed troops had reached Etawah on the
5th. The Emperor advanced hunting and reached Soron on
Sunday, 19th Dec. /3rd Rabi. S. As his design was to make
a peaceful end to the affair of Shuj‘a, he sent him a letter
full of good counsels to learn the details of his intentions.
But when he learnt for certain that gentleness and mercy
would be thrown away on him, he set out from Soron on
Tuesday the 21st Dec. /5th Rabi. S., to put him down. Order
was sent to Muhammad Sultan and the detachment not to
force an encounter but wait for junction with the Emperor.

-On Sunday the 2nd January, 1659/17th Rabi. S., the
imperial tents were pitched outside the village of Korra,
where Prince Muhammad Sultan was staying with the
advanced detachment, and four kos from which Shuj‘a was
waiting. Mu’azzam Khan, who had been summoned by
cominand from Khandesh, arrived in the imperial camp on
this day.

ry

BATTLE WITH SHAH SHUJ‘A AT KHAJWA

Shuj‘a, planting his artillery in front, wished to
marshal his ranks in battle array. On Tuesday, the 4th
January/19th Rabi. §., the third day following the
Emperor’s arrival at Korra, it was ordered that the artillery
should not be carried in front but made to fire opposite the
army of Shuj‘a, and the imperial army should bravely
engage in battle. [13] At the imperial order, waves upon


--- Page 18 ---
1659 ] BATTLE OF KHAJWA 7

waves of troops rushed forward, while nearly 90,000 horse-
men prepared themselves for action. It was ordered that the
Emperor’s camp and tents should remain where they were.

That day Shuj‘a, too was engaged in marshalling his
troops. After four gharis of the day had passed, the
Emperor traversed the distance separating (his camp) from
Shuj‘a’s, and when three prahars had passed he drew up his
ranks a mile from Shuj‘a’s army. Shuj‘a without advancing,
sent some pieces of cannon in front and there was a hot fight
till nightfall, when Shuj‘a withdrew his artillery. After
taking steps for precaution and watchfulness, strengthening
the entrenchments, and urging his troops to be on the alert,
the Emperor retired to a small pavilion, pitched on the
battle-field.

Towards the end of that night an event happened which
short-sighted men regarded as a catastrophe, and which
caused a dispersion in the imperial army. It was as follows.
The wicked Maharaja Jaswant Singh, who outwardly pro-
fessed obedience but at heart sought for some occasion for
mischief, at the very tine when the Emperor had given him
the command of the right wing, planned to take to flight and
informed Shuj‘a of his design. At the end of the night,
he turned back with all his own troops and another body of
Rajputs, and first plundered the camp of Muhammad Sultan
which was in his way ; great oppression [14] was committed
on the camp; alarming news spread; mischievous people
laid hands on the imperial effects and the property of the
nobles and soldiers. When the Emperor heard of it, he did
not stir from his place. Although nearly half of his army
had dispersed, yet the Emperor relying on Providence did
not pay any heed to his smallness of number, but set out for
the battle-field. This day Shuj‘a changed the formation he
had adopted the day before, and drew up his troops in
another manner.

The firing of rockets, guns and muskets began between
the two sides. This day many serious reverses befell the
imperial army; the Emperor had not more than 2,000
cavalry round himself, yet in whatever side he turned his
face or made a firm stand, the damage was repaired. And
at the sight of his intrepidity and valour, his Bahram-like
soldiers by their heroic exertions made such a terrible des-
truction of their enemy that Shuj’a’s ranks were broken.
He fled from the field, and the imperialists gained this


--- Page 19 ---
8 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI [cu. 1

wonderful victory solely through the aid of Heaven and not
through their own efforts. [15]

The Emperor thanked the Giver of Victories, and,
passing with his army through the camp of Shuj‘a which
was near the tank of Khajwa, halted. That very day
he sent Prince Muhammad Sultan from the place in pursuit
of Shuj‘a, and himself stayed there till Tuesday, 11th
January/26th Rabi. S. On Wednesday, the 12th he
marched from the environs of Khajwa and on Friday the
14th /29th Rabi. S., he came to the river Ganges. At that
stage Mu’azzam Khan and other great nobles were deputed
to join Prince Muhammad Sultan in pursuing Shuj‘a.

PURSUIT OF DARA SHUKOH CONTINUED

I shall now write about the army detached under Shaikh
Mir and Saf Shikan Khan to pursue Dara. On Wednesday,
the 22nd Sept. /4th Muharram Saf Shikan Khan hastened
from Multan in pursuit of Dara, crossed the Bids river and
heard that Dara had gone further on. The Khan, therefore,
advanced and after a few days’ halt in expectation of Shaikh
Mir and Dilir Khan was joined by their army. News came
that Dara had crossed the river at Bhakkar and halted at
Sakkar. The imperial officers thought it best that Shaikh
Mir and Dilir Khan should cross the river with their soldiers
and march along the other bank towards Sakkar, while Saf
Shikan with his troops should hasten along this side towards
Bhakkar, so that the enemy might be crushed between the
two sides.

Next day according to the plan Saf Shikan Khan [16]
parted from Shaikh Mir and started for Bhakkar. Shaikh
Mir crossed the river in two days and arrived within 12 kos
of Sakkar on Saturday, the 23rd Oct. /5th Safar, his army
reaching Sakkar on the 24th. Three days before this Saf
Shikan Khan had arrived at Bhakkar but had marched away
the day before Shaikh Mir’s arrival. It was found that Dara
had gone forward on the 18th Oct. /30th Muharram, leaving
his heavy baggage in the fort of Bhakkar, the rest of his
treasures and property were in boats while he himself was
travelling through the jungles. Daud Khan and other
leaders among his followers having deserted him, (Dara)
wanted to go from Sakkar towards Qandahar, but at the
desertion of his followers and the refusal of his women he
had started for Tatta. Saf Shikan Khan left Aghar Khan


--- Page 20 ---
1659] DARA DRIVEN FROM SINDH _ 9

with a force at Bhakkar to press the siege hard and himself
went towards Siwistén. A letter of Muhammad Salih
Tarkhan, qiladir of the place, now reached him saying
that Dara had come within 5 kos of the fort, and that Saf
Shikan Khan should come up quickly and bar the path of his
treasure boats. The Khan sent his relation Muhammad
Ma‘sum in advance with a force, to pass beyond Dari’s boats
and entrench on the bank of the river. He himself marched
at night, passed 3 kos from the front of Dara’s army, waited
for the enemy’s boats, and wished to cross the river and
attack the enemy. As Dara’s boats advanced and opposed
the arrival of the boats accompanying Saf Shikan, he sent
a message to Muhammad Salih to send boats from that side
and also oppose Dara. As Muhammad Salih was not divinely
guided to carry out this order, he sent to say that on this
side the water ([17] was waist-deep, and so the boats would
pass by the other side; therefore Saf Shikan Khan did not
cross over. Next day it became evident from the dust-cloud
on the other side that Dara was marching and removing his
boats by that side. Thus a splendid victory was frustrated
through the duplicity of Muhammad Salih.

In short, Dara crossed the low hill of Siwistan, and Saf
Shikan Khan marched two stages in pursuit of him on that
very side of the river. Shaikh Mir arriving on the other
bank sent a message saying that it was better that Saf Shikan
Khan should cross the river and come over to his side, so
that the two might carry on the pursuit together. Therefore
Saf Shikan Khan crossed the river, and learnt that Dara
had reached Tatta and intended to go to Gujrat. Saf
Shikan Khan hastening before Shaikh Mir came within one
kos of the river at Tatta, but Dara marched away towards
Gujrat from the other bank of the river. Saf Shikan Khan
crossed the river, by building a bridge in seven days.

Meantime an order was sent to Shaikh Mir, Dilir
Khan, and Saf Shikan Khan to give up the pursuit and
return to the Emperor. When the Emperor heard of Dara’s
going to Gujrat, he returned from Allahabad. On Satur-
day, the 15th January, 1659 /1st Jamad. A., while encamped
on the bank of the Ganges he learnt from Muhammad
Sultan’s despatches of the capture of Allahabad. As it
was necessary to punish Jaswant Singh, who wanted to join
Dara, he sent Muhammad Amin Khan, Mir Bakhshi, with
9,000 cavalry from Ghatampur on the 16th January /2nd
Jamad. A., to destroy him,

2.


--- Page 21 ---
10 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI [cu. 1

As the Emperor wished [18] to march without delay
for the punishment of Jaswant Singh and the suppression
of Dara, he did not go.to Agra but on Friday, the 4th
February /2lst Jamad. A., started from the garden of Nur
Manzil towards Ajmir. On the 8th/25th Jamad. A., when
he marched out of the hunting-lodge of Rupbas, Shaikh Mir
and Dilir Khan, having returned from the pursuit of Dara,
joined the Emperor.

As the return of the army was the cause of Dara’s
enjoying repose, he stepped into the wilderness and reached
Cutch and thence Gujrat. Shah Nawaz Khan Safavi, the
father of the late imperial consort Dilras Banu Begam, who
had been appointed by the Emperor Subahdar of this
province, joined Dara out of lack of spirit. Dara after
passing one month and seven days in Gujrat, gathered
together 22,000 cavalry, issued from it on Monday, the 14th
February /Ist Jamad. S., and receiving on the way Jaswant
Singh’s letters inviting him to go to Ajmir, was emboldened
to advance. On Sunday, the 20th February /7th Jamad 5.,
the Emperor encamped near Hindaun ; and no halt was made
from here to the village of Tuda. On Monday the 28th
February /15th Jamad. $., Amir Khan, brother of Shaikh
Mir, who had, by order, taken Murad Bakhsh from Delhi
fort to Gwalior, joined the Emperor.

SECOND BATTLE WITH DARA AND HIS FLIGHT

Dara Shukoh after reaching Ajmir got ready for
battle. On Wednesday, the 9th March/24th Jamad. S.,
the Emperor encamped 6 kos from the tank of Rameshwar,
pa] and there ordered the marshalling of his army
or battle. Dara strengthened by the hope of the arrival
of Jaswant Singh, acted boldly. Just then Raja Jai Singh,
taking pity on the sinful Jaswant Singh and getting his
offences pardoned through the Emperor’s graciousness,
wrote him a letter giving him the glad news of his being
pardoned and dissuading him from his wish to join Dara.
When he got it, he turned back from a distance of 20 kos
from Jodhpur. Dara urged him to come and sent his son
Sipihr Shukoh to him, but to no effect. Meantime the
imperial army had arrived near Ajmir; Dara was therefore,
compelled to set his heart on battle, but as he was not strong
enough to fight an open battle with the imperial army, he
entrenched the hill-pass of Ajmir across its breadth. The


--- Page 22 ---
1659] BATTLE OF DEORAI 11

imperial army stayed at Deordi, 8 kos from Ajmir, which
was at a short distance from Dara’s station.

Next day, the imperial army advanced half a kos and
halted. The Emperor ordered his artillery to be carried
forward to play upon the enemy. The enemy returned the
fire with cannon and musket.

That day and night and up to the 3rd prahar (quarter)
of the next day, the flame of battle raged between the two
sides. Shah Nawaz Khan Safavi, Muhammad Sharif,
[20] Mir Bakhshi of Dara Shukoh, and other leaders of his
army were slain. Among the imperialists, Shaikh Mir fell
shot through the chest with a musket-ball. But Mir
Hashim, a fellow-clansman of Shaikh Mir, who sat behind
him on the howdah of his elephant, very carefully propped
him up in his arms, so that none knew of his death till the
end of the battle. Dara beholding the heroic exertions of
the imperialists, took to flight inspite of his trenches being
still intact, and turned towards Gujrat. Such a crowning
victory adorned the country and the people. The Emperor
on hearing of it thanked God, the true Giver of Victories.

It is well-known that few kings had to fight so many
royal battles and lordly encounters in such a period, as this
Emperor had to do with powerful enemies in a single year.
But through God’s grace he achieved victory everywhere
by dint of his strong arm and sharp sword. But inspite of
his great valour and activity, so great was his humility that
he never ascribed these victories to his own powers, but
always spoke of them as miracles wrought by God, and
ever rendered his thanks to the Creator for this great good
fortune by adoration of Allah, the establishment of the
Holy Law of the Prophet, and the extinction of all traces
of illegal and prohibited practices. [21] Inspite of his
splendour and power, not for a moment did he yield up
his body to repose or slackness, but added a lustre to the
throne by his -constant vigilance, devotion to God, dis-
pensation of justice, promotion of the public happiness, and
attention to the condition of the peasantry and the soldiery
and the rules of justice and equity. I hope that the spiritual
and material worlds may always be resplendent through
the rule of this religious king. ;

Next day, Monday, the 14th March 1659/29th
Jamad S., he sent Raja Jai Singh and Bahadur Khan to
pursue Dara, and being free from anxiety on the score of


--- Page 23 ---
12 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI (cH. 1

Dara, set out on Monday, the 18th March/4th Rajab on
return from Ajmir.

A despatch from Prince Muhammad Sultan brought
the news that Shah Shuj‘a had halted for a few days in
Mungir wishing to reside there for some time, but through
fear of the approach of the imperial army had fled towards
Jahangirnagar, and Mu’azzam Khan had entered the fort
of Mungir. On Thursday, the 7th April/24th Rajab,
the Emperor reached Fathpur, and on ‘Tuesday, the
19th April/6th Shaban he started for Delhi. He learnt
from Muhammad Sultan’s despatches that Shah Shuj’a,
who had gone to Rajmahal before this, had removed his
baggage to boats when the imperial army approached that
city, and Rajmahal, too, was occupied by the imperialists.

News came that Dara after leaving Ajmir had gone to
Gujrat [=Ahmadabad] and wished to seize it a second
time, but Sardar Khan, one of the officers of the local rein-
forcements [22] opposed him, and Dara, giving up the
desire of capturing the city, fled for refuge to Kanhji Kuli.
On Monday the 2nd May, the Emperor reached the palace
of Khizirabad. A halt of eleven days was made here, and
on Thursday the 12th May/29th Shaban, he entered the
Delhi fort.

CHAPTER II

SECOND CORONATION, MAY 1659

At the first auspicious coronation celebrations had been
greatly curtailed on account of the expedition into the
Panjab and also want of leisure, the reading of the khutba,
the stamping of coins, and the proclamation of the
Emperor’s title had been postponed. Now that the work
of conquest had been completed, he ordered his officers to
make preparations for the coronation celebrations, and they
‘did their best. On Sunday, 5th June 1659/24th Ramzan,
when the Emperor was 40 years 7 months and 18 days
(solar) or 41 years 10 months and 2 days (lunar) old, he
sat on the throne. ...

[23] An eloquent khatib ascended the pulpit and read
an impressive khutbah, and he was rewarded to his heart’s
content. Such quantities of gold and silver coins were
distributed in the name of the Emperor that the wide bag
of hope was filled by picking them up. The courtiers
bowed to do honour, and sang the praises of and prayed
for the Emperor. The doors of imperial treasuries were
opened to all people ; and the expectations of all, young and
old, were fulfilled.

In former times the sacred Quranic credo (Kalma) used
to be stamped on gold and silver coins, and such coins
were constantly touched with the hands and feet of men;
Aurangzib said that it would be better to stamp some other
words on coins. At this time Mir ‘Abdul Baqi, sur-
named Suhbai, showed the following couplet of his own
composition :— .

‘King Aurangzib ‘Alamgir

Stamped coins, in the world, like the bright
full moon.’’

The Emperor liked it and ordered that one face of
mohars and rupees should be stamped with this verse and
the other with the name of the mint-city and the year of
accession (in which they would be coined).

The Emperor’s title on the grand seal was ordered to
be engraved as Abul Zafar Muhi-ud-din Muhammad
Aurangzib Bahadur ‘Alamgir Padishah Ghazi. It was


--- Page 25 ---
14 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI [oH. 2

ordered that edicts should be issued announcing the accession
and the happy news [24] of protection and happiness to all
parts of the Empire. The Emperor with openhanded
liberality gave grand rewards to the princes, begams and
imperial handmaids; every one of the nobles and faithful
servants received promotion and title according to his
rank ; pious and religious men, poets, musicians and singers
received suitable rewards and gifts.

The Emperor ordered that these entertainments should
continue on the same scale up to Friday, the 19th
August /10th Zil H., (the date of Id-uz-buha) and be joined
to the latter, so that during the whole period the desires
of the people might be gratified and their long-standing
hopes realised. Mulla Shah of Badakshan found the date
of the accession in the chronogram—Zill-al-Haq, ‘‘The
Shadow of Truth’’.

Another scholar found the date in Pdadishah-i-mulk-i-
haft-iqlim, and a third in Zeb-i-aurang wa taj-i-padishahan.
Mulla ‘Azizullah, son of Mulla Taqi of Isfahan [25] found
the chronogram in the words of God, Innal-mulk-lilla
yutiyia man yishsha,

As the Emperor’s (first) victories were gained in the
month of Ramzan, he ordered that in official records the
first day of this month should be counted as the commence-
ment of every year of his reign.

As the preceding sovereigns, following the practice of
Jamshid and Naushirwan, used to regard the first day of the
month of Farwardi as a day of great rejoicing and to
celebrate it with festivity, this pious faith-protecting
Emperor ordered that, in the place of the (Persian) new
vear’s (nauroz) celebration, an imperial festivity should be
held every year in the month of Ramzan and continued to’
the Id-ul-fitr (on the Ist Shawwal), and that this celebration
should be called the nishat-afroz jashan,.

In order to put down forbidden practices and vices,
Mulla ’Auz Wajih, the chief of the learned men, was
appointed Censor, and instead of an annual stipend of
15,000 rupees he was given the mansab of a hazari (100 tr.)
Thank God that even now, owing to the piety of the
Emperor, the whole of Hindustan is free from the filth of
innovation and heresy.

At this time the Emperor learnt from the news-letter
of Bengal that Prince Muhammad Sultan who had been
deputed with Mu’azzam Khan to crush Shuj’a, had,


--- Page 26 ---
1659] CAPTIVE DARA IN DELHI 15

through the instigation of the latter, gone away on Wednes-
day the 8th June 1659/27th Ramzan with a few servants
by boat with the intention of joining Shuj‘a and was
showing hostility to the imperial cause.

FATE OF DARA SHUKOH

On Saturday the 2nd July/21st Shawwal, news came
to Court of the capture of Dara Shukoh with his son Sipihr
Shukoh, on Friday the 10th June/29th Ramzan by Malik
Jiwan, the zamindar of Dadar and [26] of the hastening
of Bahadur Khan on receipt of the letter of the said Malik
and his taking over charge of both the prisoners. The
Amir-ul-umara was appointed Subahdar of the Deccan vice
Prince Muhammad Mu’azzam, ’Aqidat Klian was made
commandant of Daulatabad vice ’Aqil Khan, who with
Wazir Khan was ordered to come to Court in the company
of the prince. Saturday, the 2nd July, 1659/21st Shawwal,
was the 6th (solar) birthday of prince Muhammad ’Azam.
He was presented with a jewelled sarpech, a dagger with a
pearl-set strap, and five horses. Malik Jiwan was rewarded
for Dara’s capture by a robe of honour being sent him, and
the rank of a hazari (200 tr.) and the title of Bakhtiar Khan
being conferred on him. Qabil Khan Munshi wanted to
retire to seclusion; he was given an annual stipend of
5,000 rupees. Raja Rajrup was sent to the hills of
Srinagar, to hold before Prithvipat, the zamindar of that
place, hopes and fears and thus induce him to surrender
Sulaiman Shukoh. News came from Bengal that Shah
Shuj’a while going from Akbarnagar to Tanda had sus-
pected from Alawardi Khan’s actions a wish to desert him,
and had therefore slain him and his son Saifullah. At this
time an order was issued to build a Shir Haji wall around
the fort of Agra, and in three years the work was completed
under the supervision of ’Itibar Khan.

On Tuesday, the 2nd August /28rd Zil.Q., took place
the ceremony of weighing the Emperor on his 42nd lunar
birthday; gold of the Emperor’s weight was distributed
among the poor; and all men, far and near, were rendered
happy by the granting of robes, promotion of rank, and the
gift of jewels, horses, and elephants.

[27] At this time Bahadur Khan brought Data Shukoh
to the exalted Court. He was kept in the palace of
Khizirabad. As it was necessary for various reasons to


--- Page 27 ---
16 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI [cH. 2

remove the dust of his life from the plain of the world of
the living, on the night of Tuesday, the 30th August /21st
Zil.H., the lamp of his life was quenched, and he was buried
in Humayun’s tomb. Saif Khan was ordered to convey
Sipihr Shukoh to the fort of Gwalior, and then return to
Agra and be its Subahdar. Raja Jai Singh who had
lagged behind Bahadur Khan arrived at Court and was
honoured with favours. As owing to their many forced
marches the Raja and Bahadur Khan had lost many
horses, the Emperor graviously presented the Raja with
200 and the Khan with 100 horses.

At this time, according to his usual generosity the
collection of road-toll (rahdari) on the transit of grains and
other articles was abolished for ever. On this account the
Crown-lands made a sacrifice to the amount of 25 lakhs of
rupees a year; and what was given up for the whole Empire
cannot be imagined.

At this time Zulfiqar Khan Qaramanlu died. The
Emperor graciously consoled his son Asad Khan and his
son-in-law Namdar Khan by the grant of robes of honour.
Bakhtiar Khan zamindar of Dadar was sent back to his
estate. Mu’azzam Khan during. his service under Qutb-ul-
mulk had conquered the country of Karnatik; one of its
strong forts, Kanji Kota, (Gandi Kota) [28] was held by the
men of the Khan, but Qutb-ul-mulk coveted it. Mir Ahmad
Khwafi with the title of Mustafa Khan was sent to govern
this country. News came from the province of Kabul that
Sherullah [=Sher Beg], son of S’adat Khan, grandson of
Tarbiyat Khan deceased, had slain his father with a dagger.
The Emperor ordered Mahabat Khan the nazim to imprison
him, and appointed Shamshir Khan as commandant of
Kabul fort vice the murdered man.

Now came from Turan-land that love had changed into
quarrel between Subhan Quli Khan, ruler of Balkh, and
his brother Qasim Sultan, who held command of the fort
and that Subhan Quli Khan had got rid of him by clever
devices.

The going over of Prince Muhammad Sultan to Shuj’a
was a great calamity to the army in Bengal. Though the
Emperor felt reassured from Mu’azzam Khan’s commanding
the army, yet after the celebration of the weighing ceremony
at the commencement of the 41st solar year of his life,—
when the desires of the people were satiated with gifts—
he set out as a measure of precaution with the army towards


--- Page 28 ---
1659-60 ] SECOND YEAR 17

the bank of the Ganges on Sunday, the 13th Nov. /8th
Rabi.A. Raja Jai Singh was rewarded with one lakh of
rupees : Raja Jaswant Singh was pardoned and restored to
the title of Maharaja.

Mir Ibrahim, son of the late Mir Numan, was deputed
to convey articles worth 6 lakhs and 30,000 rupees to the
Sharifs of Mecca and Medina. On Thursday the 24th
November /19th Rabi.A., the Emperor reached Garhmuk-
teshwar. On Sunday the 27th/22nd Rabi. A., Prince Mu-
hammad Mu’azzam with Wazir Khan having arrived from
the Deccan, [29] had audience of the Emperor. On Tuesday
the 20th December/15th Rabi.S., the Prince was married
to a high-born lady of Khurasan. On Saturday, the 7th
January, 1660/4th Jamad.A., the Emperor marched from
Garhmukteshwar towards Allahabad. At this time a
despatch came from Mu’azzam Khan stating that he had
crossed the Ganges, determined to end the war with Shuj’a,
while Shuj’a4 had left Tanda which was his military base
for Dacca. As the real object of this march of the Emperor
was to strengthen the army of Bengal, and as his mind was
quieted about that affair, he returned from [Mau] Sham-
sabad towards Delhi, the fort of which he entered on
Monday, the 13th February, 1660/11th Jamad.s.

As it was the pious Emperor’s intention to offer obli-
gatory prayers in congregation, by the side of his retiring
place, he laid the foundation of a small mosque of marble
with carvings of plants and fret-work of various kinds. It
was completed in the space of 5 years at an expenditure of
one lakh and 60,000 rupees. ’Aqil Khan found the chrono-
gram in the holy verse, Innal-masajid-illa fala tad‘ua-
ma‘-allah.

At this time news came from Bengal that prince
Muhammad Sultan [80] at the time of Shuj’4’s flight to
Dacca had repented of his conduct, come back to Akbar-
nagar in the same way that he had left it, and joined Islam
Khan. Muhammad Mirak, macebearer, carried to him a
robe with rarities from the Emperor, and Fidai Khan was
ordered to bring the Prince to Court. When he arrived
near the capital, Alah Yar Khan went forward on Thurs-
day, the 26th April, 1660/25th Shaban, and conveyed
him by water to Salimgarh, his custody being given to
Mu’atamad Khan. /

CHAPTER III
THIRD YEAR OF REIGN: (1070 4.8.)

Ist May, 1660—19th April, 1661

Now began the month of Ramzan. On Thursday, the
24th May, 1660/24th Ramzan, 1070 A.H., a charming and
grand assembly was held, and joyous music was played.

On this auspicious day news came from Bengal that
Shuj’d, unable to make a stand at Dacca, had fled to Arakan,
on Sunday, the 6th May/6th Ramzan and that Mu’azzam
Khan had entered Dacca.

It had been ordered that the celebrations should begin
on the 24th Ramzan, the date of the 2nd accession, and be
carried on to the ‘Id-ul-fitr. During this period all officers
of the Court far and near, great and small, were [31]
gratified with gifts by the Emperor. On the morning of
the "Id day the Emperor went to the mosque, and for two
days after the Id the festivities and banquets were continued.

I shall now leave the account of the incidents of the
Court, but this small book cannot hold even an abridged
history of the occurrences of Bengal and the exertions of
the imperial army, which had been deputed from Allahabad
in January 1659 under the leadership of Prince Muhammad
Sultan and Mu’azzam Khan in pursuit of Shuj’4. There-
fore I give up the attempt to describe this affair in detail.
Suffice it to say that the march of the imperial army put
Shuj’a to such hard straits that none could hold with him
save Sayyid ‘Alam Badah-kash, one of the Sayyids of
Barha, and Sayyid Quli Uzbak with twelve Mughals and a
few other men, After traversing calamitous regions, he
reached the most villainous island of Arakan where he was
entrapped in the snare of that land of infidels. His fate will
be narrated in the proper place.

On Sunday, the 15th July, 1660/17th Zil. Q., the
Emperor was weighed on his 44th lunar birthday. The
people were rewarded. The princes received many kinds
of favour. Mu’azzam Khan [82], the general in Bengal,
was given the high titles of Khan-i-Khanan and Sipahsalar
and the rank of a 7 hazari, (7 hazar dodspa and sehaspa) ;
a robe and a jewelled sword were sent to him in reward of


--- Page 30 ---

his suppression of Shuj’a. All kinds of reward and favour
were bestowed on the commanders of the army sent to
Bengal and on the viceroys and courtiers.

Najabat Khan who for some offences had incurred the
imperial wrath, now got his pardon, came unarmed and was
cherished with the gift of a sword. Mansur, brother of the
Kashghar chief ‘Abdullah Khan and Mahdi, the brother’s
son of the Khan, who in fear of him had come to India
by way of Badakhshan had audience and entered the
imperial service. Presents from the Begam Sahib and
other begams and princes, consisting of jewels and jewelled
ware, were presented to the Emperor and accepted. At the
joyous ’Id-uz-zuha/7th August 1660, royal gifts were
bestowed on vast numbers of people. 1

Rao Karn Bhurtia [of Bikanir], at Dara’s instigation
had come home from the Deccan without permission. Amir
Khan was now sent to that quarter to take the frightened
and humiliated man with himself if he begged pardon,
otherwise to boldly extirpate him. When the Khan reached
the frontier of Bikanir, the Rao came and waited on him
and through the Khan’s intercession was introduced to the
forgiving Emperor and received gifts.

On Sunday, 2nd September/7th Muharram [33],
Ikhlas Khan Khweshgi, who brought the treasures, jewels,
other effects and women of Shuj’4 from Bengal, had
audience. At this time the fort of Chakna situated in Konkan
was conquered by the Amir-ul-umara, viceroy of the
Deccan, who had been sent out to put down the wicked Shiva
and to capture his strong places, which he had seized owing
to changes (decay) in the Bijapur administration and the
slaughter of Afzal, the Bijapuri leader. The Khan after
properly punishing Shiva’s men, established outposts in
some places.

At this time took place the festivity of the weighing of
the Emperor on his 48rd solar birthday and vast numbers
of men were gratified with favours.

At this time Parenda was captured without a blow.
Ghalib, the ’Adil Shahi commandant of the fort, proposed
to the Amir-ul-umara the surrender of the fort, with a view
to entering the imperial service. The Amirulumara_ sent
Mukhtar Khan as qil’adar and summoned Ghalib to himself,
and on behalf of the Emperor gave him the rank of 4 hazari,
the title of Khan and other rewards. At this time Prithvi
Singh, zamindir of the Srinagar hills, wrote a letter to Raja

Jai Singh begging pardon for his offences and offering to
surrender Sulaiman Shukoh. At the Raja’s request, his
son Kumar Ram Singh was given leave to depart for
bringing away Sulaiman, and he brought him to Delhi on
Thursday, the 27th December, 1660/5th Jamad. A. He
was kept in Salimgarh. On Tuesday, the 15th Jan.
1661/24th Jamad. A. Murtaza Khan conveyed him and
prince Muhammad Sultan to Gwalior and entrusted them
to Mu‘atamad Khan, its qiladar.

When the Emperor learnt from the news-letters of the
port of Surat [84] that Husain Pasha, governor of Basra,
had sent with his servant Qasim Aqa, a letter of congratula-
tion on his accession with horses of the Persian breed for the
Emperor, an order was issued on Mustafa Khan collector
(mutasaddi) of the port of Surat to give Qasim Aqa 4,000
rupees for his expenses, and send him to the Court. At
this time Ibrahim Beg, envoy of Subhan Quli Khan ruler
of Balkh, arrived at Court with a special letter and presents
of Turan-land. As he had an old ailment, he died in a few
days; his companions were given robes and 20,000 rupees
and sent away.

As famine appeared in many places of the Empire, it
was ordered that in addition to the permanent alms-houses
ten more should be opened in Delhi and twelve others in
the parganals around it for the relief of the poor. Similar
arrangements were made in Lahore. In addition to the
amounts customarily spent in the months of Muharram,
Rajab, Sha‘ban, Ramzan, Rabi‘-ul-awwal, and Zilhijj, this
year double the amount was distributed. Orders were issued
to the grandees down to commanders of a thousand that they
should practise charity on their own account, and this alms-
giving continued until the scarcity was turned into plenty.

CHAPTER IV
FOURTH YEAR OF THE REIGN. (1071 A.H.)

20 April 1661—9 April 1662

With the month of Ramzan [85] began the 4th year
of the reign. The 24th of Ramzan was the anniversary of
the Coronation, and last year the celebrations began on that
date. But as owing to the fast the people had no liking
for entertainment, the commencement of this celebration
was postponed to the day of ‘Id (1st Shawwal) and it was
given a duration of ten days. A son was born to Prince
Muhammad Mu’azzam, and named Sultan Muhammad
Mui‘zuddin.

The Emperor learnt that Budaq Beg, ambassador of
Shah ’Abbads II, king of Persia, had entered Multan on
Friday, the 19th ‘April, 1661 /29th Shaban. Tarbiyat Khan,
the Subahdar, had entertained him hospitably and presented
him with 5,000 rupees and nine pieces of cloth. At Lahore
Khalilullah Khan very hospitably treated him and gave him
20,000 rupees, an enamelled sword and dagger, and seven
pieces of cloth from among the rarities of India. When he
arrived at Sarai Baoli, food from the Emperor’s own table
was sent to him, and he was ordered to have audience on the
22nd May /3rd Shawwal.

When the month of Shawwal began, preparations were
made for the royal festivities, as ordered before. The
Emperor went to the ‘Idgah. (20th May 1661, ‘Id-ul-fitr.)
After his return from that place he engaged in gratifying
the desires of the world : the Princes, nobles, Rajas, amirs,
all received rewards and gifts beyond their desire.

Qasim Aqa Rumi at interview presented five Arab
horses as an offering from Husain Pasha [36], and some
horses and Georgian slaves also on his own account. He was
favoured with a robe and 5,000 rupees. When Budaq Beg,
envoy of Persia, came to the outskirts of Delhi, on the 3rd
day from the ‘Id, 22nd or 23rd May, Asad Khan, Saif Khan
and Multafat Khan conducted him from outside the city to
the Presence. The interview was ordered to take place in
the Hall of Audience. After bowing he presented the Shah’s
letter of congratulation on the Emperor’s accession. A robe,


--- Page 33 ---
22 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI [cx. 4

a turban-jewel (jigha), a jewelled dagger, a festive argaja
with a gold cup and saucer, and betels with a gold betel-
casket and tray, were presented to him. The mansion of
Rustam Khan was assigned for his residence, and Mir ’Aziz
Badakhshi as his care-taker. On Sunday the 26th May /7th
Shawwal, the Shah’s presents were offered to the Emperor ;
these included 66 horses, one round pearl weighing 37 carat,
and these were valued in all at four lakh and 22,000 rupees.

On Saturday the 6th July, 1661/19th Zil. Q., the
Emperor was weighed on his 45th lunar birthday, in the
customary way; all people, great and small, at Court and
in the provinces received presents. On Saturday, the 27th
July /10th Zil, H., the "Id-uz-zuha took place. The Emperor
gave conge to the Persian envoy, with a reward of one lakh
of rupees, robes, an enamelled dagger, with a pearl strap,
a horse with gold saddle and bridle, an elephant with gold
litter and silver trappings, a gold-embroidered housing, one
dariai elephant, and a palki with gold trappings. It was
stated that a reply to the Shah’s letter would be soon [37]
sent. From first to last 5 lakhs of rupees were bestowed on
the ambassador and 35 thousand rupees on his companions.
*Aqil Khan begged permission to go into retirement; an
annual subsistence of 9,000 rupees was settled on him.

The Emperor was weighed on his 44th solar birthday,
and conferred favours on all. Qasim Aqa, an officer of Husain
Pasha, was sent back with 12,000 rupees and a robe, and
his companions got 1,000 rupees; a jewelled sword was sent
for the Pasha.

On Sunday, the 17th November /4th Rabi. S., Khwaja
Ahmad, son of Khwaja Khawand Mahmud, envoy of ’Abdul,
"Aziz Khan the ruler of Bukhara, arrived in the environs of
Delhi. Saif Khan advancing conducted him to the Emperor.
He presented a letter and gifts consisting of roadster Turki
horses, large two-humped male and female camels and other
things, one of which being a ruby worth 24,000 rupees. The
Emperor graciously gave him that day a robe, a dagger with
a pearl strap, 20,000 rupees and a mansion to stay in.

At this time the daughter of Raja Rup Singh, who had
been converted to Islam and brought up in the imperial
harem, was married to Prince Muhammad Mu’azzam. The
details of this splendid ceremony can be learnt from the
honoured book (‘Alamgirnamah) * * ¥* *

As Daud Khan the Subahdar of Patna, [88] had by
hard fight conquered the country of Palamau, a dependency


--- Page 34 ---
1662] FOURTH YEAR 23

of the province of Bihar, a robe of honour was sent to him.
Sayyid Amir Khan, was made Subahdar of Kabul vice
Mahabat Khan.

On Monday, the 10th February /Ist Rajab, Fazil Khan
came from Agra and presented some jewels and jewelled
ware sent by Shah Jahan. On the 11th news came that
Khalilullah Khan, Subahdar of Lahore, who had arrived
sick at Delhi, had died. The second day from his death,
the Emperor visited the house of his surviving relatives, and
favoured Mir Khan, Ruhullah Khan, and ’Azizullah, his
sons and other relatives with robes. An annual stipend of
50,000 rupees was granted to his widow, Hamida Banu,
daughter of Malika Banu, the sister of Mumtaz-uz-zamani.

On Saturday, the 15th February, 1662/6th Rajab,
Prince Muhammad Akbar was circumcised. Khwaja
Ahmad, envoy of Bukhara, was given his conge with a robe,
a jewelled dagger with pearl strap, and 30,000 rupees as
reward. From first to last one lakh and 20,000 rupees were
viven to this envoy. On Wednesday, the 12th March / Ist
Shaban, eighty elephants of Shuj‘a, sent by the Khan-i-
Khanan and two elephants from the spoils of Palamau were
presented to the Emperor. ’

How can I describe fully the hunting in which His
Majesty often delighted ? I give a little as a sample of much :
This year 150 kulangs (large cocks or herons) were struck
down by the royal falcons. There was also a hunt, in which
355 deer were driven into the net; eight ‘of these deer [39}
were brought down by the Emperor and 47 others by the
party that had been given permission to hunt in the enclosure
into which the game had been driven. The rest were ordered
to be released. The Emperor was informed that at first
many deer had come within the circle of the gqamurgha, but
in fright they fell upon the beaters (ahal-i-qamurgha) in
a large body, five men were gored with horns and two men
were killed. About a thousand deer escaped.

A curious incident was now reported to the Emperor ;
at the village of Sonepat a party of boys played at king and
ministers, two of them were chargéd (in play) with theft and
taken by the policeman to the king, who ordered punish-
ment. This senseless (mock) policeman hit the two on the
head with the stick he carried in his hand so hard that they
were killed, and this game proved fatal.

ACCOUNT OF THE CONQUEST OF KUCH BIHAR AND ASSAM

Towards the end of the year 1657 A.D./1067 A.H.,
owing to the illness of Shah Jahan, disturbances broke out
in all the frontiers, Bhim [=Pran] Narain, zamindar of
Kuch Bihar occupied the Kamrup district, appertaining to
the imperial dominions. Just then Jayadhwaj Singh, Raja
of Assam, who considered his country safe from the inroad
of the imperial army and wanted to conquer the aforesaid
district deputed a large army by the land-route to the
district, [40] of Kamrup.

The Khan-i-Khanan, knowing the invasion of these two
countries to be urgent, started from Khizrpur by order of
the Emperor, on Friday the Ist November, 1661/18th
Rabi. A. His army occupied the city of Kuch Bihar on
Thursday, the 19th Dec./7th Jamad. A., and named it,
‘Alamgir-nagar. On Thursday, the 9th January, 1662/
28th Jamad. A., the army set out for the conquest of Assam
by way of Ghoraghat. After campaigning for five months,
the Islamic standard was planted in Garhgaon, the capital
of Assam, on Monday, the 17th March/6th Shaban. I
cannot describe in detail what the ‘Alamgirnamah gives
fully, namely, the great designs of the faithful army, their
exertions and hardships in this campaign through extreme
devotion and fidelity to the Emperor, the capture of count-
less spoils consisting of all kinds of things, money and other
articles, nor describe here the wonders, rarities, strange
things, and precious objects of Kuch Bihar and Assam
comprising the inanimate and animate creation, the varieties
of trees, fruits, and plants, plains and rivers, food and
dress, forts and houses of these countries. ,

When the Emperor learnt the details of this famous
victory from the despatches of the Khan-i-Khanan, he
graciously gave the Khan’s son Muhammad Amin Khan
who was then at Court, a robe and sent a farman full of
praise, a special robe, tuman tugh, and a reward of 1 kror of
dam (Rs. 2% lakhs) to the faithful Khan. [41]

CHAPTER V
FIFTH YEAR OF THE REIGN (1072 A.H.)

10th April 1662—29th March 1663

The month of Ramzan was spent in the performance of
the appointed religious duties. The fifth year of the reign
began. The imperial officers set about preparing for the
festivities and fireworks in the manner of previous years.
On the day of ’Id 10th May, the Emperor after returning
from the mosque conferred gifts and rewards on the cour-
tiers, commanders in all places, and the amirs in the subahs ;
tributes were offered to and accepted by him.

On Monday the 12th May, 1662, the Emperor declined
in health. Too much blood-letting caused weakness and
swooning. This continued till Tuesday, the 17th June/10th
Zil. Q., when Hakim Muhammad Amin and Hakim Mahdi
tried the best remedies. Alms were given for removing the
disease and relieving the needs of the poor. On Tuesday,
the 24th June/17th Zil. Q., he took the bath of recovery.
On Tuesday, the 17th July/10th Zil. H, (Id-uz-zuha) he
went to the place of prayer; great and small, rich and poor
on seeing him enjoyed a double ‘Id. On Wednesday, the
23rd July /17th Zil. H. he was weighed on his 46th lunar
birth-day.

Mahabat Khan was made subahdar of Gujrat vice
Maharaja Jaswant Singh, and promoted to be a 6 hazari (5
hazdar tr.). On his coming back from a life of retirement,
Razavi Khan Bukhari was created a 2,500 zat (400 tr.)
[42] The officers of ‘Adil Khan who had brought his
tribute were dismissed with robes. Tagarrab Khan died.
His son Muhammad ‘Ali Khan, who too had been removed
from his rank for his father’s offences, was graciously pre-
sented with a mourning robe and the rank of 1,500 (200 tr.).
Saif Khan, who had retired, came from Sirhind and received
a robe, and a sword, and the rank of two hazari (1,50% ‘r.).

On Tuesday, the 2nd December, 1662/1st Jam:
the Emperor was weighed on his 45th solar birth:
men received gifts according to their desires.

Khan who had been punished for some offence ir

year, was again created a 5 hasavi (4,000 tr.). On Monday,
the 8th December /7th Jamad. A. the Emperor started for
Lahore. At Karnal Fazil Khan, Mir-i-Saman, was sent to
proceed with the surplus camp-followers and baggage by
the direct route to Lahore, while the Emperor advanced
hunting in the direction of Mukhlispur, and reached
Lahore on Sunday the 8th February, 1663/10th Rajab. As
it was the imperial wish to visit Kashmir, he sent Khidmat-
var Khan to make roads. On Friday the 18th February /
15th Rajab, Qutbuddin Khan Khweshgi, faujdar of Juna-
gath, slew the wicked Rai Singh, uncle of Chhatra Sal,
zamindar of the country of Jam, who had raised dis-
turbances and had dispossessed his nephew after the death
of the latter’s father Rai Mal [=Ran Mal] with one son,
an uncle and other relatives, numbering in all 300 men.
[43] The Emperor ordered the country to be named Islam-
nagar, in recognition of the bravery of the Khan,

TIIK CONCLUSION OF THE AFFAIRS OF ASSAM

When the Khan-i-Khanin took up his residence at
Mathurapur for passing the rainy season and water covered
the whole land, the Assamese began to act boldly. As the
Mughal troops could not ride out, the audacity
of the Assamese passed all limits. Their Raja too came
down from the hills of Namrup. The Mughal outposts
were withdrawn; no other place than Garhgaon and
Mathuraipur remained in the possession of the imperialists.
Provisions were exhausted. The poisonous air caused
a pestilence which carried off vast numbers. This affected
the whole land of Assam, and vast crowds of the enemy,
too, in the hills went to hell. During this period the food
of the soldiers and the cattle was rice and beef, large
quantities of which had been captured from the enemy.
‘There was no alternative but to wait patiently for the end
of the rains. In the middle [of the month of Safar /mid
September] the rains decreased and boats of provisions too
arrived at that time.

By the end of Rabi-ul-awwal, as the land reappeared,
the Mughals sallied forth on all sides and made a terrible
slaughter of the enemy in the same way as before. The
Raja fled to the hills, and made overtures of peace, but the
Khan did not agree and started for Namrup,


--- Page 38 ---
1663] FIFTH YEAR 27

In the meantime many acute diseases attacked the
Khan. The soldiers, worn out with labour and sufferings,
were shaken in mind by the fear of his dying in such a
(terrible) country and wished [44] to desert him, and go
back to Bengal. , The Khan on learning of it was grieved
and on Friday the 5th December, 1662/4th Jamad. A. he
advanced one stage. Necessity now compelled him to decide
on peace and return. The Raja, who saw his own capture
imminent, made Dilir Khan his mediator, and the latter
induced the Khan-i-Khanan to agree to the Raja’s proposal.

On Monday the 5th January, 1663/5th Jamad. S., the
agents of the Raja arrived, and brought to the imperial
camp a tribute of 20,000 tolahs of gold, 1 lakh and 8 thou-
sand tolahs of silver, 20 elephants for the Emperor, 15 for
the Klan-i-Khanan, and 5 for Dilir Khan, as well as the
daughter of the Raja, the daughter of another Raja of a part
of the country of Assam (a near relative of the chief Raja),
four sons of the nobles of the Raja’s Court (who were to stay
in Bengal as hostages for the arrival of the balance of the
tribute, i.e., what had been promised over and above what
was now delivered.)

On Saturday, the 10th January /10th Jamad. S., the
Khan-i-Khanan, marched from the mouth of the Namrup
hill and returned towards Bengal, arriving at Lakhugarh
on Thursday, the 22nd /22nd Jamad. S. ; on Wednesday, the
llth February/13th Rajab he marched out of Kajli and
arrived at Pandu opposite Gauhati on the further side of
the river, sending away Rashid Khan as faujdar of Kamrup.
At this time his illness became past remedy. When he
found himself in this plight, he deputed ‘Askar Khan to
reconquer Kuch Bihar, which Bhim [ =Pran]| Narayan had
recovered, and himself started for Khizrpur. On 31st Marchi
1663 /2nd Ramzan, he died within 2 kos of Khizrpur. [45]


--- Page 39 ---
CHAPTER VI
SIXTH YEAR OF THE REIGN. 1078 A.H.

30th March, 1663—18th March 1664 .

On Thursday, the 28rd April, 1663/25th Ramzan, the
Court officers made preparations for the celebration of the
coronation anniversary in the Dilkasha garden situated on
the other bank of the Ravi. The Emperor, starting on that
day for the trip to Kashmir, halted in the garden. That very
day the news of the Khan-i-Khanan’s death arrived. Prince
Muhammad Mu’azzam went to the house of Muhammad
Amin Khan and conducted him to the Emperor, who
consoled him with a robe. The ’Id prayer (29th April) was
performed in the chapel of the camp. Princes and nobles,
of the Court and the provinces, received favours.

On Friday, the Ist May/3rd Shawwal the Emperor
resumed his journey. One of the occurrences of this period
was the night attack of the infernal Shiva on the camp of
the Amir-ul-umara, the cutting off of his forefinger during
the encounter, and the slaughter of his son Abul Fath Khan.
As this incident was due to the negligence of this premier
noble, the Emperor punished him by transferring him from
the viceroyalty of the Deccan (which was given to prince
Muhammad Mu’azzam) to that of Bengal vice the deceased
Mu‘azzam Khan. On Tuesday, the 14th May/14th
Shawwal, the Emperor reached Bhimbar, which is the gate-
way to Kashmir. As during his stay in Lahore the snow
in the Pir Panjal route had disappeared, the imperial party
was to proceed by it. It was ordered that Raja Jai Singh
and Najabat Khan [46] should stay on the banks of the
river Chenab with the surplus camp-followers. Tahir Khan
was permitted to depart to his jagir with some other amirs.
Saf Shikan was ordered to stay at the foot of the pass of
Bhimbar with a party in order to guard the mouth of the
hills. Some nobles and servants attended on the Emperor,
while Muhammad Amin Khan and Fazil Khan were to come
three stages behind the imperial party.

On Thursday, the 14th May/16th Shawwal, he
marched out of Bhimbar. While crossing the terrible Pir
Panjal pass a frightened elephant turned back from the


--- Page 40 ---
1663] ROYAL VISIT 10 KASHMIR 29

front and stampeded towards Bhimbar like a sudden calamity
or a whirlwind; a terrible confusion befell the men and
animals in that narrow pass. Some female elephants and
some porters of the government fell into the pit of destruc-
tion and were so thoroughly crushed by the attack of this
moving mountain that not to the speak of the men, not a
bone of the elephants could be seen. On the occurrence of
this terrible accident, the heart of the humble-cherishing
Emperor was greatly grieved, and from that very time he
resolved never again to visit Kashmir. In short, on Thurs-
day, the 28th May/Ist Zil. Q., he entered the city of
Srinagar. Raja Raghunath, mutasaddi (Superintendent) of
the revenue department, died. On Sunday, the 7th June/
11th Zil. Q., the post of Wazir was entrusted to Fazil Khan,
Iftikhar Khan becoming Khan-i-Saman.

During the reign of Shah Jahan, every year 79,000
rupees were distributed in five months through the Sadr-us-
Sadur, but in the other seven months no expenditure was
made (on charity). Now the Emperor ordered that during
five months the existing practice should be followed, and
during the remaining seven months 10,000 rupees were to
be distributed every month so that in all every year one
lakh (a7 and 49,000 rupees were to be spent on the needy.

On Saturday, the 13th June/17th Zil. Q., the Emperor
was weighed on his 47th lunar birthday ; presents were given
to all the nobles of the Court and the provinces. Fazil Khan,
on obtaining the post of Diwan fell severely ill and died.
On Tuesday, the 28rd June/27th Zil. Q., the Emperor
condoled with his brother’s son Burhanuddin who
had recently come from Persia, by presenting him with a
robe and kindly undertook to bring him up.

After enjoying the scenery of all the places of Kashmir,
he set out from that abode of pleasure on the 16th August /
22nd Muharram on return towards Tahore. J’afar Khan,
Subahdar of Malwa, was summoned to Court to receive the
Wazirship, Najabat Khan being appointed in his place. The
Emperor reached Lahore on Tuesday, the 29th September /
7th Rabi. A. On Monday, the 2nd November /11th Rabi.
S., he was weighed on his 46th solar birthday. ‘Aqil Khan
who was living in retirement at Lahore, was again taken into
service as a two hazari (700 tr.). Tarbiyat Khan was sent to
Iranland as envoy to carry a reply to the letter of Shah
‘Abbas brought by Budaq Beg, with precious things and
rarities worth seven lakhs of rupees. On the 9th November,


--- Page 41 ---
30 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRi [cx. 6

the Emperor started for Delhi. J‘afar Khan had audience at
Panipat, and was created Wazir. On Friday the 20th
November /29th Rabi. S., the Emperor arrived in the
environs of Delhi. [48]

CHAPTER VII
SEVENTH YEAR OF THE REIGN: 1074 A.H.

18th March 1664—7th March 1665

With the approach of Ramzan, festive arrangements
were made. After returning from the mosque, the Emperor
sat on the throne and gratified with his royal gifts the
hearts of the princes and nobles, the rich and the poor.
Presents were made to him and accepted.

On Sunday, the 5th June/21st Zil. Q., he was weighed
on his 48th lunar birthday. A letter was received from
Prince Muhammad Mu‘azzam reporting the birth of a son
to the mother of Muhammad Mu‘izuddin; the child was
named ‘Izzuddin. Mustafa Khan Khafi was sent as envoy to
Turan-land. A letter composed by Danishmand’ Khan
along with certain rare jewelled ware worth one lakh 50,000
rupees was sent with him to ‘Abdul ‘Aziz Khan, ruler of
Bukhara, and another letter with presents worth one lakh of
rupees to Subhan Quli Khan, ruler of Balkh.

Although Maharaja Jaswant Singh greatly exerted
himself to root out Shiva, to desolate his country, and to
conquer his forts, yet no result. satisfactory to the imperial-
ists was produced. Therefore, Raja Jai Singh was appointed
with other famous commanders to put him down. On Friday,
the 80th September, 1664/19th Rabi. A., the Emperor was
weighed on his 47th solar birthday; imperial favours were
conferred on the princes and nobles.

The Emperor learnt that Najabat Khan Subahdar of
Malwa had died; Wazir Khan Subahdar of Khandesh was
appointed to succeed him [49] and Daud Khan one of the
assistants of Raja Jai Singh, was made Subahdar of
Khandesh ; but a farmdn was sent to him to leave one of his
kinsmen at Burhanpur and himself set out for his destina-
tion [the Maratha country].

A letter was received from Prince Muhammad Mu‘azzam
reporting the birth of a son on Monday, the 5th December,
1664 /26th Jamad. A., to the daughter of Rup Singh Rathor ;
the child was named Sultan Muhammad ‘Azim,

CHAPTER VIII
EIGHTH YEAR OF THE REIGN: 1075 A.H.

8th March, 1665—24th February, 1666

With the month of Ramzan began the 8th year of the
reign. Preparations for the celebration were made. After
returning from the mosque on the ‘Id-ul-fitr the Emperor
gratified the hearts of all with many acts of goodness and
favour.

Haji Ahmad Sayyid, who in the fourth year of the
reign had been sent to convey six lakh and 60,000 rupees
worth of presents to the Holy Cities, now (on return) had
audience, and presented 14 Arab horses as peshkash
(offering). Sayyid Yahia, envoy of the Sharif of Mecca
was granted an interview and presented a supplicatory letter,
three Arab horses and some sacred relics. He was rewarded
with a robe and 6,000 rupees. Siddi Kamil, envoy of the
king of Abyssinia, and Sayyid ‘Abdullah, representative
of the ruler of Hazramaut (in Arabia), arrived at Court with
letters and presents; they were shown high honour by the
grant of robes and cash. Nine Arab steeds which Imam [501
Ism‘ail, ruler of Yemen, had sent were presented to the
Emperor. This celebration continued for five days.

News reached the Court that ‘Itibar Khan, com-
mandant of Agra, had died. R‘adandaz Khan, faujdar of
the environs (of Agra) succeeded him, while the latter’s
office was given to Hushdar Khan, the Subahdar.

On Saturday, the 18th May, 1665/8th Zil. Q., Maha-
raja Jaswant Singh came from the Deccan and had audience.

On Sunday, the 23rd April/17th Shawwal, the
Emperor was weighed on his 49th lunar birthday; imperial
gifts and honours glorified the servants at Court and the
provinces. The envoys of Mecca, Abyssinia and Hazramaut
were given conge, after being presented with suitable
rewards in cash and kind. On Wednesday, the 14th June/
10th Zil. H., was the ‘Id-uz-zuha. On Friday, the 23rd
occurred the festival of ‘Id-i-Gulabi, when the princes and
nobles presented jewelled or enamelled goblets.

The Emperor learnt that, through the exertions of
Raja Jai Singh, Dilir Khan, and other heroes, Purandar,

Rudramal, and other forts of Shiva were captured, and the
latter knowing that his end would be extirpation, had very
prudently sent messengers to the Raja to beg for safety,
and having been freed from despair by the Raja’s promise
and agreement [51] had surrendered twenty-three forts to
the imperial officers. On Monday, the 12th June, 1665 /8th
Zil. H., he came unarmed and interviewed the Raja, who
embraced and made him sit near him, promised him safety
of life and property, and presenting a jewelled sword and
dagger urged him to put on the arms, and then sent him
to Dilir Khan, who too treated him with many favours. In
the terms of the Raja’s request, a farman was sent to him
(Shiva) containing pardon and a gracious robe from the
Emperor. His son Sambha was made a five hazdri (same
tr.). The Raja Jai Singh was made a seven hazari (same
tr. do-aspa seh-aspa) in recognition of his excellent services.
His son, Ram Singh, who was at Court, Dilir Khan, Daud
Khan, Rai Singh, Kirat Singh and others too received many
kinds of favour. As ‘Adil Khan of Bijapur had delayed in
paying his tribute and tried to help Shiva, an imperial order
was sent to Raja Jai Singh saying that, after settling the
country and forts gained from Shiva, he should hasten to
attack the Bijapur territory and destroy the enemy without
engaging himself in the siege of the fort. Muhammad
Zahid, son of Qazi Islam, was appointed Censor of the
Court. The high minister J‘afar Khan had built a nice
mansion on the bank of the Jamuna. The Emperor visited
it and that premier noble performed the etiquette of spread-
ing the carpet before the door (pa-andaz), supplication (niaz)
and offered valuable presents consisting of rarities and
wonderful articles. This year a reply to the letter of
‘Abdullah Khan, ruler of Kashghar [52] was sent with
Khwaja Ishaq along with certain precious articles.

On Wednesday, the 25th October, 1665 /25th Rabi. S.,
the Emperor was weighed on his 48th solar birthday; pre-
sents were given to-the nobles at Court and the provinces.
At the request of Raja Jai Singh, a farmdn was issued
summoning Mulla Ahmad Nav4yet, the chief noble of ‘Adil
Khan, who had come to the Raja to promote the interests of
his master, and being desirous of entering the imperial
service was waiting for an opportunity to do it. He was
granted the rank of a 6-hazari (same tr.).

On Saturday, 9th December/11th Jamad. S., the
Emperor learnt from the despatches of Saif Khan, Subahdar

5

of Kashmir, that in accordance with the imperial order
Daldal Muhamal,,* zamindar of Greater Tibet, had accepted
Islam, the khutba had been read in the Emperor’s name in
the country, imperial coins issued and a high mosque built
there. The Khan who had wisely managed this affair was
rewarded with a promotion of rank and the grant of a robe.
Murad Khan, a zamindar of Lesser Tibet, who had shown
great friendliness in this expedition was given a robe of
honour.

On Wednesday, the 3rd January, 1666/7th Rajab,
Prince Muhammad Mu‘azzam, having come from the
Deccan, had audience. News came from the Deccan that
Mulla Ahmad Navayet, who had started for the Court, had
died. An order was issued to send his son Asad and the
other surviving members of his family to His Majesty.
[53] From the letters of news-reporters in Agra it was
learnt that Shah Jahan was seized with strangury on the
8th January, 1666/12th Rajab and that his illness was
increasing in severity, and the doctors had withdrawn their
hands from applying remedies as they declared the disease
to be beyond cure. The Emperor wished to march in that
direction. As a measure of precaution, Prince Muhammad
Mu‘azzam was sent in advance on Friday, the 19th January /
23rd Rajab. Early in the night of Monday, the 22nd
January, 1666 A.D./26th Rajab, Shah Jahan succumbed to
the disease and gave up the ghost. On the occurrence of
this tragic event, R‘adandaz Khan, Khwaja Phul (Bahlol),
Sayyid Muhammad Kanauji and Qazi Qurban entered the
Ghusalkhana at the wish of Begam Sahib [Jahanara] and
engaged in making the necessary preparations for the
funeral and the burial. The corpse was carried out of the
fort through the door of the octangular (musamman) tower.
Hushdar Khan Subahdar, joined (the procession), took the
coffin across the Jamuna, and carried it to the mausoleum
of Mumtaz-uz-zamani built by His late Majesty. After
reading the funeral prayer, they consigned the body to the
earth under the dome. The chronograms for the death of
Shah Jahan are ‘‘Shah Jahan died’’, and ‘‘Raziullah’’ (by
Ashraf Khan). He had lived 76 years and 3 months, and
reigned 31 years and 2 months. The prince got the news
at a distance of 7 kos at the end of the night of his decease.

* Daldal is a misreading for Dalai. Muhamal does not resemble any of
the titles of the ruler of Tibet, and I can only conjecture that it is a mistake
for Mahamuni


--- Page 46 ---
1666] AFTER SHAH JAHAN’S DEATH 35

Early in the day of burial he arrived at the city and
performed the ceremony of condolence. [54] On the arrival
of the sad news, the Emperor, the Princes and the Begams
put on mourning. It was ordered that in letters and edicts
Shah Jahan’s title should be given as Firdaus Ashiani. On
Sunday, the 4th February/9th Shab‘an the Emperor
started by boat towards Agra in order to visit his father’s
tomb. On Friday, the 23rd/28th Shab‘an, he alighted at
the mansion of Dara Shukoh, and visited the tomb. The
next day and the day following he went to the fort and
made kind inquiries of and gave solace to the Begam Sahib
and all the other ladies of the harem, and made them all
quit their robes of mourning. For certain works it was
necessary for him to stay (in Agra) for a few days; so he
summoned the ladies of his harem from Delhi.

At this time the fort of Chatgaon was conquered
through the efforts of the Amir-ul-umara; his son Buzurg
Ummed Khan and other commanders were honoured and
gladdened with many favours.

CHAPTER IX
NINTH YEAR OF THE REIGN (1076 a.H.)
25th February, 1666—14th February, 1667

With the month of Ramzan began the ninth year of
the reign. The Court was decorated for the ’Id. On
Tuesday, the 27th March/1st Shawwal, joyous music was
played. After returning from the place of prayer, the
Emperor ‘sat on the throne. The Begam Sahib was given
a reward of one lakh of gold coins, and her annual pension,
formerly 12 lakhs of rupees, was increased by five lakhs
of rupees. [55] Pur Hunar Banu Begam and Gauharara
Begam each received one lakh of rupees.

At this time the imperial treasury, which the officers
had in the fifth year of the reign removed from Agra fort
to Delhi fort, was again transferred to Agra. As Raja Jai
Singh had sent Shiva to the Court and the latter had
arrived in the environs of Agra, Kumar Ram Singh and
Mukhlis Khan were ordered to advance and meet him and
bring him to His Majesty. On Saturday, the 12th May,
1666/18th Zil. Q., the Emperor was weighed on his 50th
lunar birthday. Shiva with his son Sambha was honoured
with an audience. He presented 1500 ashrafi as nazar and
6,000 rupees as nisav. As Raja Jai Singh had sent Shiva
at his request to the Court, the Emperor overlooking his
former offences wished to confer on him favours and give
him permission to depart after a few days. On the day of
interview he stood at the proper place along with the high.
amirs. But this wild animal of the wilderness of ignorance,
who knew not the etiquette of the imperial court, went into
a corner and made improper expressions of dissatisfaction
and complaint to Kumar Ram Singh. His brainless head
led him to make a tumult. The Emperor ordered that he
should return to his lodging, that Kumar Ram Singh
should make him alight in a house near his own pavillion
and bring his son Sambha with himself to the audience, and
that Fulad Khan should watch him in view of the fraud and
satanic trickery of this arch-deceiver.

A royal letter containing all these matters was sent to
Raja Jai Singh [56] asking him to write what he considered


--- Page 48 ---
1666] . SHIVAJI FLEES FROM AGRA 37

politic, so that Shiva might be treated accordingly. After
two or three days, this knave in terror of the Emperor’s
wrath, turned to contriving some temedy ; and beseeching
the intercession of the nobles, he professed submission and
repentance. About this time the despatch of Jai Singh was
received, saying ‘‘I have given him promise and assurance
of safety and he is engaged in our warfare in this region.
Pardoning his offences would be advisable’. Therefore
Fulad Khan was ordered to remove the guards from his
house. Kumar Ram Singh, too, slackened his watch. This
artful cheat feigning sickness fled with his son on Sunday,
the 19th August/27th Safar. Thereupon, Kumar Ram
Singh was dismissed from his mansab. An order was sent
to Raja Jai Singh saying that the trouble-maker Netaji,
who was related to Shiva and had been created a 5-hazari
(same tr.) at the Raja’s request and was staying with him,
should be arrested by cunning and sent to the Court.

As the Emperor had decided on going to Delhi, for
transacting certain affairs, he sent in advance the Begam
Sahib and other ladies of the harem.

At this time a despatch of Tarbiyat Khan, who had
been sent on an embassy to Persia was received, stating the
wickedness of heart, folly, violence of temper, and unimagin-
able haughtiness of the wretched Shah ’Abbis, and reporting
that he wished to go to Khurasén with a view to waging
war. After Tarbiyat Khan’s arrival at the Court, this
matter was again communicated to the Emperor by him and
other reporters. The Emperor determined to punish this
empty-headed king, who wished to destroy the alliance
between them without any reason. [57] Accordingly he
first deputed Prince Muhammad Mu‘azzam with Maharaja
Jaswant Singh and declared that he himself would march
to the Panjab. As Tarbiyat Khan had committed some
faults in conducting the embassy, he was forbidden the
Court. On Tuesday, the 9th October/19th Rabi. S., the
Emperor set out by the Jamuna from Agra to Delhi, which
was reached in 14 stages.

On Saturday, the 27th October /8th Jamad. A., he was
weighed on his 49th solar birthday. Amir Khan, nazim
of Kabul had arrested and sent some Mughals to the Court
on the suspicion of their being spies. The Emperor
appointed ‘Itimad Khan and Mulla ‘Abdul Qawi to investi-
gate their case. The Khan took one of them without chains
or handcuffs to his private room. Suddenly the man rushed


--- Page 49 ---
38 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI (ex. 9

out of the room, went to the servant who stood outside with
his weapons, snatched away his sword, and returning struck
the Khan and killed him. The people around cut the man
down. The Emperor was grieved to hear of the death of
such a faithful old servant, and gave robes and promotions
to his sons and other relatives. He visited the mansion of
J‘afar Khan the premier noble, who offered presents of
jewels and jewelled ware.

Khwaja Ishaq who had gone last year on an embassy
to Kashghar, returned (from the way) on hearing of dis-
turbances in that country. But now on hearing of the settle-
ment of peace in that country he was sent a second time. [58 |

As the King of Persia was going from Farrukhabad to
Isfahan he was attacked with an inflammation of the throat
owing to exposure and died at Kharsammian on Wednesday,
the 22nd August/1st Rabi. A. His minister placed his
eldest son Mirza Safi on the throne. On Wednesday, the
12th December /24th Jamad. S., Aurangzib learnt this news
at his private hunting-lodge (khds shikdr) from the letters
of reporters on the frontiers, and said ‘‘My wish was
different (from this). But as the True Avenger has punished
him for his sins, it would not be generous and heroic to send
an army against the country of Iran’’. So an order was sent
to Prince Muhammad Mu‘azzam not to advance beyond
Iahore, but stay there for a few days.

Bahadur Khan, an officer sent with the Prince, returned
from the way to the Court, and was sent to Allahabad as
Subahdar. Raja Jai Singh, after arresting Shiva’s relation
Netaji sent him to the Court. He was made over to Fidai
Khan and accepted Islam.

As Raja Jai Singh after concluding the expedition
against Shiva, had gone with the imperial army to punish
‘Adil Khan, Abul Muhammad, grandson of Bahlol, one of
the ‘Adil Shahi chiefs joined the Raja, after two stages had
been passed. The new-comer was created a 5-hazari (same
number of troopers) at the Raja’s request and appointed to
assist in the war. At the Raja’s command and through
the exertions and services of Shiva and his general Netaji
[59] the forts Phaltan, Thathwara, Khawan, and Mangal-
beda were captured. During this period many heroic attacks
and fights took place with Abul Muhammad, Khawas Khan
and their countless army. The imperial army triumphed ;
all the villages adjacent to Bijapur were repeatedly overrun
and harried by our troops. In short, the imperial army


--- Page 50 ---

arrived within five kos of Bijapur. ‘Adil Khan after
strengthening the fort of Bijapur, cut the banks of his tanks,
filled up the surrounding wells with briars, razed to the
ground the homesteads outside the fort, stood a siege, and
appointed his army to repel the imperial forces. As the
Raja did not design to conquer the fort of Bijapur and had
not brought with himself siege-materials, he halted for some
days, and then marched away. On Saturday, the 20th
January, 1666/24th Rajab, he crossed the river Bhima.
Dianat Rai, the trusted servant of ‘Adil Khan, brought a
message to the Raja begging pardon and professing submis-
sion, with some jewelled ware. As the rainy season arrived,
and the Raja got a letter from the Emperor ordering him
to pass the monsoon at Aurangabad, he gave up the campaign
and returned.

At this time Dilir Khan by imperial command first
went to the kingdom of Chanda: Manji Mallar, the zamin-
dar, intetrviewed the Khan, gave him five lakhs of rupees,
and agreed to pay one kror of rupees as fine to the imperial
Government, and two lakhs of rupees as his permanent
annual tribute. Then the Khan went to the kingdom of
Deogarh. Kok (Kukia) Singh, the ruler of the place agreed
to pay 15 lakhs of rupees as the balance (of tribute) for the
past with an additional three lakhs [60] of rupees every
vear. After having gained composure about the affairs of
these places, the Khan again marched with his army by
command to the Deccan, and was created a 5-hazari (same
tr. do aspa seh-aspa).

CHAPTER X
TENTH YEAR OF THE REIGN, 1077 A. H.
15th February 1667—3rd February, 1668

The month of Ramzan led to the increase of charity and
good deeds. The Court officers made preparations for the
celebration.

On Sunday, the 24th February/10th Ramzan a prince
was delivered by Udipuri Mahal, and he was named
Muhammad Kambakhsh. Prince Muhammad Mu‘azzam,
on return from Lahore, had audience. On Sunday, the
17th March/1st Shawwal, the Emperor, after returning
from the place of prayer, sat on the throne, and conferred
favours on the princes and nobles.

Shiva’s relation Netaé, who had accepted Islam, was
raised after circumcision to the rank of a 3-hazari (2,0U0 tr.)
with the title of Muhammad Quli Khan. Mir ‘Imaduddin,
diwan of the bayutat, got the title of Rahmat Khan, and
‘Azizuddin that of Bahramand Khan. On Saturday, the 28rd
March/7th Shawwal, Prince Muhammad Mu‘azzam was
given conge as Subahdar of the Deccan; by an increment of
d-hazar, [61] he was created a W-hazari (12-hazar tr.).
Maharaja Jaswant Singh, Rai Singh, Saf Shikan Khan and
Sarbuland Khan were appointed under him, and given
favours. Raja Jai Singh was recalled to Court.

DISTURBANCES CAUSED BY THE YUSUFZAI AFGHANS

When the Emperor learnt of the rising of the Yusufzai
Afghans,.their exalting as their commander a silly beggar
under the name of Muhammad Shah, the disturbances
caused by the exertions of that deceitful impostor the wicked
Mulla Chalak, and the leadership of the bldck-faced Bhagu,
he sent orders to Kamil Khan, faujdar of Attock, to gather
together the faujdars and jagirdars of the environs of the
river Nilab, and engage in crushing the rebels as far as
possible.

Order was sent to Amir Khan, Subahdar of Kabul, to
depute Shamshir Khan, with five thousand men to put them
down. Kamil Khan in his eagerness, did not wait for the


--- Page 52 ---
1667 ] YUSUFZAI RISING 41

arrival of Shamshir Khan, but fought a severe engagement
with the enemy, overpowered them, and recovered the
imperial outposts. On Thursday, the 2nd May /18th Zil. Q.
Shamshir Khan after crossing the river Nilab, came towards
Attock, and entered the enemy’s territory on the other side
of the river opposite the Yusufzai country. The enemy
went away to the hills and waited for an opportunity.

_ On that day, Muhammad Amin Khan Mir Bakhshi,
with Amir Khan, Qubad Khan and other commanders, and
9,000 troopers in all, was sent from the Court to punish
these ,rebels. Before the arrival of this Khan, Shamshir
Khan had repeatedly fought great battles and engagements.
[62]. Three hundred of the leading maliks of the tribes
were taken prisoner. On hearing of it the Emperor honoured
Shamshir Khan and Kamil Khan with imperial favours.

On Thursday, the 9th May, 1667/25th Zil. Q., the
Emperor was weighed on his 51st lunar birthday. During
this celebration Prince Muhammad ‘Azam was made a
15-hazari (7 hazar tr.) by an increment of 3-hazdr. Prince
Muhammad Akbar was made a 8-hazdri (2 hazar tr.) and
granted the tuman tugh, kettledrum, and umbrella.
‘Umdatul Mulk J‘afar Khan and the officers at Court and
the provinces were cherished with various favours. Rustam
Bey and Khushi Bey, the envoys of the Kings of Bukhara
and Balkh respectively, were presented with robes and cash
and given conge. From first to last two lakhs of rupees
were spent on the envoy of Bukhara, and one lakh and 50
thousand rupees on that of Balkh. Razavi Khan of Bukhara
was appointed Sadr vice ‘Abid Khan. Tarbiyat Khan’s
offences were pardoned, and he was sent to Orissa as
Subahdar vice Khan-i-Dauran deceased. It was learnt from
the letters of the reporters of Burhanpur that Raja Jai Singh
was coming from Aurangabad to the Court when on arriving
there he died on the 28th of Muharram.* The Emperor
cherished his son Kumar Ram Singh, who had so long been
under punishment, by giving him the title of Raja and many
favours.

Muhammad Amin Khan after arriving in the Afghan
country harried and desolated their homes as far as possible ;

* This date is incorrect. The writer’s sole authority, the Alamgirndmah
(p. 1051) merely states—‘‘On the 28th [month not given] from the gews-letters
of Burhanpur the Emperor learnt that Raja Jai Singh has died in that city,”
The dynastic list maintained by the Jaipur State gives 28th August 1667
(18th Rabi A) as the date of his death, and therefore the news of it may
have reached the Emperor on the 28th of Rabi-ul-awwal, and not possibly
on that day of the month of Muharram (=10 July), . :

the Emperor ordered him to leave Shamshir Khan there and
come to Lahore, [63] and be its Subahdar vice Ibrahim
Khan. .
On Monday, the 2nd December, 1667 /25th Jamad. S.,
the Emperor was weighed for his 50th solar birthday. From
the letters of the news-writers of the province of Kashmir
and the despatch of Murad Khan, zamindar of [Lesser]
Tibet, the Emperor learnt that ‘Abdullah Khan the ruler
of Kashghar, after being overpowered by his son Bulbars

Khan, had with his family and dependants and a few of his

servants in a plundered and destitute condition, turned his

face in this direction with a view to seeking refuge with the

Emperor. It was also learnt that Khwaja Ishaq, who had

been sent to him as envoy, had interviewed him in this con-

dition and helped him to be released from this difficulty, and

that they would soon reach Kashmir.

On hearing this news the Emperor in his extreme kind-
ness and appreciation of worth, deputed Khwaja Sadiq of
Badakhshan and Saifullah to act as guest-superintendent to
this noble King; one dagger, one jewelled jigha, one hundred
and nine Arab, Persian and Turki horses, some of which
had jewelled and gold trappings, two elephants, some gold
and silver vessels, a certain number of suits of dress, nice
robes, tents, pavilions, precious carpets, and all other articles
of splendour, were sent with them; and the above officers
were ordered to hasten to Kashmir, meet the noble Khan
there, and act as his caretakers till his arrival at the Court.
An order was sent to Mumtaz Khan, Subahdar of Kashmir,
directing that when ‘Abdullah Khan, [64] would reach that
pleasant land, he should be supplied by the imperial govern-
ment with all his necessaries, and given 50,000 rupees from
the provincial treasury, and that when he would start for
the Court, the Subahdar should accompany and conduct him
to His Majesty. .

An order was issued to Muhammad Amin Khan,
Subahdar of Lahore, that when ‘Abdullah Khan would come
within the limits of that province he should treat him with
every respect and care, properly perform the rites of hospi-
tality, and give him 50,000 rupees from the public revenue,
and a large amount and some articles on his own behalf.
Similarly, orders were issued to all the governors and
faujdars on his route to perform the rites of hospitality in
their respective places, and conduct him over their jurisdic-
tions in the most excellent manner,

1667] AHOMS RECOVER GAUHATI 48

- On Thursday, the 19th December/18th Rajab,
Danishmand Khan was made Mir Bakshi vice Muhammad
Amin Khan, and presented with a special robe and a jewelled
pen-case. At this time Khwaja Bahlol was appointed com-
mandant of Gwalior vice Muhammad Mu‘atamad Khan and
received a robe, a horse, a dagger, and the title of Khidmat-
gar Khan, while the title of Khidmatgar Khan was changed
to Khidmatguzar Khan. At this time it was learnt from
the news-reports of Bengal that the wretched Assamese had
a second time audaciously crossed their own frontier and
attacked Gauahati on the boundary of Bengal, with a vast
army and a large flotilla; and that as reinforcement had not
reached Sayyid Firuz Khan, the thanadar of the place, the
enemy had conquered Gauahati, and the aforesaid Khan had
bravely [65] sacrificed his life with many of his comrades
in devotion (to duty). The Emperor decided that one of the
great and eminent nobles of the Court should be deputed
to Bengal with an army from His Presence to put down the
enemy and that he should join this force to some of the troops
serving in Bengal, and engage in chastising this wicked
tribe. Therefore, Raja Ram Singh was appointed to perform
this exploit. On Friday, the 27th December, 1667 /21st
Rajab he was sent off with a robe, a horse with gold
trappings and a jewelled dagger with pearl strap. Nasiri
Khan, Kesari Singh Bhurtia [Rathor], Raghunath Singh
Mairtia, Brahmadeo Sisodia and many other nobles and
mansabdars, 1,500 dhadis, and 500 barqandazes were
appointed under him.

Here ends my abridgment of the history of the first
ten years.

CHAPTER XI

AUTHOR’S PREFACE
(Twenty-two lines of trite remarks omilted.]

[67] Be it known to the reader that the ‘Alamgirnamah,
giving the incidents of the first ten years of the reign of the
Emperor Abul Zafar Muhiuddin Muhammad Aurangzib
‘Alamgir Ghazi, was written by * * * [68] Mirza Muham-
mad Kazim. The Emperor forbade the writer to continue
the history thereafter, * * *

After the death of this Emperor, in the reign of Abul
Nasar Qutbuddin Shah ‘Alam Bahadur Padishah Ghazi,
‘Inayetullah Khan, chief of the wazir’s diwan and personal
disciple of ‘Alamgir, urged this worthless fool Muhammad
Must‘ad Khan that many of the occurrences and incidents,
sayings and acts of Aurangzib during the (last) forty vears
of his reign were hidden from our knowledge and that
‘Alamgir’s deeds had not been collected in a history. ‘‘You
have tasted the cup of meaning, and possess sufficient ability
to express the praise of Alamgir, and to discharge this
task.’”’

I pleaded, ‘‘This is [69] a difficult task, beyond the
capacity of man full of defects such as Iam. The execution
of such works depends upon the demand of leaders appre-
ciative of merit and right-minded masters expert in handling
words. In their absence, the work produced would be con-
signed to the niche of forgetfulness. If the sheets of the
news-letters of the Court and the provinces be collected,
then the work of the composition may be accomplished with
ease. A passionate friend has no other thought than to
realise his desire by any means whatsoever, and (thus) to
leave a memorial for all times.’’ [But] my entreaty pro-
duced no-effect (on his mind).

This humble servant, who considered it his duty to be
true to the salt of the virtuous Emperor, and had been all
his life one of the knot of servants standing outside the door’
of His Majesty’s Court, recorded what he had seen, and
what he had learnt on inquiry from the trusty friends who
had borne office during that reign. As this book of fortunate
victories contains the triumphs of the Emperor ‘Alamgir,

I considered ‘‘Maasir-i-‘Alamgiri’’ as its proper title, that
phrase being its title as well as giving its date (year of
completion), 1120 A. H./1708 A. D. [70]

111TH YEAR OF THE REIGN: 1078 A. 8.

4th February, 1668—22nd January; 1669

With the month of Ramzan, the 11th year began. The
courtiers set about making preparations for the (annual
coronation) festivity. The month of Ramzan was spent in
fasting during the day and remaining quiet at night. -On
Thursday, the 5th March/1st Shawwal, the Emperor went
to the mosque to perform the two-fold prayers of ‘Id-ul-fitr,
and on his return sat on the throne in the Public Audience
Hall. The Princes and peers made their salutations and
were granted promotions, robes of honour, and titles.

Coronation Gazette : Muhammad ‘Azam got a robe and
a jewelled dhup, and Muhammad Kambakhsh a robe.
Umdat-ul-mulk J‘afar Khan was given a robe and a silver-
hilted dagger, Danishmand Khan, Mir Bakhshi, a robe, an
elephant, and promotion to the rank of a 5-hazari (2,000 tr.),
The imperial physician, gained promotion to the rank of
2,500 zat, (100 tr.), [71] Himmat Khan to the rank of
24% hazari (1,200 tr.), and Lutfullah Khan to that of 1%
hazari (500 tr.), Muhammad Ism‘ail, son of Asad Khan,
got his appointment to the rank of 3-sadi. Muhammad
Y‘aqub, son of Shaikh Mir, formerly a 4-sadi (100 tr.) now
got an increment of 200 troopers. Ibrahim Khan was
appointed Subahdar of Bihar, vice Lashkar Khan and raised
to the rank of a 5-hazari (5,000 tr.) Mahabat Khan, Subah-
dar of Ahmadabad Gujrat, had audience, and was created
Subahdar of Kabul vice Sayyid Amir Khan.

As the Emperor had no liking for pleasure, and Iris
devotion to duty left him no time for festivity, he ordered
that the chief musician Khush-hal Khan, Bisram Khan,
Ras-bin, and others might come to the Court, but must not
make music. Gradually (music) was entirely forbidden.

On Thursday, the 12th March /8th Shawwal, ‘Abdullah
Khan (the expelled King of Kashghar), who had come to the
environs of Delhi, alighted in one of the gardens. The
Emperor ordered arrangements to be made for his hospitable
reception. On Sunday, the 15th March/11th Shawwal,
Umdat-ul-mulk J‘afar Khan and Asad Khan went outside

the city to bring him to His Majesty. While riding he

On Saturday, the 1st January, 1670/18th Shaban the
Emperor took up his residence in the palace of Agra fort.

Gokla Jat, the accursed rebel and the ring-leader of
the disturbance in the country of Tilpat, who was the cause
of the killing of ‘Abdun Nabi Khan and had plundered the
pargana of S‘adabad, [94] was captured through the valour
and efforts of Hasan ‘Ali Khan and his peshkar Shaikh
Raziuddin. The Khan sent him and his comrade Sonki
to the Emperor in charge of Shaikh Qawm. By imperial
order, his limbs were hacked off one after another in the
chabutra of the kotwali. His son and daughter were made
over to Jawahir Khan, nazir, for being brought up (as
Muslims). The daughter was married to Shah Quli
Chelah (slave), an intimate servant of high rank. The son
became a memoriser of the Quran with the name of Fazil,
and in the opinion of the Emperor surpassed in correctness
all other memorisers, and he had the happiness of hearing
His Majesty’s chanting of the Quran.

Shaikh Raziuddin, a very learned and high-born man
of Bhagalpur in Bihar, was among the scholars engaged in
compiling the Fatawa-i-‘Alamgiri, and got a daily stipend
of three rupees. He had many other accomplishments such
as military skill, administrative capacity, pleasantness of
speech, and knowledge about most places, His merits were

CHAPTER XIII
THIRTEENTH YEAR OF THE REIGN. (1080 A.H.)

18th January, 1670—I1st January, 1671.

On Thursday, 27th January /15th Ramzan, the justice-
loving Emperor ordered that complainants should not be
excluded from the side of the window of darsan : the harem-
officers were to draw up their petitions by means of ropes
and show them to His Majesty. During this month of
Ramzan abounding in miracles, the Emperor as the
promoter of justice and overthrower of mischief, as a knower
of truth and destroyer of oppression, as the zephyr of the
garden of victory and the reviver of the faith of the Prophet,
issued orders for the demolition of the temple situated in
Mathura, famous as the Dehra of Kesho Rai. In a short
time by the great exertions of his officers, the destruction
of this strong foundation of infidelity was accomplished, and
on its site a lofty mosque was built at the expenditure of
a large sum. This temple of folly was built by that gross
idiot Birsingh Deo Bundela. Before his accession to the
throne, the Emperor Jahangir was displeased with Shaikh
Abul Fazl. [96] This infidel became a royal favourite by
slaying him, and after Jahangir’s accession was rewarded
for this service with the permission to build the temple,
which he did at an expense of thirty-three lakhs of rupees.

Praised be the august God of the faith of Islam, that
in the auspicious reign of this destroyer of infidelity and
turbulence, such a wonderful and seemingly impossible
work was successfully accomplished. On seeing this
instance of the strength of the Emperor’s faith and the
grandeur of his devotion to God, the proud Rajas were
stifled, and in amazement they stood like images facing the
wall. The idols, large and small, set with costly jewels,
which had been set up in the temple, were brought to Agra,
and buried under the steps of the mosque of the Begam
Sahib, in order to be continually trodden upon. The name of
Mathura was changed to Islamabad.

On 12th February, 1670, the day of ‘Id, the Emperor
rode out on a huge elephant, with Prince Muhammad
‘Azam seated behind him, and dismounted at the ‘Idgah.

was granted kettle-drums. Ashraf Khan and Himmat Khan
were promoted by 500 troopers; Mir Taqi was made a

Khan were presented with two riding horses of great speed.

jewelled sword worth 5,000 rupees, an elephant with a silver
saddle, a flowered shawl, 150 pieces of cannon, Aghabani
turban, and Gujrati fota of the same value; his followers
received 10,000 rupees as reward. Muhammad ‘Abid, son
of Zahid Khan Panjabi got the rank of 14-hazari (800 tr.)
[98] and the title of Nawazish Khan. Darab Khan,
darogha of the Emperor’s own musket-room, became
darogha of the ghusalkhana vice ‘Abdyllah Khan. The
bayutat of Agra thus reported the price of grain to the
Emperor: fine Sukhdas rice at 14 seers, wheat 35 seers,.
pulse 1 md. 2 seers, ghee (raughan) 4 seers, for a rupee and
the prices of other articles were also according to this
standard.

On Sunday, the 27th March 1670/15th Zil. Q., the
54th lunar year of the Emperor’s life began. Festive
decorations were suspended. ‘The officers of the band-room

The courtiers who used to salute each other by raising
the hand to the head, were now ordered to say [simply |
salam ‘alekum,

On Wednesday, 20th April/9th Zil. H., Mulla ‘Abdul
‘Aziz ‘Izzat, son of Mulla ‘Abdul Rashid Akbarabadi, had
[99] audience in the mosque through the mediation of
Himmat Khan and Bakhtawar [cor. ] Khan. He, after acquir-
ing knowledge of both the traditional and rational branches of
learning alike and attaining to the high rank of a master
of all the sciences, was spending his days in a life of
seclusion in his house contented with a daily stipend of three
rupees only, and never bowed his head down in supplication
to any of the powerful grandees. As fortune had destined
him for celebrity and advancement, his great intellectual
powers, wisdom, mastery of meaning, elegance of language,
sound understanding and agreeable nature, judicious speech
and power of devising plans became the cause of his being
taken up for training and favour at the Court of the
Emperor, who discovers and discerns all merit. The Shaikh
at first got a mansab of 400, a robe, 5 horses, a sword, a
dagger, a spear, a decorated palki and other articles. On
the fourth day, when the grants were reported a second time
for confirmation, he got an increment of 100 (80 tr.) and the
post of darogha-i-‘arz-i-mukarrar, vice Wutfullah Khan.
He was elevated by being given the right of private
audience, and that of not having to raise his hand to
his head before anybody,—‘salam ‘alek’ being enough for
him.

News came from the Deccan that Shivaji after seizing
the fort of Purandar had captured the qiladar, Raziuddin.
Bakhtawar Khan issued orders to the diwani officers that
they should report to the Emperor the income and expen-
diture at the end of the year and should bring to the ghusal-
khana, (every) Wednesday the registers of the Diwans of
the tankhwa and the Crown-land departments. ‘Inayet Khan
reported that since the reign of Shah Jahan the public ex-
penditure had exceeded the income by 14 lakhs of rupees. It
was ordered that the privy purse (khalsa) income should
be fixed at four krores of rupees, and the expenditure the
same. After looking over the accounts of disbursements,
His Majesty retrenched many items of the expenditure of
the Emperor, the Princes, and the begams.

It was reported that Hasan ‘Ali Khan was sparing no
exertion in slaying and capturing the infidel rebels, plun-

ing their strong forts, and had planted Shah Muhammad
Nawaz, Sidam Baluch, Shaikh Raziuddin, L‘al Muhammad,

of the zamindani; he was ordered to come to Court. On
Wednesday, the 6th April/25th Zil. Q., he had audience
and was highly praised. On Saturday, the 9th April, 1670/
28th Zil. Q., news came from Delhi of the death of
Badrunnisa Begam, daughter of the Emperor. The father
greatly loved her for her Rabi‘a-like piety, memorisation
of the Quran, good character and manners.

News came that Prince Muhammad Mu‘azzam had
been instigated by flatterers to act in a self-willed and
independent manner. [101] The Emperor’s letters of
advice producing no effect, he summoned the Prince’s
mother, Nawab Bai from Delhi, in order to send her to her
son for bringing him back to the right path if any trace of
recalcitrancy was found in him. Iftikhar Khan was sent
to the Prince, with a verbal message of mingled kindness
and reproach. The Khan speedily went to his destination
and discharged his mission. As the Prince’s character was
full of devotion to the Emperor and the reports against
him were utterly false, he replied very submissively,
expressing grief and regret. His Majesty, therefore,
renewed his favour to the Prince, and became very angry
with Iftikhar Khan for his error of judgment. When the
Khan returned he and his brother Multafat Khan [102]
were deprived of their ranks and titles. Sher Beg, mace-
bearer, conducted Sultan Husain across the river of Attock
and brought Mir Ibrahim Husain to Lahore, under his
strict escort (saza@wali). Ashraf Khan was made Khan-i-
saman vice Iftikhar Khan and Mughal Khan was made
darogha of the macebearers vice Ashraf Khan. Haji Ahmad

came that (Dilir Khan after reinstating the zamindar of
Deogarh in his zamindari had returned to Aurangabad.
Nawab Bai, summoned from Delhi, reached Sikandara on
Thursday, the 18th April/2nd Zil.Q. Prince Muhammad
Akbar, Bakhshiulmulk Asad Khan and Bahramand Khan
advanced to meet her, and conducted her to the imperial
harem. ,

imprisoned there. [103] Sarbuland Khan was to conduct
her to Prince Muhammad Mu‘azzam in the Deccan, and

As the illness of ‘Umdatulmulk J‘afar Khan became
severer, the Emperor twice went to his house, at first to
comfort the sick man and the second time to condole with
his relatives. On Friday the 6th May, 1670/25th Zil. H.,
he died. In his character were united all graciousness of
heart and grandeur of behaviour. The Emperor mourned
the death of such a devoted servant, and ordered that for 3
days 120 dishes of food should be sent to. the bereaved
family. Princes Muhammad ‘Azam and Akbar were ordered
to go to the houses of his sons, Namdar Khan and Kamgar

Bahram, and his sons Bahramand Khan and Sharfuddin,

The astonishing octurrence of the suppression of the
Satnamis who are (also) called Mundiyas.

Those who observe the wondrous works of Heaven have
been filled with astonishment at the occurrence of this affair
in which a rebellious horde of low people like goldsmiths,
carpenters, scavengers, tanners [115] and members of
other menial professions, who are naturally weak and fore-
doomed to slaughter, took I know not what into their heads
so that they were filled with a spirit of obstinate self-will,
as if in their rebellious pride they felt their heads to be
an untolerable burden on their shoulders and wilfully
walked into the trap of their destruction. The detailed
account of this affair is as follows :

A large body of wicked mischief-makers of the Miwat
district suddenly sprang out of the ground like termites
(winged ants) and descended from the sky like locusts. It
was said that these wicked people considered themselves
immortal, and believed that if one of them was slain,
seventy others would spring up in his place. They defied
the imperial authority and caused disturbances near Narnol,

were ordered to set out against these infidels. When the
imperial troops reached the place, the enemy resolving to
fight advanced inspite of their lack of war materials; [116]
they acted the battle described in old Hindu books called
in the Hindu tongue the Mahabharat, which means the
slaying of elephants in the field. The Muslim heroes
charged and reddened their pitiless swords in the blood of
the rebels. A terrible battle was fought. R‘adandaz Khan,
Hamid Khan and Yahiya Khan greatly distinguished them-
selves. Many of the Muslims were slain, and many others
wounded. At last the enemy took to flight, and many of
them were slain by the victors in the pursuit, very few
escaped ; our generals won the victory and the tract was
cleared of the infidels. The victors were granted audience
and congratulated by the Emperor. R‘adandaz Khan was

On Friday, the 29th March/10th Zil. H., occurred the
‘Id-uz-zuha. [117] Disaster to Muhammad Amin Khan,
and retreat from the Khyber Pass: * * *

Muhammad Amin Khan wanted to go to govern Kabul
and encounter the turbulent Afghans. On Sunday the 21st
April, 1672/83rd Muharram, though he had got the news
that the Afghans had blocked the pass of Khyber before the
day on which he had planned to cross it, he proceeded on
without paying any heed to it or considering it necessary
to dislodge them. At the time of crossing the same disorder
took place among his troops which had happened in Akbar’s
time to Hakim Abul Fath, Zain Khan Kokah and Raja
Birbal. The Afghans crowded on all sides, and began to hurl
arrows and stones. The troops were scattered and [118] the
horses, elephants, and men were mixed up in confusion.
At this crisis, although several thousand men had lost
their lives by falling from the summit of the hills into the
abyss, Muhammad Amin Khan from his high sense of
honour wanted to sacrifice his life in fight. But his servants
seized his bridle and brought him away from the place of
danger. After losing ‘Abdullah Khan, the young and
faithful son of the Khan, and without gaining any honour,
he galloped back to Peshawar in a wretched condition. The
Emperor got this news on the 30th April /12th Muharram.

On Saturday, the 18th May/30th Muharram, Fidai
Khan left Lahore for Peshawar. On 8th May, 1672/20th

removal from the faujdari of Attock, and the sister instigated
her son saying, “‘If you do not kill this shameless wretch in
the Court, I shall not give you a quittance for my milk’’.
Then flinging her veil at his head, she cried out, ‘‘Wear
it and stay within doors’’. The son obeying his mother’s
command reached the place where Farjam was standing
during the bustle and noise caused by the Emperor’s taking
his seat in the Hall of Audience, slew him with one stab
and then tried to run away. But he was captured and
thrown into prison. On Thursday, the 13th March/4th

Friday, the 26th June/2nd Rabi. S., the Emperor reached
[the palace at] Hasan Abdal.

A charming anecdote is told of the virtue and kindness
of His Majesty, the vice-gerent of God the Giver. Two or
three days after his arrival at the above place he visited the
garden of Hasan Abdal. The author’s servants complained
that under the wall of the palace an old man used to work
a water-mill, which was turned by the water that issued
from the garden and fell inte.a nalé, As the place was in


--- Page 94 ---
1674] EMPEROR’S CHARITY TO OLD MAN 83

charge of the palace ndazir’s officers, they had closed the
path of water. As a consequence the people had difficulty
in grinding flour, and the old man too found it hard to
secure his livelihood. [184] I reported the whole matter
to Bakhtawar Khan, and he in his turn to the Emperor, who
ordered him to go and personally open the water-course, and
issued strict orders so that none should hinder the old man’s
work. In accordance with the Emperor’s order it was done.
At night, when the Khan returned to his quarters after
14 prahars, His Majesty who was then seated at his table.
entrusted two dishes of food and five ashrafis.to Shaikh
Abul Khair, son of the great scholar and courtier Shaikh
Nizam, saying, ‘‘Carry these to Bakhtawar Khan, he will
guide you to the house of the old man, as he may possibly
know it. Convey my salain to the poor man and beg his
pardon saying (on my behalf), You are my neighbour, and
my arrival has caused you hardship. Pardon me.’’ The
Shaikh came to the Khan, and after inquiries and exertions
learnt from a footman that there was a village on another
hillock, where the old man had his hut. The footman
guided the Shaikh to the place at midnight, awakened the
old man, tendered the apology, and secured the absolution.

Next day Darbar Khan the nazir was ordered to send
the Emperor’s palki to him and bring him to the mahal.
The old man, who had never before in his life heard the
name of palki, not to speak of his seeing a palki with
poles of silver, was brought in. The Emperor inquired
into his ‘circumstances. He replied that he had two
unmarried daughters and two sons with bare heads and
feet, and that his wife was living. Two hundred
rupees were presented to him. He passed two nights in the
mahal, and received money, ornaments, and dresses from
all [1385]. As he had heard from some one that I had
pressed his suit on Bakhtawar Khan, he came and stood
before my tent, with a do-shala on his back, a gown
(peshwaz) with a daman (hem) on his body, a scarf with gold
thread (déman-badla) on his head, kinkhab drawers on his
legs, his lap full of gold coins, rupees, and gold ornaments,
and a face full of a hundred wrinkles and bleared eyes. I
asked ‘‘Who art thou ?’’ He replied ‘‘I am the man, who
has come to such a good fortune through the help of you
and your Khan.’’ ‘‘Be you blessed!’’ I rejoined, and took
him to the Khan, who also made him some presents. After
two or three days, the Emperor again ordered the nazir to


--- Page 95 ---
934 MAASIR-I-ALAMGIRI (cu. 17

: \

bring him with his daughters. The eunuchs took the palkis
and fetched them. This time he got 1,000 rupees for dowry
(kanyadan). The people of the mahal gave him money,
ornaments and dresses, double those of the first occasion.
He was granted water for a second mill in the neighbour-
hood. Order was issued to the nazir to give him sanads
from the imperial daftar exempting him from the payment
of taxes and molestation for any of the prohibited cesses
(abwab).

Hakim Sanjak went by command to the old man’s
house to treat his eye. Afterwards the man was taken to the
houses of Princes Muhammad Sultan, Muhammad ‘Azam,
Muhammad Mu‘azzam, Muhammad Akbar, Asad Khan
and Yalangtosh Khan and favoured by them. His daughters
were married. His sons put on cloaks of gold embroidery.
His wife, having passed through the beauty and vigour of
youth, was known as the old crone and leader of the
villagers. But it was seen as a fact that this old woman
Zulekha-like grew youthful again through the grace of the
Yusuf of the Age. It is no exaggeration to say that the
wrinkles [136] on her face disappeared and gave place to
loveliness. Her bleared eyes sparkled again. * * *

Aghar Khan was sent with Nusrat Khan, Mirza Sultan
and a force with the necessary equipments to chastise the

. Afghans of Jamrud and Khyber. Rai La‘l Chand was sent
to investigate the affairs of the Crownlands of the Subah of
Kabul. The Emperor decided that Prince Akbar and Asad

but owing to his extravagance he had difficulty in securing
his livelihood, even though he was granted some jagirs and
cash rewards. He began to show laxity in discharging his
work and attending at the Court, and as if it were the will
of God that he would not come out of this plight, he applied
to be permitted to go to Lahore for some time. The Emperor
assented after repeating the verse :

‘‘Don’t have your hand tied to your neck, nor open
it entirely.”’
(Be neither niggardly nor extravagant.)

It was ordered that [utfullah Khan as his deputy
should present the officers to the Emperor and Bakhtawar

and [147] cried out in a terrible voice, ‘‘Why are you
coming? Get out’’.

‘‘T had hoped to give up my life in the service of my master.
But it is not to be, hence my grief. Others present gold
and gems to His Majesty, I wanted to present a few lives
(of the enemy) in exchange of mine. That might probably
be of use to His Majesty.’’ After the Sayyid’s death many

of the Yunani doctors that he desired to treat him. When
I went, I found him reclining in bed and engaged in com-
position ; his words were being written down by his pupils,
such as Mir Hadi, Muhammad S‘aid ‘Ajaz, and dthers. On
hearing the imperial message he replied to the author, ‘‘T
have no prejudice for any particular system of treatment.

(i.e., the Yunani doctors of the Court). If any of them be

fit for being given a call, I have no objection. I have chosen
as my doctor ‘Abdul Malik, on whose book-learning,
diagnosis, experience, and prudence I have reliance. Life
is not so precious an article that for prolonging it [cor. |
we should make such frantic exertions. We must be
drowned in water, when it rises above the head.’’ I reported
this speech to Bakhtawar Khan, who asked me to write it
down, and then read it to His Majesty. The Emperor [165]
said to the Khan, ‘‘You will not believe that the greatest of

and in agreement with the canonical traditions, jazia should
be collected from the infidels (zimmis) of the capital and the
provinces. Many of the honest scholars of the time were
appointed to discharge the work (of collecting jazia). May
God actuate him to do that which He loves and is pleased
with, and make his future life better than the present!

[175] On Sunday, the 18th April, 12th Rabi. A.,
Prince Muhammad Akbar was sent to Lahore, and presented
with a special robe of half-sleeves, a quiver, a bow-case, two
horses with gold saz, a jewelled sarpech, and a muttaka.
Muhammad Zaman Tuhani was made a Khan, and Shah
Beg Khan Kashghari got the title of ‘Abdullah Khan.
Iftikhar Khan and others, after being rewarded, accom-
panied the Prince. On Saturday, the 19th April/18th
Rabi. A., Kumar Jai Singh, son of the Rana, was sent back
to his home with a robe, a pearl sarpech, a ruby pendent, a
jewelled turban-end, an Arab horse with gold trappings and
an elephant. To the Rana Raj Singh were sent a farman,
a robe, a jewelled sarpech and 20,000 rupees.

On Sunday, the 25th May /24th Rabi. S., Khan Jahan
Bahadur came from Jodhpur, after demolishing the temples
and bringing with himself some cart-loads of idols, and had
audience of the Emperor, who highly praised him and
ordered that the idols, which were mostly jewelled, golden,
silvery, bronze, copper or stone, should be cast in the yard
(jilaukhanah) of the Court and under the steps of the Jam‘a

mosque, to be trodden on. They remained so for some time
and at last their very names were lost. On Monday, the
26th May/25th Rabi. S., Indra Singh, son of Rao Rai
Singh, grandson of Amar Singh, was appointed Raja of
Jodhpur in succession to his uncle Jaswant Singh, and given
the title of Raja, a special robe, a sword, [176] with jewelled
saz, a horse with gold saz, an elephant, banner, tugh, and
kettledrums. He presented a tribute of thirty-six lakhs of
rupees which was graciously accepted. It was formerly the
practice of the Emperors to apply the tika with their own
hands to the foreheads of the great Rajas, and in this reign
Asad Khan had by command put the tikd on the forehead of
Raja Ram Singh. The practice was now forbidden, salutation
(taslim) alone being declared to be enough.

‘Aqil Khan became Bakhshi-i-tan vice Safi Khan. On
Tuesday, the 24th June /25th Jamad. A., Darab Khan of the
Bani Mukhtar (Sayvid clan) died. Mourning robes were
presented to Jan-sipar Khan, his brother, to Muhammad
Khalil, Muhammad Taqi and Muhammad Kamyab, his
sons, and to his son-in-law Lashkari. Ruhullah Khan
succeeded him as mir atish; and Bahramand Khan became
akhta begi vice Ruhullah, ‘Itiqad Khan bakhshi of the
adhadis vice Bahramand. News came from the army of
Prince Muhammad Mu‘azzam that Sharza Khan Bijapuri
had interviewed him, the Emperor created him Rustam
Khan, and sent him a letter, a robe, a horge, an elephant,
a banner, and kettledrums.

As Raja Jaswant Singh had left no son when he died
in (the province of) Kabul, his trusted servants, viz. [177]
Sonang, Raghunathdas Bhatti, Ranchhor, Durgadas and
others, reported to the Emperor after the Raja’s death that
two of his wives who were pregnant had, after their arrival
at Lahore, delivered each a son. These servants after
reporting the fact of the birth of the sons, begged that
mansab and the kingdom might be conferred (on one of
them). The Emperor ordered that the sons should be sent
to his Court, and that when they would come of age, mansab
and raj would ‘be granted. These shallow-brained people
after reaching Delhi pressed their request with great
insistence. At this time one of the two sons died. When
the Emperor learnt that these wicked men mischievously
wished to flee, carry the second son with the two mothers to
Jodhpur, and raise a tumult there, he on Tuesday, the 15th
July, 1679/16th Jamad. S., ordered both the Ranis and the

child, who were living in the mansion of Rup Singh
Rathor, to be seized and placed in Nurgarh. Fulad Khan
Kotwal, Sayvid Hamid Khan with the men of the khas
chauki, Hamid Khan, son of Daud Khan, Kamaluddin Khan
son of Dilir Khan, and Khwaja Mir (who had got the title of
Salabat Khan) with the servants of the cavalry (risala) of
the late Prince Sultan Muhammad, were ordered to make
these wicked men abstain from their criminal plan, [178]
and to prevent them from carrying out their crude design,
and if they foolishly engaged in fight, to give them proper
chastisement. The. officers appointed tried counsel and
friendly dissuasion; but the wretched infidels rashly took to
fighting, and after slaying many of the imperialists, large
numbers of the defenders perished. When the Rajputs found
themselves hard pressed by the imperialists, they slew the
two Ranis, who had been brought into the field in male
attire, left the second son, who had been concealed in the
house of a milk-vendor there, and then broke and fled.
Fulad Khan who had learnt the fact about the second son,
took him from the milk-vendor’s house to the Court. By order
he was shown to the Raja’s servant-girls who had been made
prisoners, and they acknowledged him to be the Raja’s son.
He was kept in the harem in charge of the servants of
Zeb-un-nisa Begam, and named Muhammadi Raj. The
Khan next day secured the ornaments’ and other things of
the child. In the tumult the property of the Raja, the two
Ranis, and the other Rajputs was taken away by plunderers.
What [179] the imperial clerks seized for the State was
ordered to be delivered into the treasury (kotha) of the
bait-ul-mal. ‘The corpses of both the Ranis and of Ranchhor
the Rajput chief, and the heads of thirty of their captains
were counted. The rest, who had escaped from the imperial
officers, reached Jodhpur on Wednesday, 28rd July /24th
Jamad.S. They under the instigation of Durgadas and
others imputed to Raja Jaswant Singh two counterfeit boys,
one Ran-thamb (who died) and the other Ajit Singh, and
caused disturbances. Tahir Khan, faujdar of Jodhpur, who
had not shown any vigour in obstructing the fugitives, was
dismissed and deprived of his title of Khan. Indra Singh,
who was too incompetent to rule the country and put down
the disturbances, was summoned to Court.

On Sunday, the 17th August /20th Rajab, the Emperor
visited the garden of Khizirabad. A strong force was sent
under Sarbuland Khan to wrest Jodhpur from the Rajputs.

1679 | INVASION OF JODHPUR COUNTRY 111

On Saturday, the 28rd August/26th Rajab, the
Emperor learnt that Raj Singh (Rathor), one of the officers
of the Raja, having gathered together a countless host, had
encountered Tahawwar Khan faujdar of Ajmir ; 1 severe fight
was waged for three days; after the discharge of arrows and
bullets, fighting at close quarters took place ; mounds of the
slain were formed on both sides; at last Tahawwar Khan
gained the victory [180] and Raj Singh with numberless
men went to hell. Indeed, so great was the valour exhibited
(by the imperialists) that the Rajputs never again came
forward to fight, but hid their heads in deserts and
wildernesses.

On Friday, the 29th August, 1679/2nd Sha‘ban,
Muhammad Akbar from Lahore had, audience; a robe and
special jewels worth 77,000 rupees, were conveyed to his
house by Khwaja Himmat.

THE EMPEROR’S SECOND JOURNEY FROM DELHI TO AJMIR

On Wednesday, the 3rd September/7th Shaban, the
imperial camp started for punishing the rebels. That day
Muhammad Akbar was sent from the stage of the village of
Palam, to go in advance to Ajmir, and was presented with a
special robe, a balaband, and seven horses. His subordi-
nates, too, received favours. ‘Itimad Khan Burhanuddin
became diwan of Delhi, Mir Hidayetullah bakhshi and news-
writer, Aflatun, qiladar, ‘Abdullah Chalpi, bayutat, Nur-
ul-Haq, son of Qazi ‘Abdul Wahhab became a Qazi, Abu
S‘aid, son-in-law of the (deceased) Qazi, became darogha of
the ‘adalat ; and other officers were appointed to various posts
and sent away. [181] On Tuesday, the 9th September /13th
Shaban, the Amir-ul-umara became Subahdar of Bengal,
vice Prince Muhammad ‘Azam, and Safi Khan became that
of Agra. Farmans and robes were sent (to them) with
macebearers.

On Tuesday, the 16th September/20th Shaban,
Muhtasham Khan, faujdar of Miwat, interviewed while the
Emperor was riding. On Thursday, the 25th/29th
Shaban, the Emperor entered the Jahangiri palace on the
bank of the Andsagar lake, after visiting the tomb of Shaikh
Mu‘inuddin and presenting 5,000 rupees there,

The Emperor spent the whole month of Ramzan in
prayer. Himmat.-Khan, Subahdar of Allahabad, had
audience on Friday, the 26th September/Ist Ramzan, and
was at once sent to serve under Prince Muhammad Akbar
and presented with a special robe and a horse With gold saz; a
coloured sarpech adorned with an emerald for the Prince was
entrusted to him. On the 2nd October /7th Ramzan, a letter
accompanied by a peshkash of 400 mohars was received from
Prince Muhammad ‘Azim announcing the birth of a son to
the daughter of Kirat Singh. [182]. The child was named
Muhammad Karim. On the 4th October/19th Ramzan, a
a letter was received from Dilir Khan stating that the fort
of Mangalbida had been wrested from Shivaji.

On Sunday, the 26th October, 1679/1st Shawwal,
occurred the ‘Id-ul-fitr. * * * A farman of praise was sent
to Sujan Singh for his having captured Shivaji’s fort. Hafiz
Muhammad Amin Khan, Subahdar of Ahmadabad, had
audience, and was rewarded along with his companions.
Fakhar Khan was sent to Delhi with a robe. Tahawwar
Khan was given a robe, a quiver, a bow, and an elephant,
and sent to occupy Mandal and other parganahs. Indra
Singh was made thanadar of Nimbaj, Raghunath Singh
that of Siwanah and Dhaman, and Muhakam Singh Mertia
that of the village of Pur. On the 24th November, a letter

THE EMPEROR’S MARCH FROM AJMIR TO UDAIPUR

Emperor started from Ajmir to punish the Rana. Prirfce
Akbar, coming from Merta had audience at Deorai. [183].

1679 | PRINCE AZAM COMES FROM BENGAL 1148

MUHAMMAD ‘AZAM’S RAPID MARCH FROM BENGAL

Traversing this vast distance, in spite of its difficulties,
in obedience to the Emperor’s command, was one of the feats
of this Prince. ‘Trustworthy men who accompanied him
narrate that after midnight the Prince entered a palki and
slept. Mustafa Kashi, Lohrasp Beg, Qasim Beg and three
or four officers like them, waited on the Prince by turns.
From day-break to noon he rode on horseback, so that at
the time of his alighting not more than two or three men
were with him. Gradually the others dropped in.

He left the baggage, harem, and karkhanas with Mir
Hadi and 1,000 troopers at Patna with orders to follow him.
From Patna to Benares, which was traversed in seven days,
he was accompanied by Jahan-zeb Banu. Begam. At
Benares, Mir Khan and Shah Quli Khan Bakhshi were
ordered to convey her stage by stage under escort of 2,000
troopers; they reached (Delhi) in twenty-five days, while
the Prince by rapid marches finished the journey from
Benares in twelve days and three hours, and had audience
on Tuesday, the 16th December, 1679/28rd Zil. Q.* That
day he had travelled seventy kos.

One day when he was riding on a wretched post-horse
[184] he said to Qasim Beg, ‘‘My quiver now appears to
me heavy’’. The Khan replied ‘“This servant may remove
it’’. The Prince asked’ ‘‘What will you do with your own
quiver?’’ He replied ‘‘I shall fasten your quiver on my
back,’’ and did so. Five hundred Khush-aspa troopers
formed his retinue, and many men were favoured with the
gift of horses. Twelve troopers, four footmen, one chobdar,
one road-measurer (jarib-kash), and two time-keepers
(gharialis) who had been constantly in attendance, arrived
with the Prince.

One day, during the journey, while the Prince and his
son Bidar Bakht were riding on post-horses, under the
protection of God, the Shahzada felt very thirsty. Thev
reached a well near a village; a water-carrier presented a
cup of water, the Prince gave him two dshrafis. A villain
saw it and imagined that he was a macebearer carrying a
large number of ashrafis. He barred the road and shouted

the 12th began his journey towards Rajmahal.”’ Hughly diary, quoted in
Fort St. George, Diary and consultation book for 1679,

to the servants not to advance. The Prince did not attend
to it, and the servants did not stop at his bidding. The
wretch came forward violently. The Prince pierced him
with an arrow through the breast. The villain fell down
there and did not rise up again. The servants went on their
way. Suhrab Beg, one of the officers, who was following
the Prince like a shadow, reached the place, recognised the
arrow, [185] cut off the villain’s head, and after extracting
the arrow hastened to overtake the Prince. He showed the
arrow and uttered this couplet in the place of a prayer :

‘°To all four quarters will spread the fame of thy roval
command,
Even as thy arrow has reached the heart of thy foe.’’

After this the Prince ordered that some charn and two
anna, four anna pieces of gold and silver, copper coins and
cowries also should be kept in his pocket. At many of the
stages the officers of the jagir of Shah ‘Alam Bahadur and
other grandees brought costly horses, camels, and mules,
and presented kids and fowl. But nowhere was cooked food
procurable, except one day from the house of the Qazi of
Malpur. So he (usually) lived on dry bread, dry fruits, and
fried barley. One day the Shahzada spoke of [tasting |
khichri. The servants went to a sarai, cooked it, and
brought it in a second-hand dish or katora of wood. Both
father and son were hungry, but the Prince after a look at it,
ordered his son to eat it. He in aversion refused to eat it.
The Prince consoled him by saying, ‘‘God willing, we shall
get food from the Emperor’s own table in two or three
days.’? * * *

On the 17th December, 1679 /24th Zil. Q., Bidar Bakht
was made a 8-hazdari (2,000 tr.), ‘Abid Khan was given the
title of Qalich Khan. On Saturday, the 8rd January, 1680 /
11th Zil. H., when the Emperor marched from Mandal
[186], it was learnt that the men of the Rana had evacuated
the pass of Debari. Hafiz Muhammad Amin Khan reported
that some of his servants had ascended the hill and found
the other side of the pass also deserted; (evidently) the Rana
had evacuated Udaipur and fled. On the 4th January /12th
Zil. H., the Emperor encamped in the pass. Hasan ‘Ali
Khan was sent in pursuit of the infidel. Prince Muhammad
‘Azam and Khan Jahan Bahadur were permitted to view
Udaipur. Ruhullah Khan and Ekkataéz Khan went to

demolish the great temple in front of the Rana’s palace,
which was one of the rarest buildings of the age and the
chief cause of the destruction of life and property of the
despised worshippers. Twenty mdchdator* Rajputs were
sitting in the temple vowed to give up their lives; first one
of them came out to fight, killed some and was then himself
slain, then came out another and so on, until every one of
the twenty perished, after killing a large number of the
imperialists including the trusted slave, [khlas. The temple
was found empty. The hewers broke the images.

As Mir Shihabuddin’s luck was in the ascendant, the
Emperor summoned him when the Mir was stationed at mid-
night with a party of scouts (qaghalchis) round His
Majesty’s tent and said, ‘“‘It is some days since Hasan ‘Ali
Khan entered the pass in pursuit of the infidel. No news
has come of him. You should go and get the news.’’ With-
out any delay he set out with the party of gaghalchis to
execute the command. Inspite of his ignorance of the state
of the strange country, [187] the ups and downs, diversity
of the roads, the long distance, and the fear of robbers, he
was guided by fortune to the army of the Khan. He pro-
cured news and a letter from the Khan and immediately
returned, reaching the imperial camp at night, two days
after his starting, and had audience. Without the mediation
of Bakhshis to present him for making his bow of promotion,
he received an increment of 200 making him a 7-sadi, the
title of Khan, an elephant, and a special bow and quiver,
and was again sent to Hasan ‘Ali Khan to convev the
Emperor’s orders. This was the beginning of his advance-
ment.ft I shall hereafter narrate in the proper place only
one of the many instances of his promotion.

Sarbuland Khan Mir Bakhshi, after a long illness died

on Saturday, the 27th December, 1679/4th Zil. H. He was
a faithful officer, good inwardly and outwardly.

On Friday, the 16th January, 1680/24th Zil. H..,
Himmat Khan was sent to Allahabad. Akbar was presented
with a sarpech of ruby worth 40,000 rupees and sent to
Udaipur. A force with abundant materials and .equipment

was despatched under Hasan ‘Ali Khan to punish and
pursue the Rana ; his companions were rewarded when taking
leave. Shaikh Raziuddin, the leader of his companions, did
good service in this expedition and got the title of Khan.
Ruhullah Khan became Mir Bakhshi vice Sarbuland Khan
deceased, but the name of the post was not verbally men-
tioned. Salabat Khan [188] replaced him as darogha of
topkhana, Salih Khan becoming darogha of ghusalkhana
vice Salabat. Tahawwar Khan got the title of Padishah
Quli Khan.

News came from Lahore that Sayyid ‘Ali Akbar, Qazi
of the place, never bowed to anybody on account of his
honesty, bravery and spirit, but in contrast with him his
sister’s son Sayyid Fazil was foolish, violent and abusive
and had made the lives of the ndzim and kotwal miserable
by his words and deeds. At last they attempted his life.
The Qazi died a shameful death in the conflict with Mir
Qawamuddin Khan, the nazim. He and Nizamuddin, the
kotwal, were removed from their ranks and posts. The
kotwal was executed in Lahore and Qawamuddin was
summoned to Court. Prince Muhammad ‘Azam became
Subahdar of the Panjab vice him, and received a turban
end and jewelled muttaka. Lutfullah Khan became deputy
Subahdar, Abu Nasr Khan becoming darogha of ‘arz-1-
mukarrar vice him. Qawamuddin Khan on reaching the
Court at Ajmir, was subjected to much disgrace in the
Court of the Holy Law, till at last Sayyid ‘Ali Akbar, the
son of the deceased Qazi, at the entreaty of the grandees of
the Court gave up the demand for his execution in considera-
tion of his old age. About the same time the Khan died,
out of pity for his own condition.

On Saturday, the 24th January, 1680/2nd Muharram,
the Emperor went to view lake Udaisagar, constructed by
the Rana, and ordered all the three temples [189] on its
banks to be demolished.

News came that Hasan ‘Ali Khan having crossed the
pass on Wednesday, the 21st January/9th Zil. H., had
attacked the Rana, who had fled leaving his camp and pro-
perty behind. In this expedition much grain was captured
by the soldiers and it led to cheapness. On the 29th
January /7th Muharram, Hasan ‘Ali Khan brought to the
Emperor twenty camel-loads of tents and other things cap-
tured from the Rana’s palace and reported that one hundred

and seventy-two other temples in the environs of Udaipur
had been destroyed. The Khan received the title of Bahadur
‘Alamgirshahi. On the 31st January/Yth Muharram,
Khan Jahan Bahadur was sent to Bhainsror (cor.), and
presented with a robe, a jewelled dagger, and a horse with
gold saz.

On Monday, the 22nd February /Ist Safar the Emperor
went to view Chitor; by his order sixty-three temples of the
place were destroyed. On Friday, the 26th/5th Safar,
Khan Jahan Bahadur came from Bhainsror and had audience
at Chitor and was honoured by being presented with a half-
sleeve from the Emperor’s own person. On Sunday, the
28th February /7th Safar, Hafiz Muhammad Amin, Nazim
of Ahmadabad, was sent to his post, and given a robe, a
horse, and an elephant. On the Ist March Khan Jahan
Bahadur Zafar Jang Kokaltésh Khan became Subahdar of
the Deccan vice the eldest Prince, and was presented with
a robe, a jewelled dagger, a horse, and an elephant. Shaikh
Sulaiman, darogha of ‘adalat, got the title of Fazil Khan.
On Thursday, the 4th March /12th Safar [190] Muhammad
Akbar was appointed with a well-equipped force to guard
the environs of Chitor, and presented with a special robe,
a pearl necklace, a jewelled jigha, a horse, and an elephant.
Hasan ‘Ali Khan, Raziuddin Khan and others were re-
warded with robes and sent with the Prince. Hakim
Shamsa, who had reached the Court with the daughter of
‘Adil Khan Bijapuri, received a special robe, a horse with
gold saz, an elephant, the rank of 3-hazari (1,000 tr.), the
title of Shamsuddin Khan and posting under Khan Jahan
Bahadur.

THE EMPEROR’S RETURN FROM UDAIPUR TO AJMIR

On Saturday, the 6th March, 1680, he started from
Udaipur. ‘Abdullah Khan who had been deprived of his
annual pension, was given the rank of a 2-hazari (hazar tr.)
and made qiladar of Agra vice ‘Abdur Rasul Khan ; Mukar-
ram Khan was sent to chastise the rebels near Ranthambhor,
with a robe and an elephant.

On Tuesday, the 16th March/24th Safar, Yalangtosh
Khan Bahadur was sent to bring the Emperor’s consort,
Aurangabadi Mahal, who had been summoned to Court

servant of the days of Prince-hood, who, in consideration
of (his brother’s) long service and intimate knowledge of
the Emperor, had been brought up and favoured by His
Majesty, was led astray by his evil luck. On account of his
improper lapses [191] he- was removed from his rank of
a hazari (70 tr.) and the post of being close te the Emperor’s
person and qanungoship of the subah of Tatta, with his
son-in-law ‘Abdul Was‘i. On his application the Emperor
wrote ‘‘Go to Delhi’’. After his arrival, Fulad Khan was
ordered to confiscate his house, to place him on a horse in
the same state in which he would come out of his house, and
to expel him from the city. It was done. During his two
and a half years of close attendance on the Emperor (tagar-
rab) he had amassed twelve lakhs of rupees in cash, besides
articles and a newly-built house. All these were now con-
niscated. He went to Lahore and died there. Fazail Khan
becaine darogha of dakchauki vice Qabil Khan and his
heart’s desire was gratified. Shaikh Makhdum of Tatta,
munshi of Muhammad ‘Azam, became munshi of the
Emperor. He received the rank of 5-sadi (800 tr.), a dagger
with sadahkar, 2,000 rupees in cash, and ten pieces each of
cloth, fotah, jamawar, and kinkhab. Afterwards he rose to
be a 1%-hazari and got the title of Fazil Khan and the post of
Sadr, which he held till his death. His post under the
Prince was given to Shaikh ‘Abdul Wali, son of Shaikh
‘Abdus Samad J‘afarkhani.

On Monday, the 22nd March, the Emperor arrived at
Ajmir, and after first visiting the tomb of Khwaja
Mu‘inuddin entered the palace. [192]. Mughal Khan, son
of Tahir Khan, came from the Deccan, had audience, and
was made First Mir Tuzuk. Salabat Khan was removed
from his rank for some offence and succeeded by Bahramand
Khan in the post of darogha of topkhana. ‘Abdur Rahim
Khan replaced Bahramand as akhta begi. Hayat Beg, son
of Baqi Khan got the title of Khan, Khwaja Kamal that of
Khanjar Khan, and ‘Abdul Wahid, son of Mirza Khan,
that of Mir Khan. Kamgar Khan, son of Hushdar Khan,
who had been removed from his rank, stabbed himself in
the stomach in four places, but recovered through the kind
attention of his relatives.

On Wednesday, the 31st March, 1680/10th Rabi. A.,
Waris Khan, news-reader, who had written the third

by a mad student, whom the Khan had been taking care of
with a view to saving him from molestation by. othe, men,
and whom he made to sleep near himself at night. On
Monday, the 5th April, 1680/15th Rabi. A., a letter was
received from Shah ‘Alam Bahadur, saying that the khutba
had been read in His Majesty’s name in Bijapur, and coins
stamped in gold and silver in his name. The courtiers
bowed to express their congratulation.

On Thursday, the 6th May /16th Rabi. S., Muhammad
‘Azam advanced one stage, by command, to welcome his
sister, and conducted her and Aurangabadi Mahal to the
Emperor’s harem. The Emperor learnt that [198] Nazar
Bey the Ataliq of Subhan Quli Khan, King of Balkh, was
coming to Court. Orders were issued to pay him 5,000
rupees from the treasury of Kabul and the same sum from
that of Lahore. Qalandar Bey, envoy of Balkh, had audi-
ence and received a robe, a dagger, and 1,000 rupees in cash.
Haji Shaf‘i Khan became diwan of Bengal vice Mir Mughis,
and was succeeded by Sharif Khan as darogha of dagh and
tashtha. Hamid Khan was appointed to punish the rebels
of Sojat and Jitaran. Muhammad Mirak, macebearer, got
the title of Khan. Iftikhar Khan became faujdar of Jaunpur
vice Shuja‘et Khan, Multafat Khan who had been pre-
viously dismissed was now restored to the rank of a 3-hazari
(1,000 tr.) and appointed faujdar of Ghazipur Zamania. On
Thursday, the 20th May/1st Jamad. A., Bahramand Khan,
darogha of topkhanah, who had his quarters in a garden on
the other side of the lake of Andsagar, was sitting in the
shade of a tree, when the lightning struck (him). The Khan
jumped into a reservoir, and recovered his senses after a few
hours.

On Wednesday, the 9th June/21st Jamad. A., news
came that Khan Jahan Bahadur had reached Aurangabad
and interviewed Shah ‘Alam Bahadur, and the latter had
started for the Court. On the 14th June/26th Jamad. A.,

REBELLION OF PRINCE MUHAMMAD AKBAR
* Bd tk tk

[197] On Friday, the 7th January, 1681 /26th Zil. H.,
the Emperor learnt from the letters of spies, approved
observers and other well-informed persons that through the
instigation of the Rathors and some ungrateful imperial
servants, Prince Muhammad Akbar had rebelled, promoted
those of the imperial officers who agreed with him, and
imprisoned those whom he suspected of being unfriendly.
[198] The Emperor’s heart was deeply grieved to hear of
this sad occurrence. Relying on God’s help he turned his
attention to remedying this mischief. Bahramand Khan,
Mir Atish, was ordered to dig trenches round the army, to
place men to defend the passes, and to mount guns on the
hillocks near the imperial abode. Orders were sent to Hafiz
Muhammad Amin Khan, nazim of Ahmadabad, and other
chiefs, that they should assist each other and firmly guard
the frontiers of their provinces. At this time when the
imperial army was dispersed in the task of punishing the -
rebel [Rajputs], the only men with the Emperor were the
servants whose total number did not exceed 10,000 troopers.
The Emperor often said ‘“The hero (Akbar) has got a fine
opportunity. Why is he delaying (to attack me) ?’’

On Monday, the 10th January /29th Zil. H., during his
hunting excursion, both at the start and on return, he viewed
the mahallas (muster) of many of the commanders and the

entrenchments of ‘Umdat-ul-mulk Asad Khan and others.
‘Umdat-ul-mulk was ordered to inspect the trenches at the
end of every day. Orders were sent to imprison in the fort
of Garh-Bithli the agent of the Prince Akbar, the agents of
Shuj‘aet Khan, son of Najabat Khan, and Padishah Quli
Khan, son-in-law of ‘Inayet Khan who had misled the
Prince. Shihabuddin Khan, son of [199] Qalich Khan, had
gone towards Sirohi for punishing Sonang, Durgadas and
other Rathors who wanted to go to Gujrat. At this time the
enemy (Rajputs) in a large body came to the Prince and
guided him in his rebellion. The Prince sent Mirak Khan
to Shihabuddin to induce him with favours and gifts to join
him. The Khan had a large force with him and was at some
distance from the Prince’s army; he very wisely marched
away, rapidly covered sixty kos in two days, and joined the
Iymperor, bringing Mirak Khan with himself. Every one
of his comrades down to commanders of 200 was favoured
with interview ; he received robes, praise, and high promo-
tion which will be gradually set forth. Mirak Khan, who
had left his tent and belongings in the Prince’s camp, was
preseuted with a robe, 2,000 rupees in cash, and an incre-
ment of 200 (50 tr.). Muhammad ‘Arif, brother of Shihab-
uddin Khan, got a robe and promotion. All his subordinates,
of high and low rank alike, were rewarded with robes and
promotion. On Monday, the 10th January /30th Zil. H.,
the Emperor when riding to hunt, reviewed the troops and
the entrenchments. Hamid Khan, who had been sent with
the men of the chauki-i-khas and other troops to punish
Durjan Singh of Merta, returned by forced marches and
interviewed the Emperor while he was riding [200].

On Wednesday, the 12th January/2nd Muharram, a
letter was received from Shah ‘Alam Bahadur stating that
he had reached the lake of the Rana and was soon coming
to meet the Emperor. Asad Khan, Muhammad ‘Ali Khan
Abu Nasar Khan, and others went to reconnoitre in the
direction of the lake of Pushkar, and returned. Himmat
Khan, who was seriously ill, was left in the fort to guard
Ajmir.

On the 18th January /3rd Muharram, after performing
the Friday prayer and reading the fatiha at the tomb of
Shaikh Mu‘inuddin, the Emperor started from Ajmir, and
stopped at the camp of Deorai. Shihabuddin Khan, who had
gone forward for scouting reported that the enemy’s army
was dispersed at Kurki, therefore he had stayed there during


--- Page 135 ---
124 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI [cu. 24

the night instead of coming to the Emperor. The High
Bakhshis reported that the troops with the Emperor num-
bered 16,000 cavalry.* They were commanded to marshal
the army :—the Centre, the Vanguard and the Front Skir-
mishers together numbered 10,000, the Right and Left
Wings and the Advanced Reserve were together 6,000
strong.

Spies brought the news that the Prince was advancing
to fight the Emperor, but his soldiers were in despair, many
escaping when they got an opportunity. Kamaluddin Khan
and others came and joined the Emperor’s camp. After the
morning prayer on Sunday, the 15th January /5th Muhar-
ram, the Emperor considering it necessary to punish the
rebels, rode nearly three miles, dismounted at Doraha (cor.)
(201), and sat down within the pavilion and cloth-screens of
his touring camp (dauriya). News came in quick succession
that the enemy were coming. He said, ‘‘Don’t advance.
Let them come on.’’ After the zuhar prayer, Shah ‘Alam
Bahadur had audience. The tent, which had been at Deorai,
was brought by order and pitched for His Majesty’s
residence.

At one prahar and two gharis of night, the Emperor
was kneeling on the prayer-carpet and Shah ‘Alam Bahadur
was present, when the news came that Padishah Quli Khan,
having come from the enemy’s army, had reached the door
of the audience hall. Lutfullah Khan darogha of the
ghusalkhanah, was ordered to bring him in unarmed. The
wretch, who had evidently some wicked intention in his
mind, strongly objected to taking off his arms after reaching
the deorhi of the ghusalkhanah. Lutfullah Khan coming in
reported, ‘‘He says that he is a hereditary servant (khanah-
zad), and had never been made to enter anywhere deprived
of his arms.’’ The Emperor said, ‘‘He rfiust not come in
armed.’’ Lutfullah Khan then went back to him. He was
seized with despair, and wanted to run away. But his ingra-
titude clogged his steps. As soon as he stepped out of the
screen of the door of the ghusalkhanah, the men of the
imperial retinue and the slaves fell upon him. As he wore
cuirass and coat of mail under it, the blows produced little
effect. One struck him on the throat and silenced his dis-
turbance.

1681] AKBAR’S REBELLION COLLAPSES 125

On Saturday, the 15th January /5th Muharram, news
came that Himmat Khan, the First Bakhshi, son of Islam
Khan Bahadur of the days of Princeship, [202] had died.
He was a good man, charitable, benevolent to all; and used
to entertain in his assembly all kinds of men of learning
and skill, and reward them. Both father and son had a well-
balanced nature, and were expert in composing prose and
verse.

Before dawn on Sunday, the 16th January, 1681 /6th
Muharram, the Emperor learnt that Muhammad Akbar,
who had encamped one and a half kos from him (the
Emperor’s tent), had fled away at midnight leaving his
family and children behind. * * * * [203]. The courtiers
made their bows for this victory. Music of rejoicing was
played for three hours. Muhammad ‘Ali Khan, Khan-i-
siman, went to confiscate his stores (karkhanajat). Darbar
Khan, nazir, brought to the Emperor Nekusiyar and
Muhammad Asghar, the sons, and Safiyyat-un-nisa,
Zakiyyat-un-nisa and Najibat-un-nisa, the daughters, and
Salima Banu Begam the wife (mahal) and other relatives of
the Prince. Muhatasham Khan, the son of Shaikh Mir
deceased, M‘amur Khan, Muhammad N‘aim Khan, and
Sayyid ‘Abdullah were released from the Prince’s prison and
interviewed the Emperor receiving robes. Shihabuddin Khan,
who had gone in pursuit, killed many of the followers and
fatigued stragglers of the Prince’s party. Shah ‘Alam Baha-
dur was sent in pursuit of the Prince. Qalich Khan, Khan
Zaman, Indra Singh, Ram Singh, Sujan Singh and others
were appointed under him. Fifty thousand dshrafis were
presented to Shah ‘Alam Bahadur, two lakhs of rupees to
Prince Mu‘izzuddin, three thousand dshrafis to Prince
Muhammad ‘Azimuddin, and fifty thousand ashrafis to Shah
‘Alam’s followers. Ruhullah Khan was ordered to carry this
treasure to the Prince.

On Monday, the 17th January/7th Muharram the
Emperor returned, and after visiting the tomb of Khwaja
Mu‘inuddin entered the palace of Ajmir. On the 19th
January /9th Muharram, news came that the thanadar of
Mandal had been slain and that small fort had been captured
by the rebels. As for the men [204] who had joined Muham-
mad Akbar in revolt, it was ordered that Khwajas Manzur
and Muhrim should be imprisoned in Garh-Bithli, Murtaza
Quli in Alwar, Faraq (or Qazz4q) Khan in Gwalior, and.
Muhammad Hatim, son of Ghaznafar Khan in Kangra,

Qazi Khubullah, Muhammad ‘Aqil, Shaikh Taiyyab, and
Mir Ghulam Muhammad of Amroha, who had affixed their
seals to a decree declaring the deposition of His Majesty
as demanded by religion, were sent to fort Garh-Bithli after
being tied to planks and severely flogged. Many others were
flogged and imprisoned. Zebunnisa Begam, whose letters to
Muhaminad Akbar were discovered, was deprived of her
annual pension of four lakhs of rupees, her property was
confiscated, and she was lodged in fort Salimgarh. On the
23rd January /13th Muharram, Kambakhsh was married to
Fakhr-i-Jahan Khanam, daughter of Barkhurdar Beg, man-
sabdar. On the 26th January/16th Muharram, Auranga-
badi Mahal, Salima Banu Begam (wife of Muhammad
Akbar) and other dependents were sent to Delhi. News came
from the army of Shah ‘Alam Bahadur that he had reached
Jalor and Muhammad Akbar Sanchor, and that Qalich Khan
was hastening in pursuit with a force.

The news-writer of the army of Muhammad ‘Azam
reported that he (the Prince) having learnt that the Rana’s
diwan Dayaldas wanted to make a night attack, had sent
Dilawwar Khan against that wretch. A battle ensued ; [205]
many of the enemy were slain; after slaying his wife he
broke away; his daugliter and a few other persons were taken
prisoners. Qalich Khan who had come to Court without the
Prince’s permission, was refused audience. At first [htimam
Khan, kotwal, kept him under surveillance; then he was
made over to Salabat Khan. Muhammad Ibrahim surnamed
Shuj‘aet Khan left Akbar and came over to Shah ‘Alam,
who sent him to the Court, where he was made over to
Salabat Khan and kept under surveillance in the Akbari
palace. Hafiz Muhammad Amin Khan sent a letter stating
that Muhammad Akbar, having advanced with the Rathors
by way of the hill of Dongar to the territory of the Rana,
wanted to go to Ahmadabad ; at this time spies brought the
news that after passing by Rajpipla he had gone to the
Deccan by way of Sarangarh. Sazawar Khan was imprisoned
with his son for an offence, made over to Jalal Beg Ming-
bashi. Muhammad Shaf‘i mushrif of ghusalkhanah, who
evidently shared his guilt, was dismissed from his rank and
post. Mughal Khan became akhtabegi vice him, and Bahra-
mand Khan, Mir Tuzuk vice Mughal Khan. Mirza Muham-
‘mad, son of Murshid Quli Khan got the mushrifi of ghusal-

-;khanah. Tapidas, peshdast of Ruhullah Khan, and Bal-

received severe chastisement from the imperial army. The
thousand years’ home of the desert-rat was overturned by
the hoofs of the horses [208] of the imperialists. He fled as
far as his frontier, and then, when his powers were exhausted
and no resource was left save to beg for quarter, he begged
Prince Muhammad ‘Azam to intercede for him, offered to
cede the parganahs of Mandal-Pur and Badhnur as a substi-
tute for jazia and to interview the Prince as the means of
saving his country and property. The Prince, pitying him,
reported his requests to His Majesty, who overlooked the
Rana’s offences and resolved to gratify the Prince by acced-
ing to his proposal. Accordingly on Tuesday, the 14th
June, 1681 /7th Jamad. S., the Rana interviewed the Prince
at the lake of Rajsamudra. Dilir Khan and Hasan ‘Ali

uddin Khan.

News came from Moradabad that Faizullah Khan, son
of Zahid Khan Kokah of Padishah Begam, had died. He
had great intimacy with the Emperor, and the Begam Sahib.
He lived like one of the free, and never bowed his head in
supplication to any man. He was good, agreeable and
charitable, indifferent to the affairs of this world. His only
companions were all kinds of rare animals, beasts of prey,
wild beasts, birds, grazing cattle, and serpents, that were
procured for him from far-off countries and ports. In short,
he had an odd nature. Eventually he got elephantiasis, and
used to be carried about on an elephant. When he had to
see His Majesty, he did not come to the darbar, but inter-
viewed him while passing with his cortege. Afrasiab Khan
became faujdar of Moradabad vice him.

mad ‘Azam and Sultan Bidar Bakht returned from the war

audience. He had received (from the Rana) 4,000 rupees in
cash, two horses, 19 thans of cloth, and four camels. He
was permitted to retain them instead of surrendering them
to the State.

25TH YEAR OF THE REIGN. 1092 A. H.
4th September, 1681—23rd August, 1682.

The Emperor’s march from Ajmir to Burhanpur

On Monday, the 5th September/2nd Ramazan, the
Emperor issued orders for his camp to be moved from Ajmir
towards Burhanpur. On Thursday, the 8th/5th Ramzan,
he started from that city and halted at the stage of Deorai.
On Friday, the 9th September/6th Ramzan, Shahzada
Muhammad ‘Azim was sent back to Ajmir, after being pre-
sented with a special robe, a pearl smarani, a jewelled
dagger, a sword, a horse, and an elephant [213]. ‘Umdat-
ul-mulk Asad Khan was appointed to accompany him, and
received a special robe, a jewelled dagger, and «a horse.
‘Itiqad Khan, son of Asad Khan, Kamialuddin Khan, son of
Dilir Khan, Raja Bhim and his son, Dindar Khan, son of
Namdar Khan (who became Marhamat Khan) and others,
after being given robes, jewels, horses and elephants were
appointed to this army. ‘Inayet Khan, faujdar of Ajmir, and
Sayyid Yusuf Bukhari, qila‘dar of Garh Bithli, were sent
back. On Saturday, the 10th September/7th Ramzan,
news came from Delhi that Jahanara Banu Begam had died
on Tuesday, the 6th September, 1681/3rd Ramzan. She
was buried in the compound of the sepulchre of Shaikh
Nizam-ud-din Aulia, where she had constructed her own
tomb in her lifetime. The Emperor was very sorry to hear of
the death of his loving eldest sister and forbade the beating of
naubat for three days. This lady, now wrapped up in divine
forgiveness, was endowed with the gracious quality of
charity and the noble trait of benevolence. She always took
care to be polite in her manners to her equals and bestowed
her gifts and compassion on the general public. (With her
death) the shade of bounty was withdrawn from the head
of the world, and the store of liberality disappeared from
the hand of the age. The Emperor ordered her title to be
written as Sdhibat-wz-zamani, * * * *

1683] ELLORA CAVES DESCRIBED 145

On the 15th September /3rd Shawwal, as commanded
by His Majesty, the advance-tents of Shah ‘Alam Bahadur
came out of Aurangabad, playing sweet music, with the
object of extirpating the enemy in the direction of Konkan
and Ramdarah and other lands of the Marathas.

Dilir Khan Afghan died of severe illness. He had
fought well in many battles. He was a powerfully built man
and of great strength. He had a wonderful appetite, control
over his clansmen, and good luck all through his life.

I shall now give some description of the tombs of the
saints of the Faith and the village of Ellora. Eight kos
from Aurangabad and three kos from the fert of Daulatabad
are the blessed tombs of Shaikh Burhanuddin, Shaikh Zain-
ul-Haq, Shaikh Muntakhabuddin Zar-bakhsh, Mir Hasan
[238] of Delhi, Sayyid Raju, father of Mir Sayyid Muham-
mad Gisudaraz and other knowers of God, many of whom
were followers of Nizamuddin Aulia. These are places of pil-
grimage to the world. These holy men came to this country
and repose here, through the exertions of Muhammad Shah
Malik Juna, son of Tughlaq, who considered the fort of
Deogiri the centre of his kingdom, named it Daulatabad,
wished to make it his capital, and removed the people of
Delhi with their families to this place.

A short distance from here is a place named Ellora
where in ages long past, sappers possessed of magical skill
excavated in the defiles of the mountain spacious houses for
a length of one kos. On all their ceilings and walls many
kinds of images with lifelike forms have been carved. The
top of the hill looks level, so much so that no sign of the
buildings within it is apparent (from outside). In ancient
times when the sinful infidels had dominion over this
country, certainly they and not demons (jinn)* were the
builders of these caves, although tradition differs on the
point ; it was a place of worship of the tribe of false believers.
At present it is a desolation in spite of its strong founda-
tions ; it rouses the sense of warning (of doom) to those who
contemplate the future (end of things). In all seasons, and
particularly in the monsoons, when this hill and the plain
below resemble a garden in the luxuriance of its vegetation
and the abundance of its water, people come to see the place.

Md. Amin went from Agra to Kabul, he requested Bakhta-
war Khan to present him to the Emperor for service. After

Akbar. His ability made him rise to the post of darogha
of filkhanah under that Prince. After Akbar’s revolt he
went to Haidarabad. There he bragged of being a high
person connected with great amirs and thus influenced Abul
Hasan and his ministers, and got the title of ‘Ain-ul-mulk.

his false pretensions. He had no help but to come on the
embassy. At the audience Bakhtawar Khan said to the
Emperor, ‘‘This man [245] is so and so.’’ The Emperor
said, ‘‘See the mischievousness of Abul Hasan! He has sent
Akbar’s officer as envoy to me.’’ J‘afar knew me and sent
a message asking me to see him. After beholding his
splendour, wealth and prodigality in the market as a buyer, I
sent to him to ask ‘‘Why did you come here ?’’ He said, ‘‘The
desire of seeing (old) friends brought me here.’’ I replied,
‘‘You have acted very ill.’? After two days the kotwal all
of a sudden went to his house, brought him to the chabutra,
and confiscated his household furniture and slaves, with
much cash. After a time he was given the rank of a 3-sadi

Bahadur Zafar Jang Kokaltash, Dilir Khan, Ghaziuddin
Khan Bahadur, and other high grandees [246] and warriors
had up to this time captured from the enemy and added to

Jamad. A., Sarbuland Khan (Khwaja Y‘aqub) died.

DESCRIPTION OF THE CITY AND FORT OF AHMADNAGAR

The fort of Ahmadnagar is situated on a plain; for
giving it firmness and strength, the foundation of this hill-
like fort has been sunk to the lowest stratunr of the earth.
It would not be wrong to say that this nail of the hill had
been inserted to prevent earthquakes. Around the fort is
a champaign. Within the fort are buildings and fresh
gardens, under which cellars of great rarity have been built.
Around the fort is a deep ditch ever full of water. Two
canals come into the fort from outside. [257] The city of
Ahmadnagar is situated a quarter kos from the fort; it has
no defensive wall. Formerly it was without an equal for
its buildings, the abundance of canal water in every house,
and the extent of habitation. The late Danishmand Khan,
who had passed some time here when he was a merchant,
used to say that Ahmadnagar excels Kashmir in many
points. In the environs of the city are the gardens of
Farah-bakhsh and Bihisht-bagh, which present a wonderful
spectacle. They were built by Salabat Khan during the
period of the insanity of Murtaza Nizamulmulk, in his
name. In order to preserve their memory I shall give the
length and breadth of these two gardens and a a description
of their buildings which are rare.

The garden of Farah-bakhsh is 2000 zir‘a in length and
breadth (alike) which makes (the area) 278 bighas. In the
middle of it is a reservoir 528 ziva (square), which makes
the area 19 bighas. An underground channel brings water
to it from the foot of the hill. In the centre of the reservoir
is a lofty and wonderful building in two storeys, having
160 hujra (rooms) and a high cupola. Archers practise
shooting at its summit. Bihisht-bagh is 312 zir‘a in length
and breadth alike which makes the area 100 bighas. In the
middle is an octagonal reservoir, which is also fed with canal
water. In the centre is a building now in ruins. On the bank
of the reservoir are a charming building and ‘a neat Turkish
bath, fit for the residence of elegant people.

Five kos from the fort is a halting place (manzil),
known as Manjar Samba or Manzil ‘Saba. It is said that a


--- Page 169 ---
158 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRi [cH. 28

high building has been constructed in the waist of the hill.
The fountain of the garden leaps up of itself incessantly to a
height of 100 yards, through the force of the water that
comes from a spring in the hill. The Emperor [258] visited
this ‘‘flower of the earth’’ and ordered the ruined houses to
be repaired. The tomb of Salabat Khan situated on the top
of the hill, is a wonderful building. The climate of this
tract is not very hot; at night one has to use coverlets.

‘THI EMPEROR’S MARCH FROM AHMADNAGAR TO SHOLAPUR

On Sunday, the 26th April, 1685/2nd Jamad. S., the
imperial camp moved from Ahmadnagar, on an auspicious
day and hour, and was pitched near the Farah-bakhsh
garden. On Wednesday the 29th April/5th Jamad. S., the
Emperor went there.

On the 30th Sayyid Ughlan got the title of Siadat
Khan. This noble-minded Sayyid, the tutor of Firuz
Jang Khan, had come to Hindustan from Persia (vild@yat)
with him, and had the fortune of being enrolled in the
Emperor’s service, and rose to honour and high position
through the Emperor’s favour.

Qazi Sayyid Abu Sa‘id, owing to some ailments, begged
hard to resign his high office, [added from ms. ]. Arjunji,
uncle’s son of Sambha was made a 2-hazari (1000 tr.) and
presented with a robe and a horse. ‘Izzatullah Khan was
appointed qiladar of Ahmadnagar. On Friday, the Ist
May /2nd Jamad.S., Firuz Jang Bahadur was sent to stay,
at Ahmadnagar and presented with an amulet containing
the Quran, a special robe, and 20,000 rupees. His com-
panions were rewarded with robes and daggers. Khwaja
‘Abdullah [259] son of Muhammad Sharif, who had been
the Qazi of the Emperor’s army before his accession, became
Qazi of the Court. On Saturday, the 28rd May / 29th
Jamad. S., Qamruddin, son of Firuz Jang, got the title of
Khan. On Sunday, the 24th May/1st Rajab, the Emperor
reached Sholapur. ‘Itiqgad Khan was sent towards
Zafarabad [Bidar], receiving a special robe, a quiver, and
a bow; his followers got robes, swords, and: horses.
Bahramand Khan was ordered to hasten toward Haidarabad.
On Saturday, the 30th May/7th Rajab, when Shah ‘Alam
Bahadur was coming to Court on horseback, a man ran

towards him with an uplifted sword; he was seized and
made over to the Prince’s kotwal, by imperial command.

ARMY SENT UNDER SHAH ‘ALAM BAHADUR
AGAINST ABUL, HASAN.

As the Emperor had ordered that Muhammad M‘asum
and Muhammad J‘afar, servants of Haidarabad, who were
staying in the imperial camp as envoys, should lodge in the
quarters of Ihtamam Khan, kotwal, and that the letters
they wrote to Haidarabad and received from that place,
should be first shown to the Khan, and [260] that he
should report to the Emperor if he found anything worth
reporting, spies worked hard to get news (of the enemy).
As the time for the destruction of the Haidarabadi ruler
had come near, a letter from Abul Hasan reached his
servants, saying ‘‘His Majesty is a great man, and has
acted like the great up to this time. But now that finding
Sikandar (‘Adil Shah) an orphan and powerless, he has
besieged Bijapur and pressed him hard, it is proper that,
besides the large army of Bijapur, Raja Sambha should
exert himself with a countless host to aid this helpless king
from one side, and I should appoint 40,000 tr. under the
command of Khalilullah Khan Palang-hamla to conduct the
war, and see on which side the Emperor can encounter and
resist his many enemies. You, who have been detained
near the kotwali chabutra, should not be alarmed at the
news, as your release would come about soon’’. The Khan
sent this letter to the Emperor. Therefore on Sunday, the
28th June, 1685/6th Shaban, the Prince was sent against
Haidarabad, receiving a special robe, a jewelled dagger, a
muttaka, and twenty horses. His sons and high officers
were favoured with robes, jewels, horses, elephants, and
promotion. On the 15th July /23rd Shaban Ruhullah Khan,
coming from Bijapur was sent to Ahmadnagar in the place
of Firuz Jang Bahadur. Kamgar Khan became darogha of
the retinue vice Khanahzad Khan, and Mukhtar Khan
darogha of the stable vice the first-named and was sent on
Sunday, the 19th July/27th Shaban, to convey a dagger
having a jasper hilt with ‘ilaqa, [261] and phul katara to
‘Azam Shah and a smarani of pearl, a punchhi, and rain-
coat (farghal) for Prince Bidar Bakht. Mughal Khan,
nazim of Malwa, died on Tuesday, the 14th July /22nd

Shaban, and Tarbiyat Khan, faujdar of Jaunpur on the
19th /27th Shaban. Mir ‘Abdul Karim was punished for an
offence by being removed from the darogha-ship of ja-namaz-
khanah, Muhammad Sharif khawds of the touring camp
(cor. I taking his place.

The Emperor said, ‘‘I had at first put off the chastise-
ment of this vendor of China-ware, this ape-like buffoon
and this drummer [Qutb Shah]. Now that this hen has
come forward crowing, I can’t wait any longer.’’ Inspite of
the delay and hitch which it would cause to the Bijapur
expedition the Prince was ordered to extirpate the wretch.
Khan Jahan Bahadur Zafar Jang, who was staying at the
thanah of Indi for conveying provisions to the army of
Shah ‘Alijah [‘Azam], was ordered to join the army of the
Prince and exert himself much in rendering good service.

22nd July, 1685—11th July, 1686.

Bd a EY *

[262] Sikandar Bey, who had come from Persia
(vilayat) to Court, received a robe, a jewelled dagger and
10,000 rupees. Amanullah Khan, son of Alahwardi Khan
and Fath M‘amur Khan son of Dilir Khan died fighting

A mourning robe for Amanulla Khan was sent to Hasan
‘Ali Khan Bahadur ‘Alamgirshahi. The powder magazine
of the army of Muhammad ‘Azam Shah caught fire; nearly
500 bahalias (hill-climbing infantry) and musketeers were
killed.

On Thursday, the 138th August/23rd Ramzan, Irij

of the army under ‘Azam Shah, died. Firuz Jang Bahadur,

21

The Emperor learnt of a famine in the army of
Muhammad ‘Azam Shah; it was so severe that a grain of
wheat laid the snare of seduction for a hundred Adams, and
in the fear that the lack of gram would render them weak,
all the soldiers felt themselves helpless. Every day severe
fighting took place, in the trenches and also with the out-
lying troops. The soldiers had no sleep and food, the two
sustainers of life. Death rode rampant. There came no
food from any side. A letter ‘‘By order’? was written to
the Prince saying, ‘‘As you have come to such a pass, return
to the Court with your army.’’ The Prince after receiving
the letter held a council of consultation with his chief officers.
First he turned to Hasan ‘Ali Khan Bahadur ‘Alamgir-
shahi and said, ‘‘The carrying out of the expedition depends
on the co-operation of the officers. I have received such a
letter from the Emperor. Your advice is important in these
matters of peace and war, haste and delay. [264] You have
seen and undergone many difficulties and hardships of this
kind. What is your view of this case?’?’ The -Khan
replied, ‘‘In view of the good of the army and happiness of
the people at large, I think a retreat is advisable. When in
the Balkh campaign, Prince Murad Bakhsh owing to the
rigour of winter could not stay there, he had to give up sieges
and battles by order of Shah Jahan and return to Court.
What our men are undergoing is known; and your Highness
has received the order to retreat.’’ After this the Prince
turned to the others; they all supported the Khan. The
Prince then said, ‘‘You have spoken for yourselves. Now
hear from me! Muhammad ‘Azam with his two sons and
Begam will not retreat from this dangerous place so long as
he has life. After my death, His Majesty may come and
order the removal of my corpse for funeral. My companions
may stay or go away as they like.’’ Then they all said
in concert, ‘‘Our opinion is the same as your Highness’s.”’
When the Emperor learnt of this determination of the
Prince to stay, he ordered Firuz Jang Bahadur on Monday,
the 4th October, 1685/16th Zil. Q., to set out with a large
army and provisions beyond calculation [265] to reinforce
and supply the Prince’s army. The Emperor excused the
branding of the horses of the 3rd and 4th fractions of their
contingents in the case of the sadi and 4-sadi in attendance
on the Emperor and mansabdars out on expedition. The
imperial officers were ordered to buy for the State horses
after taking them out of dagh and send them to the Prince,


--- Page 174 ---
1635 | _ SIEGE OF BIJAPUR, AZAM RELIEVED 163

for distribution to the men who had lost their horses in
action. Firuz Jang, on the day of taking leave, was
presented with a robe, the mahi, and an elephant for carrying
it, four banners (nishan) and four hairy (two-humped) camels
for carrying them, and was permitted to kiss the feet of the
Emperor, who stroked him on the back with his hand. His
officers were favoured with robes, horses, elephants, and
promotion. Firuz Jang reached the Prince with the speed
of lightning, and the famished army gained the hope of life.
The Shah appointed his revived troops to punish the enemy
who used to sally out of the fort for fight.

It happened by chance that when Firuz Jang was
staying at Rasulpur in the environs of Bijapur, six thousand
infantry, sent by the wretched Pam Naik with provisions
carried on the head in aid of Bijapur, were advancing by
stealth at night, and arrived at this place at midnight,
thinking that a Bijapuri force must be staying so near the
fort. Firuz Jang, who had been informed of it by spies,
seized the opportunity; [266] and fell upon them before
dawn; no living creature escaped from the Mughal swords
with his life; a crushing defeat was inflicted on the enemy.
Sixty-two mansabdars sent by Firuz Jang to convey the
heads of the enemy received a reward of 2,000 rupees. A
mohar weighing 1,000 mohars was sent to Firuz Jang.

On Saturday, the 10th October, 1685/22nd Zil. Q.,
‘Itiqad Khan was sent as thanahdar of Indi up to the bank
of the Bhima. Of his comrades Sayyid Nur-ul-bahar of
Barha got the title of Saif Khan and others robes, horses
and elephants, at the time of their departure.

Marhamat Khan was sent as thdnaldar of Mudgal
between Zafarabad [Bidar] and Haidarabad; his followers
were rewarded with robes, horses, elephants and cash.
Pahar Singh Gaur, who had caused disturbances near
Ujjain attacked with a large force Muluk Chand, naib and
officer of ‘Azam Shah, who had ridden out to punish him.
After a stiff fight an arrow hit the rebel, and he died.
Muluk Chand’s letter reporting this victory was shown to
the Emperor. The courtiers bowed and invoked blessings.
Robes were presented to Fazail Khan, who had previously
learnt of the matter from the letter of a secret-writer and
reported it to the Emperor, to ‘Inadyetullah, agent, who
presented Muluk Chand’s letter to the Emperor, and ‘Abdul
Hakim, a servant of the Prince, who brought the rebel’s
head to the Emperor. [267] His Majesty ordered the head


--- Page 175 ---
164 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMCIRI [cH. 29

to be sent to the Prince. Muluk Chand was rewarded with
the title of Rai-i-Raian, a robe, and promotion making him
in all a 7-sadi.

CONQUEST OF HAIDARABAD BY SHAH ‘ALAM BAHADUR

On Sunday, the 18th October, 1685/30th Zil. Q.,
despatches from Shah ‘Alam Bahadur and Khan Jahan
Bahadur announcing the capture of the city of Haidarabad,
the shutting up of Abul Hasan in the fort of Golkonda, the
interview of Ibrahim, the enemy’s commander-in-chief (who

courier, Sharif-ul-mulk, Abul Hasan’s sister’s husband, and
others with the prince, the recommendation of mansab for
each of them, and the arrival of Abul Hasan’s supplicatory

officer of the Prince. The courtiers made their bow of
thanks-giving for the victory; joyous music was played.
The Emperor ordered Abul Hasan’s letter to be shown
to him. Mirza Muhammad Shirazi,* son of Hakim
Fathuddin, and uncle of Hakim Muhasan Khan, presented
to the Emperor the following verse as embodying the date

40-hazari (30,000 tr.). Mir ‘Abdul Karim, the ex-darogha of
of the ja-namaz-khanah, was ordered to carry robes and
jewels to the Prince, his sons, Khan Jahan, Ibrahim, sar-i-
lashkar, and the high grandees serving under the Prince.
Muhammad Shaf‘i, mushrif of deorhi, Alah Yar, mushrif
of the qarawwals, Mir Hashim, servant of the Prince, Sayyid
Abu Muhammad son of Munawwar Khan, and Kalyan, son
of Hira mason were travelling together on the way to their
work. When. they arrived at Mangal, four kos from
Haidarabad, Shaikh Nizam Haidarabadi with a numberless
forcé appeared like a flood coming on to sweep away houses.
Though these men had not such a force with them as to be
able to resist, yet they fought valiantly, and excepting
Mir ‘Abdul Karim who fell down wounded [269] and was
afterwards catried off as a prisoner, all the others perished.

Najabat Khan and Asalat Khan, sons of Sayyid Muzaffar,
who had been sent with an escort from Zafarabad supplied
by Qalich Khan, fled after some fighting, on account of
their previous understanding with the enemy, and joined
Shaikh Nizim. Many men who had joined them like a
caravan and not for any other reason, were slain. The
enemy captured the jewels and robes sent by the Emperor
and other articles, including the property of the merchants
and travellers. After four days Mir ‘Abdul Karim was
conveyed by the men of Abul Hasan from Golkonda to the
camp of the Prince on the border of the city of Haidarabad
and then they disappeared. Muhammad Murad Khan
envoy (hajib), getting news of it, carried him to his own
house. In a few days his wounds healed; he interviewed
the Prince, reported to him the orders verbally sent to the
Prince through him, and then took his leave. He reached
the Court with Khan Jahan Bahadur, who had been

THE EMPEROR’S MARCH FROM SHOLAPUR TO CAPTURE
THE FORT OF BIJAPUR

* * * *

As Sikandar (‘Adil Shah) was not befriended by the
happy arrival of Khizir,* he could not reach the elixir vite
of dominion. The sharers of his power, [276] appointed
Siddi Mas’aud, ‘Abdur Rauf, and Sharza the general, to
exercise control over him and they treated him as of no
account. Persisting in self-will and haughtiness, they even
quarrelled among themselves; the king could not leave the
city, but oppressed the citizens. Having come under the
influence of the infidel Sambha, he used to be his co-sharer
in harming the Muslims. He considered the strong fort
of Bijapur as his refuge in evil days.

One day Shaikh Muhammad Nagshbandi of Sirhind
had audience. In course of conversation he said, ‘‘I have
heard that Your Majesty wants to march against Bijapur’’.
The Emperor replied, ‘‘The only benefit which we kings
derive from our position in the world is the gaining of fame.
I had wished that one of my sons would gain it; but it is
not to be. I therefore, wish to go (in person) and see what
sort of barrier this wall is that it is not being removed from
before us.’’ On Monday, the 14th June, 1686 /2nd Shaban,
the imperial standards moved from Sholapur in that direc-
tion. On Saturday, the 26th June/14th Shaban, Prince
Muhammad ‘Azam and Bidar Bakht [277] had audience,
and received robes. Bahadur Khan and Rado Anup Singh,
son of Rao Karn, got robes on interview. On Saturday,
the 3rd July /21st Shaban, when the imperial camp reached
Rasulpur, three kos from Bijapur, Firuz Jang Bahadur had
audience, and after receiving 30,000 rupees, ten horses
worth 9,500 rupees, an elephant with silver saz, and a
special robe, was sent to the post of Bidar Bakht. His
son Qamruddin Khan received a jewelled dagger with pearl
‘ilaqga. On Sunday, the 4th July/22nd Shaban the
Emperor ordered the trenches to be advanced, the towers to
be overthrown by cannonade, and the moat to be filled up.

*A play upon the name Stkandar=Alexander the Great, who, guided
by the prophet Khizir, traversed the dark wilderness (zulmat) and reached
the spring of the water of life, by tasting which he became a world-conqueror,

380TH YEAR OF THE REIGN: 1097 A.H.

12th July, 1686—30th June, 1687.

[278] Nawazish Khan was made faujdar and qiladar
of Mandasor, receiving a robe. Suhrab Khan was given a
jewelled jigha. Sarafraz Khan and Daud Khan got robes
at interview. Abul Khair, son of Shaikh Nizam, became
darogha of jaé-namaz-khanah vice Muhammad Sharif, and I
(the author) became mushrif (of that department) vice
Dindér. Muhammad Mumin, son-in-law of [rij Khan, was
appointed naib subahdar of Berar vice Raziuddin Khan
deceased, who had been administering the province as the
deputy of Hasan ‘Ali Khan and had fallen down dead while
talking with his soldiers. On Saturday, the 21st August,
1686 /11th Shawwal, Qalich Khan was appointed to the
trenches after receiving a bow and a quiver. Kamaluddin
Khan, son of Dilir Khan, recovered from his wounds, inter-
viewed and received a robe, a sword, and a mace (‘asa) set
with jasper. ‘Itiqad Khan coming from Ahmadnagar, had
audience. Raja Bhim Singh came from Ajmir by command
and had audience.

On Saturday, the 4th September/25th Shawwal, the
Emperor rode to the edge of the moat, in order to inspect
the battery which had been raised opposite the turret
(kangurah) of the fort, and to learn the reason why the
conquest was still delayed. Great noise was made by the
cortege, and rockets.and muskets began to be fired with
great noise from the fort. [279] Flaming cannon-balls
passed over His Majesty’s head. Mir ‘Abdul Karim,
through his ingenuity, composed an extempore hemistich
embodying the date, ‘‘Bijapur will be soon conquered’’,
which he showed to the Emperor after scrawling it on a bit
of paper with a lead pencil. The Emperor took it as a good
omen and said, ‘‘God grant it be so!’’ Thank God, the
capture of the fort was accomplished that very week. On
Saturday, the 11th September, 1686/8rd Zil. Q., the slave
Jalal was rewarded with the title of Sarbarah Khan for his

excellent work in trenching. As the imperial warriors had
collected in two months and twelve days all the materials
necessary for destroying the enemy, Sikandar and his
companions, seeing death near, begged pardon for their
faults and cried for quarters. On Sunday, the 12th
September, 1686/4th Zil. Q., the fort was captured by
‘Alamgir, and all the people of the country, high and low
alike, were glorified by coming under the Emperor’s rule.
The banners of Islam, which had been turned upside down
in this country for a long time, again uplifted their heads.
From every side of the earth the cry ‘‘Truth came and false-
hood vanished’’ rose to the vault of the sky.

The Emperor graciously [280] accepted the prayer of
Sikandar, who thus escaped the imperial wrath (for his
misdeeds.) He was granted an interview in the Public
Audience-hall, and presented with a special robe, a jewelled
dagger with pearl ‘ilaga and phul katara worth 700 rupees,
a pearl necklace with emerald pendant worth 13,000 rupees,
a jewelled kalgi, and a jewelled ‘asd. He was given the title
of Sikandar Khan and an annual pension of one lakh of
rupees. A tent was fitted up for his residence within the
gulalbar, and supplied with all necessary articles. Sikandar
Bey, who held the title of Sikandar Khan, had the letter
alif added to his name (i.e., became Iskandar Khan).
‘Abdur Rauf and Sharza came to interview, each receiving
a robe, a sword, a jewelled dagger with pearl ‘ilaga, a horse
with gold saz, an elephant with silver saz, and the rank of
6-hazari (same tr.). The first was entitled Dilir Khan, the
second Rustam Khan. To Mahabat Khan, Sharif-ul-mulk,
Mukhtar Khan and Sarafraz Khan elephants were presented,
to Qalich Khan a dagger and a horse, to Lutfullah Khan
and Ghaznafar Khan ‘banner and tugh, to Saf Shikan
Khan kettledrums, to Himmat Khan a sword with jewelled
saz, to Qamruddin Khan a jewelled dagger. [281] The
Emperor in his presence graciously permitted Umdat-ul-
mulk Asad Khan to sit cross-legged on a cushion. Khwaja
Wafa, darogha of the sukh-sajya-khanah (cosy bed) carried
to him a masnad, a gold-woven sofa, (takia-gah) and a
suzani ornamented with gold-embroidered figures, and
received (from the Khan) a robe and 1,000 rupees. The
Emperor permitted him to keep the money.

Hasan ‘Ali Khan Bahadur ‘Alamgirshahi died of
severe illness. He was a matchless hero and commander,
unique in benevolence to all, truthfulness of speech, and

goodness of action. His sons, Muhammad Muqim and
Khairullah, received robes. Mahabat Khan became Sub-
ahdar of Berar vice the deceased, and was presented with a
robe, a steel coat of armour (zarah), a helmet, rak shalwar
(trousers) and du-balgha. Muhammad Sadiq became his
deputy.

On Sunday the 19th September/1ith Zil.Q., the
Emperor’s tent was moved from Rasulpur to the tank
half a kos from the fort and opposite the gate of Alapur.
That day he rode out to view the citadel, the buildings
and outer breastwork of the city-wall. On Friday the 17th
Sept. /9th Zil. Q., Ashraf Khan, Mir Bakhshi, died; with
him withered the rose in the ‘garden of correct under-
standing and rapid writing. Ruhullah Khan became First
Bakhshi vice him, and Bahramand Khan Second Bakhshi
vice Ruhullah, while Bahramand was succeeded by Kamgar
Khan as darogha of ghusalkhanah; Kamgar’s place of First
Mir Tuzuk was taken by Qasim Khan. [282] Mourning
robes were conferred on Muhammad Husain and Muhammad
Baqr, brother’s sons of Ashraf Khan. In the night of 25th
September /17th Zil.Q., the Emperor summoned Sikandar
to his presence, kindly requested him to sit down, and
presented him with a diamond sarpech and three packets of
betel-leaf. * * * Ruhullah Khan was appointed nazim of
Bijapur, which was now named Dar-ul-Zafar, and he was
made a 5-hazari (4,000 tr.) by an increment of a haziri zat
and troopers. ‘Azizullah Khan became qiladar, Muhammad
Raf‘i diwan, S‘adat Khan bakhshi and news-writer, Siddi

Sikandar Khan got a present of 10,000 rupees. Khanahzid
Khan was sent towards Miraj. Himmat Khan Bahadur
son of Khan Jahan Bahadur was made Subahdar of
Allahabad; he was a 23-hazari (2,200 tr.) and received

son-in-law J‘afar accompanying him as the diwan of that
mahal. [283] The Khan got an elephant. Ikhlaskesh
became pesh-dast of the Mir Bakhshi vice Yar ‘Ali Beg, who
became peshdast of the second bakhshi. Raja Anup Singh

On Saturday, the 23rd October /15th Zil. H., 150 mohars
were presented to sixteen men of the family of Sikandar
Khan, the fingers of whose left hand had been cut off and
who had thus been excluded from the succession according
to the agreement of their grandfathers; these men were
ordered to stay at Sholapur with their children and families,
stipends being granted to each. Sipahdar Khan, son of
Khan Jahan Bahadur became Subahdar of Lahore vice
Mukarram Khan. ‘Itiqad Khan was detached to punish the
force sent by Sambha, which had spread near Mangalbeda
and was presented with a jewelled crest (kalgt) with par-
khanah of heron’s feather.

RETURN OF THE EMPEROR FROM BIJAPUR TO SHOLAPUR

On Saturday, the 80th October, 1686/22nd Zil. H.,
the Emperor left Bijapur [284] and reached Sholapur, on
Tuesday, the 2nd November/25th Zil. H. He ordered
Sikandar Khan to be brought with the cortege of the ladies
of the imperial harem, and his mahi-maratib, umbrella and
other insignia of kingship to be deposited in the store-room.
That day Firuz Jang was sent to capture fort Ibrahimgarh
in Haidarabad, and presented with a special robe and an

of Mecca, after being given a robe, a dagger, a horse and
3000 rupees, was permitted to depart. ‘Aisha, daughter of
Sikandar Khan was presented with a cap with pearls
attached. Mir ‘Abdul Karim became Amin of the seven
chaukis for the second time.

THE EMPEROR MARCHES FROM SHOLAPUR
TOWARDS HAIDARABAD

Abul Hasan, the ruler of Haidarabad, was stupid and
sunk in sinful lust; misled by his evil fortune, he shut his
eyes to the sins punishable in the next world, and made the
vagabond Hindus the managers and administrators of the
affairs of his State, and gave currency to the rites of that
accursed race. And, those travellers in the wrong path of
futile wandering and ignorance, those carrion-eating demons
(ghul) of the wilderness, (namely) the Persians (i.c., Shias)
with the support of that worthless sect (the Hindus) began
to practise there publicly all kinds of shameful sins. No
respect was left for Islam and its adherents; mosques were
without splendour, while idol-temples flourished; the
requisites of canonical practice remained closed under bolts,
while the gates of irreligious practices (bida‘t) were flung
open. In the excess of his intoxication with the wine of
negligence, Abul Hasan did not distinguish the night from
the day; thanks to his addiction to evil company and his
badness of aims, he refused to prefer Faith te Infidelity. In
the many kinds of injury that the hellish Sambha had
inflicted on worshippers of the True God, Abul Hasan
became his helper and ally. On seeing a single (really) un-
substantial frown and on hearing one vain threat (from that
Maratha king), what vast sums did he not send to that
enemy, and simply through his meanness of spirit and
cowardice kept himself safe from plunder by that
man? [286]

This Emperor of Emperors is the asylum of Muslims.
He honours none but the people of the true Faith ; he injures
none but the infidels and heretics (ahal-i-bid‘at) ; the sharp-
ness of his sword has cleansed the face of the earth from
the filth of the blood of disturbers ; although he has conquered
with his bright sword strong forts, the spring-breeze alone
can* open the buds in the garden. Our Emperor’s zeal

“JI have omitted the negative particle of the text, in order to make
sense of the passage.


--- Page 186 ---
1686 | ABUL HASAN QUTB SHAH’S SINS 175
for the Faith and his delicate sense of honour as a master
of the world, persuaded him that, inspite of his wielding a
world-conquering sword, he ought first of all, by following
the generous policy of admonition and direction, try to
remove the cotton-wool of heedlessness stuffing the ears of
Abul Hasan, and open the gates of entrance into the Islamic
land of right guidance before the face of that unlucky man.
His Majesty repeatedly sent messages full of advice and
good counsel to that wretched fellow urging him to abandon
his alliance with the infernal infidel enemies (of Aurangzib
and Islam), his vicious attachment to practitioners of
irreligious acts (heresy, bid‘a), and the sins of appointing
Brahmans as his ministers (peshkar), in giving help (in the
form of money and troops) to the hostile misbelievers
(kafirs), the promotion of various degrees of prohibited
practices [such as drinking wine] and tieading the open
path of cherishing vain ideas (of independence). The result
(of listening to this advice) would be that his innocent
subjects would not be helplessly trodden under the feet of
the imperial cavalry and he himself would personally
remain safe from the tempest of overthrow and humiliation.
But as Fortune had deserted him, Ruin instigated him (to
refuse). He gave his house up to plunder (at Haidarabad)
by the army of Prince Muhammad Mu‘azzam, who had
been appointed to guide him to the right path of sub-
mission, At that time, Abul Hasan by procrastination, 7.e.,
by deceiving the Prince with promises and flattery and
clouding his intellect with many kinds of fraud and spells,
secured his release from the grasp of the Prince, and made
the increase of his treasure [287] and troops and the
strengthening of the four walls of his fort (Golkonda) the
veil over the eyes of his knowledge and the lock on his
pardon-begging tongue.

Therefore the Emperor had no help but to act according
to the verses :—

You should fondle the heads of asses with the stick in
your hand,

When they set their refractory steps outside the
right path.

On Sunday, the 5th December, 1686 /29th Muharram,
the Emperor started from Sholapur to visit the tomb of
Mir Sayyid Muhammad Gisudaraz at Ahsanabad Gulbarga,


--- Page 187 ---
176 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI [cx. 80

He repeatedly visited the holy place. Twenty thousand
rupees were presented to the representatives of the holy saint
and the residents including the hermits and beggars. After
passing a week there, the camp moved towards Zafarabad
Bidar, where it stayed for twenty days, in the vain hope
that Abul Hasan would come to his senses. But the latter
was not guided by Providence to such good fortune. There-
fore at last on Friday, the 14th January, 1687/10th
Rabi. A., the Emperor mounted his horse to punish that
luckless man. When Abul Hasan heard of it, he in terror
of the imperial army, could think of no place of refuge save
his fort. So he shut himself up in it and remained
bewildered with his face to the wall, like a picture, lips
despairing of laughter, eyes full of tears, head vacant of
sense, tongue speechless. At this time, [288] when the
day of his destruction had drawn near, he wished to submit
and make a new protestation of fidelity * * *. The Emperor
did not assent to his prayers: the only reply given to him
was the sword. ‘The Emperor advanced and then halted
two stages from Haidarabad. Firuz Jang who had been
sent from Bijapur to conquer Ibrahimgarh, hastened to the
Court by way of Haidarabad after accomplishing his task.
Despatches from him were now received announcing that
he had arrived at and taken possession of the city of
Haidarabad, for His Majesty. But thanks to the power
of the fortune of ‘Alamgir, the enemy, inspite of their
countless number and incalculable wealth were struck with
such terror that during the advance of the imperial army,
no human being appeared either before the Emperor’s own
force or the army of Firuz Jang.

On Friday, the 28th January 1687/24th Rabi. A., the
Emperor ordered the enemy’s army which had assembled at
the foot of the fort [289] like swarms of ants and flies
around a carrion or on a lump of sugar, to be driven away.
The imperialists made great efforts, in carrying out the
command.» As they say, ‘‘The wind came and the gnats
fled’, the enemy fled, leaving their property, children and
families in the hands of the imperialists. Qalich Khan
galloped up to the fort and wanted to enter it immediately.
But God had willed it otherwise. * * * A zamburak ball hit
him on the shoulder-blade and save Lutfullah Khan who
had heroically accompanied him in this bold enterprise,
none advanced to aid him. So the Khan had to return on
horse-back from that terrible place of slaughter, and reached


--- Page 188 ---
1687 ] SIEGE OF GOLKONDA, DIFFICULTIES 177

his own camp (daira). By the Emperor’s command ‘Umdat-
‘ul-mulk went to visit him in his sickness. At that time the
surgeons were extracting the splinters of bones from his
shoulder-blade, and he was sitting composedly and talking
with the persons present without any contraction of the
muscles of his forehead, and was sipping coffee with the
other hand. He remarked, ‘“‘I have got an admirable
stitcher! ‘‘Although the surgeons and physicians, by
command, employed all sorts of remedies [290], he died
after three days. The Emperor bestowed robes and other
favours on Firuz Jang Bahadur and other sons of the
deceased and on Siadat Khan.

On Monday, the 7th February, 1687/4th Rabi. S.,
orders were issued for digging trenches. Although -guns,
muskets, and rockets were fired incessantly day and night
from the fort, which seemed as if made »f fire, the heroes
of the imperial army under the leadership of Saf Shikan
Khan recked not being burnt or slain, but carried the
trenches to the foot of the ditch in the space of one month.
This work, which usually takes years, was finished in a
twinkle of the eye. Heavy guns were mounted opposite
the fort, the pillars of which were demolished by the fire of
their guns, but success remained distant. Saf Shikan Khan,
having constructed a lofty gun-platform raised it up to the
height of the turret of the fort and mounted guns on it, yet
owing to his spite and enmity with Firuz Jang, he withdrew
his hand from the work and resigned. Salabat Khan
became Mir Atish vice him. [291] He too could not dis-
charge the duty as it should have been and resigned.
Sayyid Ghairat (‘Izzat) Khan succeeded him. At mid-
night owing to the neglect and self-will of the chiefs, the
enemy fell upon the raised battery, spoiled the gun, bound
and carried off (‘Izzat) Ghairat Khan, Sarbarah Khan (a
slave), and a party that had fallen into their hands. Saf
Shikan Khan was punished with removal from mansab and
imprisonment. Salabat Khan was again appointed Mir
Atish. Lutfullah Khan and the party of the khas chauki
and other eager soldiers were appointed to guard the raised
battery. The Khan stayed for three days in the middle of
the river which flows at the foot of the fort, when another
force arrived and expelled the enemy and firmly established
the battery. After two days Abul Hasan sent back ‘Izzat
Khan and others with robes. They came by the way of the
battery. But owing to the severity of the rains and this

23


--- Page 189 ---
178 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI [cH. 30

unseasonable delay, much of the battery was ruined.
Saf Shikan Khan guaranteed that in a short time he would
construct batteries up to the turret by the side of another
bastion ; he was released and did what he had promised.

At this time owing to excess of rain the river Manjera
raged in flood. No provision could come from the neigh-
bourhood. Famine prevailed; wheat, pulse and rice dis-
appeared. [292] Cries of grief at the disappearance of grain
rose from the famished on all sides of the camp. Of the
men of Haidarabad, not a soul remained alive; houses, river
and plain became filled with the dead. The same was the
condition of the camp. At night piles of the dead were
formed round the Emperor’s quarters. Daily sweepers
dragged them and flung them on the bank of the river from
sunrise to sunset. The same thing happened every day and
night. The survivors did not hesitate to eat the carrion of
men and animals. Kos after kos the eye fell only on mounds
of corpses. The incessant rain melted away the flesh and the
skin; otherwise the putrid air would have finished the
business of the survivors. After some months when the
rains ceased, the white ridges of bones looked from a
distance like hillocks of snow. Through the grace of God
to the survivors, the rains abated, the violence of the river
ceased, and provisions came from the surrounding country.
In the place of Sardar Khan, karori-ganj, Sayyid Sharif
Khan, son of Mir Sayyid Muhammad Qanauji, the spiritual
guide of Shah Jahan, and an honest, able and accomplished
man, was appointed. Thanks to the gracious aim of the
Emperor, the custodian of the livelihood of the people, the
scarcity was removed, and cheapness restored.

IMPRISONMENT OF PRINCE MUHAMMAD MU‘AZZAM

* * * [293] The Prince, in spite of his excellent under-
standing, reason and imagination, was so misled by his
bad companions and evil counsellors that the Emperor
apprehended from him mischief and disloyalty, which was
likely to cause affliction to the Prince himself and disgust
to the Emperor’s mind. For some time he overlooked the
Prince’s conduct, not wishing such a scandal to be made
public. But whep the Bijapur undertaking was thrown into
confusion, some men who used to convey secretly messages
to Sikandar in the fort, were captured and executed. On
Saturday, the 28th August 1686/18th Shawwal, others

of his disloyal servants viz., Mumin Khan darogha of
artillery, ‘Aziz Afghan, Multafat Khan the second bakhshi,
and Brindaban Purfan (the cunning) ‘were ordered to be
expelled from the camp. The lamp of wisdom and far-
sightedness had been extinguished in the Prince’s council
by all this darkness of evil fortune (i.e., evil counsellors).
And in conducting the war against Haidarabad, he was
overcome by the fraudulent seductions of the foolish Abul
Hasan. [294] Gradually the letters which’ used to be sent
into the fort of Golkonda through the medium of the secret-
writer of the trenches, fell into Firuz Jang’s hands. And
other signs of disloyalty bore witness to the truth of the
matter. One night the Khan went from his lodgings to the
Emperor and showed the letters, and convinced the Emperor
of the Prince’s self-will, and various acts cf disobedience and
disloyalty. The Emperor summoned Hayat Khan, younger
brother of Ihtamam Khan, who was the darogha of the
Prince’s diwan-i-khas, and said, ‘‘Carry this order to the
Prince, Shaikh Nizam Haidarabadi wants to make a night-
attack on the army to-night ; send your men to bar the way
of the enemy. As your men will go there, Ihtamam Khan
will remain round your tent (as a guard).’’ The necessary
order was issued to Ihtamam Khan. It was done. Next
day the Prince with his sons Muhammad Mu‘izzuddin and
Muhammad ‘Azim was brought to the Emperor, who was
sitting in the Hall of Audience. After the Prince had come
and sat down for some time, the Emperor said, ‘‘I have
spoken to Asad Khan and Bahramand Khan about certain
matters. Hold conference with them in the prayer-room.’’
The three princes went, willy nilly. They were stripped
of their arms, and detained there while a®ent was being
pitched (for them), and then they were taken to the tent.
_ The Emperor rose from the Court and went to the harem by
way of the deorhi of the khds parastar. Crying ‘‘alas!
alas !’’ he struck his hands on the two knees and continued
saying, ‘‘I have razed to the ground the work of forty
years!’’ [295] In short, through the exertions of Ihtamam
Khan guards were posted round (the Prince’s camp.) The
imperial clerks confiscated the goods and slaves of the
Prince’s household, in one twinkle of the eye, and as it were
carried a drop of water to the ocean. Ihtamam Khan was a
hazari; he now got the title of Sardar Khan and the
increment of 500. His son Hamiduddin, who was a 2-sadi,
received an increment of 2-sadi (50 tr.). ‘

In the course of a long period, mines were run by
Jamshid Khan, treasure (mal) was brought by ‘Abul Wahid
Khan; the Emperor went to the quarters of Firuz Jang
Khan ‘by way of the old raised battery; high officers were
appointed to make the assault; they worked hard all day.
Firuz Jang Khan Bahadur and Rustam Khan were wounded,
many of the bold fighters were slain at the end of the day.
Kam Bakhsh was sent with ‘Umdat-ul-mulk Asad Khan (as
reinforcement) ; the men could not advance one inch, owing
to the shower of musket bullets, rockets, chadar and huqqa
(bombs) without being slain or wounded. But still the
object was not gained. After spending the night in the
quarters of Firuz Jang, the Emperor returned to the camp
at early dawn without ceremony. Various other plans were
tried; immense wealth was spent. The godless atheists,
in greed of gain, co-operated with the enemy and played
their juggling tricks. Some avaricious traitors joined him
and after at first getting hopes from him, (at last) went
to hell through his deception. Some bv sending in grain
[296] caused their own perdition and met wrth the fate
of ungrateful persons. The siege was protracted. The
Emperor decided that a fort of wood and mud should be
built round the fort of Golkonda. In a short time it was
completed, and guards were placed at the gates, ingress and
egress being forbidden except on producing pass-ports. By
this time Firuz Jang Khan recovered from his wound and
had audience, receiving a robe, a zarah, a special jahalam,
and a jewelled mace. A robe was presented to the
wounded Rustam Khan; Bahram Khan, son of Mahabat
Khan deceased, was killed by a cannon-ball. A mourning
robe was given to his brother Farjam. Jan Nisar Khan’s
brother was slain, and for this reason favours were conferred
on the Khan. Shuja‘et Khan, brother of Saf Shikan Khan, ,
Mir Abul-mu‘ala, bakhshi of the army of Firuz Jang Khan,
Ekkataéz Khan, Suhrab Khan, Muhammad Hakim and
other wounded and scorched soldiers recovered through the
Emperor’s gifts.

On Saturday, the 28th May, 1687 /26th Rajab, Shaikh
Nizam, the best servant of Abul Hasan, who commanded
the force outside the fort-wall, came to interview the
Emperor, presented 500 mohars and 1,000 rupees, and
received the title of Muqarrab Khan, the rank of 6-hazari
(5,000 tr.) a special robe, a sword, a dagger with pearl ‘ilaqa,
a jewelled shield, a banner, kettledrums, 100,000 riipees in

cash, twenty Arab [297] ‘Iraqi, Turki and Cutchi horses,
and two elephants. Malik Munawwar, Shaikh Lad, Shaikh
‘Abdullah and his sons, and some of his relatives got high
titles, ranks,—none less than 4-hazdri,—robes, banners,
kettledrums, horses, and elephants.

Asuji Deccani, who was. Sambha’s qiladar of Salhir,
had audience, receiving a robe, a standard, a tugh, kettle-
drums, a horse, an elephant, and 20,000 rupees. Sarbuland
Khan brother of Sarfaraz Khan was given a standard, a
tugh, and kettledrums. Mankoji, Sambha’s qiladar of
Sangola had audience after the capture of this fort and
received a robe and the rank of 2-hazari (1000 tr.).

On Friday, the 20th May /18th Rajab, Muhammad ‘Ah
Khan, Khan-i-saman, died. He was noble-minded and
generous ; everybody who went to him had his wish fulfilled.
He had rectitude, piety, honesty, truthfulness, and sagacity.
Kamgar Khan got his post, and was succeeded by ‘Itiqad
Khan as darogha of the ghusalkhanah, near the Emperor’s
person, Iftikhar Khan, son of Sharif-ul-mulk Haidarabadi,
sister’s son of Abul Hasan, had audience, receiving a robe
and the rank of 3-hazari (1000 tr.). Sharif Khan, who was
appointed karori-ganj of the camp and collector of jazia for
the four subahs of the Deccan, was ordered to tour in the
subahs, in order to see that the jazia was collected according
to the rules of the Holy Law. [298] Mir ‘Abdul Karim,
in addition to his own duties, became deputy of the Khan,
in the post of karori-ganj. Sharif-ul-mulk died on Saturday,
the 25th June, 1687/24th Shaban. Robes were presented to
his sons.

CHAPTER XXXI.
31ST YEAR OF THE REIGN (1098 4.H.)

1st July, 1687—19th June, 1688.

* * PH Bi

On Thursday, the 7th July /7th Ramzan, the Emperor
rode out to inspect the trenches and the raised battery of
Saf Shikan Khan which had been carried in a short space
of time up to the height of the turret of the fort a second
time. For two hours the Emperor viewed the condition of
the fort on foot. Muhammad ‘Azam Shah, who had started
to punish the rebels of Hindustan before the Emperor set
out from Sholapur, and had reached Burhanpur, and
[299] Bakhshi-ul-mulk Ruhullah Khan, who had been
engaged in administering the disordered subah of Bijapur,
both reached the Presence by command on Sunday the
LOth July/10th Ramzan. The Prince was placed in
command of the operations against the fort.

CAPTURE, OF GOLKONDA FORT.

At midnight, on Wednesday, the 21st September /24th
Zil. Q., the Bakhshi-ul-mulk with a party of heroes in-
cluding Bahadur Khan, and others on the look-out for an
opportunity, was walking round the fort, when through the
treachery of Sarandaz Khan Batni Btjapuri, who had
deserted to the imperial service before the capture of
Bijapur, and afterwards joined Abul Hasan and become his
trusted officer, they entered the fort through a back door
(khirki) close to the old entrenchment. The Prince who
was staying at the river that flows at the foot of the fort
in order to support this corps, now reached the entrenchment
and struck up the music of victory. The Bakhshi-ul-mulk
reached the haveli of Abul Hasan, and in spite of the frantic
opposition of him and his companions, captured and brought
him away to the presence of the Prince. ‘Abdul Wali, son of
Shaikh ‘Abdus-samad J‘afar Khani, munshi of the [ 800 |
Emperor presented a quatrain embodying the date. * *
Out of his innate graciousness ‘Azam Shih refrained from

ordering this doomed man to be given the due meed of his
acts, but, with the Emperor’s permission brought him to
his (the Prince’s) own tent. At the end of the same day,
he took him to the Emperor’s quarters. That captive in
the prison of error, after being freed from the terror which
filled his heart, was lodged in a tent pitched for him,
he fell under the Emperor’s gracious indifference instead
of wrath, * * *

Thank God that*such a strong fort was captured in the
space of eight months and a few days. What a marvel that
after one year’s interval, in the same month two forts whose
fall had not been previously imagined as possible were
captured. Mir ‘Abdul Karim found out the date of this
wonderful conquest in the words ‘‘Conquest of the fort of
Golkonda, God bless it!’’ and was praised for it.

I shall now describe the strength of this fort, the charms
of this city, and the climate of this country. In former
times Golkonda [801] was called Mangal; its Raja was
named Dev Rai. After him it was captured by the
Bahmanis, After the fall of the Bahmani dynasty, the
fort was taken possession of by ‘Ali Naqi Qutbul-mulk,
a ghulam of Sultan Mahmud Bahmani, who was in
charge of it. The fort is situated on a hill, the summit
of which pierces the armour of the sky like the blade
of a sword. The celestials meet the terrestrials here.
None but ‘Alamgir ever conquered this fort. On no
side has it any ledge that might supply « handle for the
noose of the fancy of capturing it to raise itself. But it had
a hillock which might have helped a very great general to
attack it successfully. Before his accession to the throne
when Aurangzib invaded this country but afterwards gra-
ciotsly paradoned ‘Abdullah Qutb-ul-mulk, he, in the
thought that Aurangzib might return, built a strong fort
round this hillock and included it within the fort of
Golkonda, and thus gained security. * * *

The city of Haidarabad is situated two kos from the
fort of Golkonda; it was founded by Muhammad Quli
Qutb-ul-mulk, [802] who was infatuated by the courtezan
Bhagmati and named the city Bhagnagar after her. After-
wards it got its present name. Now that it has been
annexed to the Empire, turned into an additional subah of
the Deccan, it has been named Dar-ul-jihad Haidarabad. It
is a very pleasant place, delightful to the body and the mind.


--- Page 195 ---
184 MAASIR-1-‘ALAMG1R1 [cu. 31

The cultivated area is more extensive than fancy can
picture, the houses higher than one can imagine; the air
is so moist, the fountains so pure and flowing, and the
verdure so fresh that vou may think that the flowers and
herbs of the land have the colour of emerald and ruby. * * *

It would verily require another volume to describe in
detail the coming of the Haidarabadis to the imperial Court,
their gaining of mansabs from seven hazari to 5-sadi, and
the admission into the imperial service of prqfessional men,
men of skill, and artisans of every kind.

On Monday the 26th September/29th Zil. Q.,
Muhammad Kam Bakhsh was made subahdar of.Berar. He
had been a 10-hazdri (5,000 tr.), and now received an
increment of 5,000 tr. ‘Umdat-ul-mulk Asad Khan and
Firuz Khan each received an increment of a hazar tr. and
became a 7-hazart (same tr.). Mahabat Khan was promoted
by the addition of a hazar zat (1000 tr.). His grandson
[3803] Muhammad Mansur, newly come from Persia
(vilayet), had audience and received the title of Mukarramat
Khan and the rank of 14-hazari (1000 ti.). ‘Abdullah,
adopted son (khdnda) of Abul Hasan got the rank of
4-hazart (same tr.). Lutfullah Khan was a 2-hazari (1000 tr.)
and now got an increment of 200 troopers. Muhammad Yar
Khan got an increment of 5-sadi and became a 2-hazari
(800 tr.). Mir Muhammad Amin son of Mir Bahauddin,
brother’s son to Qalich Khan deceased, came to the imperial
Court after his father had been slain in Turan on the
suspicion of being in league with Anusha Khan, the king
of Urganj, who was at war with his own father-in-law ‘Abdul
‘Aziz Khan, king of Bukhara, afid was yraciously favoured
with the title of Khan and the rank of 2-hazdri (1,000 tr.).
Mukhlis Khan, son of Saf Shikan Khan, who was acting as
his father’s deputy in the daroghaship of artillery, got the
post for himself with an increment of 200 tr. making him
a hazari (800 tr.). ‘Inayetullah, mushrif of the jewellery
department, a 4-sadi (50 tr.), got an increment of 10 troopers.
Yar ‘Ali Beg, a 4-sadi (40 tr.) got an increment of 15
troopers. Shukrullah Khan, son-in-law of ‘Aqil Khan, was
appointed faujdar of the environs of Haidarabad vice Siddi
Yahya. [804] He was a 5-sadi (same tr.), and now got an
increment of a hazdér troopers. Mir ‘Abdul Karim was
appointed darogha of fines. Lutfullah Khan became darogha
of the servants of Muhammad Mu‘azzam, each of whom now
got a mansab, according to his position and rank, in the

Emperor’s establishment. The depressed Khidmat Khan
was appointed nazir vice Sardar Khan, who became darogha
of filkhanah vice Mu‘ataqgad Khan. Muhammad Matlab
became a Khan.

CONQUEST OF “THE LAND OF SAGAR.

When the Emperor’s mind was freed from the tasks
of occupying the spacious kingdom of Haidarabad, taking
possession of all its forts, sending administrators and
regulators on all sides and granting interviews-and posts to
the Haidarabadi officers, he sent a large army under
Khanahzad Khan, son of Ruhullah Khan, against the land
of Sagar. This country is situated between Bijapur and
Haidarabad; and Pam* Nayak of tribe of Dhedh is its
infamous ruler. Fortune likes to favour the mean and the
servile ; and so this utterly worthless infidel, lower than the
meanest of tribes in every generation from grandfather to
father, uplifted his [805] arrogant head in authority over
this country. By reason of his commanding 12,000 tr. and
one lakh of infantry and his possessing some strong forts,
especially the place of his residence, which was one of the
famous strongholds of the time, he held up his head as the
equal of the kings of Bijapur and Haidarabad. None could
extirpate him. Nay more, Muslims adoring him as a leader
considered him as their mediator and defender in evil days,
so that at the siege of Bijapur he had the audacity to send
6,000 fighting footmen, with provisions carried on the head,
who were slain by Firuz Jang, as has been already narrated.
And also at the siege of Golkonda he had repeatedly aided
the Haidarabadis and thereby made his own downfall sure.

Khanahzad Khan was instructed that if this misguided
man agreed to visit the Emperor he should not take steps
to desolate his country or slay and imprison his subjects,
otherwise he should serve him right. The Khan hastened
to the country and wakened him from the sleep of pride, by
sending the imperial order to him. As the people of his
country were not destined for ruin, nor were his wealth and
household effects doomed to destruction, in spite of his not

* The text writes the name variously on different pages—Padam, p. 239,
Pid, pp. 264, 304 and 305. The correct name is Pam (vide my History of
Aurangzib, Vol. V, Ch. 56, § 2),

believing in a Day of Judgment, he on receiving the
imperial message and anticipating a vast army, sent word
to say that he would surrender his kingdom to the King of
Kings and submit to the Emperor. And so his effects were
saved from destruction [806], and none of his men was
killed. According to the Emperor’s instructions, the Khan
guarded his family and did not permit a blade of grass to be
destroyed. He came out of the fort and met the Khan; and
on Monday, the 28th November, 1687/2nd Safar, the fort
bowed to the Muslim leaders. In a place where since the
far-off foundation of the world none had been able to utter
the cry of prayer (namaz), the Musalmani drum was so
loudly beaten that it deafened the ears of false believers.
The cry ‘‘Islam is true, infidelity is false’’ rolled up to the
dome of the sky, and strengthened the spirits of the
Islamites. The Khan after appointing a defender of the
fort and regulating and taking possession of the neighbour-
hood, came to the Court with the Nayak, and was properly
rewarded. His father had served well at the siege of
Golkonda, and now the son, too, showed no less ability in
capturing Sagar. Pam Nayak was a strange creature, of
an uncouth shape. * * * [Verses] :

Night has gone into mourning at being taken for
his emblem.

The day has turned into night on account of the bulk
of this black cloud.

Bears and pigs would have felt deeply disgraced if
likened to him. *

ven the washer of the dead was disgusted at the
sight of him.

[3807] I do not know how in the dark recess of his heart
this light flashed that he should acquire the fortune of
seeing the Emperor. On Tuesday, the 27th December,
1687 /2nd Rabi. A., the Emperor granted him an interview
and honoured him by giving him a place to stand far above
his condition. After attending the Court for five or six days
he suddenly set off to visit hell. Verse :—

“It is better that such a bad-liver should be dead.”’
His sons and relatives were given proper mansabs. His
Majesty ordered the country of Sagar to be called
Nasratabad, The land is delightful, fresh, and fertile, * * *

1688 | RETURN AFTER CAPTURE OF GOLKONDA 187

THE EMPEROR’S RETURN FROM HAIDARABAD TO BIJAPUR

As the only work agrecable to the Emperor was to
regulate the world and train mankind, and he never desired
to seek bodily repose from this task of conquering countries,
therefore, inspite of the agreeableness of the climate of
Haidarabad, [808] he decided to march to those cities his
stay at which would lead to the most s satisfactory conclusion
of the affairs of the empire, especially to inflict proper
punishment on the militant and unclean infidel Sambha,
who had formed a protective alliance with those two lost
travellers in the wrong path, namely Sikandar and Abul
Hasan, and who by the assertion of this false claim left
these two rulers in the enjoyment of no trust or respect of
the public.

On Wednesday, the 25th January, 1688/1st Rabi. S.,
the Emperor started for Bijapur. At an auspicious hour
Khan Bahadur Firuz Jang was appointed to capture the fort
of Adoni from Mas‘aud Habshi, a slave (ghulam) of the
father of Sikandar, who during the confusion in the
government of this dynasty became the supreme head of
affairs, and ungratefully left to his master’s son nothing
save the name of king and carried off and stored in that
strong fort the chief treasures, buried hoards, choice
articles, and precious jewels. 25,000 tr. were appointed to
accompany the Khan Bahadur. Muhammad ‘Azam, after
being variously favoured, was sent to extirpate Sambha;
40, 000 experienced tr. followed him. On Tuesday, the
7th February /14th Rabi. S., the Emperor reached [309 |
Zafarabad Bidar, and lodged on the bank of the tank of
Kamthanah. Here Abul Hasan, who had never during
his fifteen vears of reign travelled farther than from the
city of Haidarabad to Muhammadnagar, one kos distant,
and to whom this daily riding (with the Emperor) was very
painful, begged permission to take to a life of retirement.
The Emperor ordered Jan-sipir Khan to convey him to
Daulatabad, and the officers to get ready for him such
articles of bed and board as are indispensable to pampered
worldlings of weak faith. Fifty thousand rupees a year was
fixed for his needs. What marvellous kindness was it on
the part of His Majesty to nurse such a felon in the cradle
of ease and comfort and pardon his sins!

It would be no exaggeration to call that tank the Tigris.
Whosoever sits on the embankment on its northern side,

gives repose to his own life. Nowhere are the air and water
better than here. The sown fields about this blessed water
are green; the cultivators are not beholden to the rain-
clouds. They scatter the seeds one year, and reap the har-
vest for some years after. Here the great saint Khwaja
Muhammad Y‘aqub Joibari left the caravanserai of life.
The Emperor [310] had great kindness for the deceased.
He conferred favours on his relatives and sent his corpse to
his ‘home’ to be buried in the vault of his forefathers.

After three days’ halt here the army again marched.
On Saturday, the 25th February/8rd Jamad. A., the
Emperor reached the outskirts of Gulbarga, and made a
pilgrimage to the tomb of Mir Sayyid Muhammad Gisuda-
raz, removing the veil of poverty from the heads of the
residents of that blessed place. After seven days’ halt the
army resumed the march towards Bijapur. On Thursday,
the 15th March, 1688/22nd Jamad. A., the Emperor
reached that city. All kinds of inhabitants, faqirs, and
hermits, who had fallen into want through the ruin of the
city and its environs, were relieved by the Emperor’s
charity. * * * [311]

CHAPTER XXXII
32ND YEAR OF THE REIGN:

20th June, 1688—s8th June, 1689

Bo % Ba ay

I have no space to mention the numberless strong forts
which were conquered by the imperial officers during this
time. As the conclusion of the affair of the rebel Rajaram
Jat under the command of Muhammad Bidar Bakht and the
supervision of Khan Jahan Bahadur Zafar Jang and other
heroes, was a grand event, and as great feats were per-
formed, much activity displayed and large sums spent in it,
I ought to narrate a little of it. On Saturday, the 11th
August /8rd Shawwal, the Emperor learnt from the news-
writers of this army that the infernal doy had gone to hell
through a gun-shot, on Wednesday the 4th July/15th
Ramzan; the neighbourhood had been cleared of the rebel
infidels, and vast multitudes of people were praising and
blessing the Emperor for giving them peace. [812] On the
5th September, 1688/19th Zil. Q., the rebel’s head was
brought to the Emperor.

Kamgar Khan was married to the daughter of Sayyid
Muzaffar Haidarabadi, and received from the Emperor a
robe, a horse, and a sahra worth 10,000 rupees. I‘timad
Khan, brother’s son of ‘Alaé-ul-mulk Fazil Khan received
the post of Khan-i-saman of the Emperor’s household vice
Kamegar Khan, and an increment of 500 zat (100 tr.) making
him a 2-hazari (400 tr.), a Ralgi and ‘asa of jasper. Mirza
Mu‘izz got the title of Musavi Khan and the post of daftar-
dar-i-tan vice him. Khwaja ‘Abdur Rahim Khan became
bayutat vice Muhasan Khan, Mu‘atamad Khan succeeded
him as darogha of dagh and tashiha. I‘tiqad Khan on the
death of his wife (the daughter of Amir-ul-umara Shaista
Khan) received a special robe and a dagger. Abul Hasan
Haidarabadi had three daughters : by the imperial command
the first was married to Sikandar Bijapuri, the second to
Muhammad ‘Umar son of Shaikh Muhammad Nagqshband
of Sirhind, the third, to ‘Umdat-ul-mulk Asad Khan’s [313]
son ‘Inayet Khan who received a robe, a horse, an elephant,


--- Page 201 ---
190 MAASIR-I-‘ ALAMGIRI [cH. 82

and a sahra. Mukhlis Khan, Mir Atish, was sent to bring
the water of the river Krishna to the city of Bijapur, by an
aqueduct and was presented with a dagger.

Fazl ‘Ali, son of that Murshid Quli Khan who was a
servant of the days of prince-hood, became a Khan and news-
writer of the kachari of the High Diwan. When conferring
the title the Emperor said ‘‘Ask him if he wants to have
‘Khan’ added to his name or his father’s title.’’ The man
for certain reasons (of his own) chose the title of Faz] ‘Ali
Khan. The Emperor said ‘‘My parents and I are the sacri-
fice of ‘Ali (Qurban-i-‘Ali). Tell this fool, ‘Ali is gone, you
will be Quli’. Faz] Quli Khan is better.’? I remember other
remarks of His Majesty suited to this subject. A courtier
of Indian origin made suit that two house-hold slaves had
finished memorizing the Quran and hoped to be permitted to
recite it to His Majesty. The Emperor ordered them to be
brought to him at night. When they appeared and the
courtier said ‘‘The sons of so and so ire present,’’ His
Majesty remarked, ‘‘Don’t utter the name of a heretic
(Shi‘a).’? The courtier was surprised and said, ‘‘I was
speaking of so and so.’’ The Emperor replied, ‘‘Well, if
you don’t believe me, ask the names of both.’’ He went
out, asked, and reported, ‘‘They are called Hasan ‘Ali and
Husain ‘Ali.’’ The Emperor retorted ‘‘My parents and I
are the sacrifice of ‘Ali. What connection have Hindustanis
with this name? Through evil desires they are afflicted with
friendship for the heretical Shi‘as, leave the right path and
go astray. May God awaken us from the drowsiness of the
negligent!” [314]

Mihrunnisa Begam received permission to go to Delhi.
Lutfullah Khan was ordered to escort her. Sardar
Khan darogha of fil-khanah, on getting a robe and an
increment of 100 tr., became a 1%-hazari (500 tr.). Sayyid
Abu S‘aid, the dismissed qazi of the camp, died. Mourning
robes were presented to his sons Nizamuddin and Faiyaz-
ud-din. * * Saf Shikan Khan became darogha of ‘arz-i-
mukarrar vice Siadat Khan. Prince Daulat-afza died, and
by command was buried in the tomb of ‘Ali ‘Adil Khan
Bijapuri. ‘Inayetullah, mushrif of the jewellery-depart-
ment, became Khan-i-saman of the household of Zinat-un-
nisa Begam. Lashkar Khan, son of Khan Jahan Shah-
jahani, who had the title of Munawwar Khan was appointed
defender of Bijapur. Hamiduddin Khan son of Sardar

1688] SIDDI MASAUD OF ADONI 191

Khan, became darogha of fil-khanah vice his father ; he was
a 5-sadi, and now received an increment of 100 troopers.

I shall now write about the victories of Prince ‘Azam
Shah and Firuz Jang. The Prince after taking leave of the
Emperor for punishing Sambha turned [315] his attention
to the conquest of the fort of Belgaum which was one of the
strong forts belonging to Bijapur. In a short time he put
the garrison to hard straits by running trenches and bom-
bardment. Those foolish men had set up as their chief a
boy, whose father had been governor on behalf of Bijapur
but had died a short time before this. When they found
their efforts unavailing, and the imperialists firmly deter-
mined, they capitulated, and the fort with its dependencies
was conquered and named ‘Azam-nagar.* Through the
kind mediation of the Prince, the boy made his bow at Court
and received a suitable mansab. The Prince returned to
Court as it was the season for going into quarters (chiaunt).
Firuz Jang Bahadur who had been engaged in besieging the
fort of Adoni, first invited the [Adilshahi] slave Mas‘aud
to visit the Emperor, but at last on seeing that the old fool
chose the wrong path, he plundered and occupied the pros-
perous districts of the country, burnt the wadi, slew the
men who had boldly come out of the fort, ran trenches,
fired guns and muskets, and so pressed the besieged hard.
{816] At last he came out of the fort with all humility,
stating his demands, on the 6th August, 1688/8th Shawwal.
The fort was renamed Imtidzgarh.

When Khan Firuz Jang’s despatch announcing the
conquest arrived, the bearer and Siadat Khan were rewarded
with robes; the band played joyous notes; the courtiers
made their bow of invoking blessings. The Emperor in his
infinite mercy gave the wretch Mas‘aud the title of Khan
the rank of 7-hazari (same tr.) and the faujdari and jagirdari
of Moradabad, and ordered that he should accompany the
army of Firuz Jang Khan till he left the Deccan. His sons
and relatives were highly favoured. Firuz Jang Khan after
taking possession of the materials in the fort and the
regulation and occupation of the neighbourhood, reached the
court on Monday, the 19th November /5th Safar, and was
rewarded for his excellent services. [3817] ‘Itimad Khan,
Khian-i-saman, got the title of Fazil Khan and Mir Husain,
son of Amanat Khan got his father’s title.

THE GREAT PLAGUE—-MARCH OF THE EMPEROR FROM BIJAPUR
TO THE COUNTRY OF SAMBHA

Khan Firuz Jang, on his return from the capture of
Imtiazgarh, stayed at Court for a few days and was then
sent to extirpate the infidel. The Emperor resolved to
march in aid of the Prince. Friday, the 14th December /
Ist Rabi. A., was chosen as the day for starting, and porters
who had gone to distant parganahs were summoned back
to the Court.

In the middle of the month of Muharram (16th October
—14th November, 1688) a terrible plague broke out and
carried off men. The health of the people became impaired
and ruined, by declining from their normal condition.
Joyous practices ceased. All sat down in mourning. Death
wanted to remove the seed of human kind altogether from the
world. I cannot say that the great Day of Judgment had
come; but this was a day of doom at the power of which
great and small alike lost their lives. * * * [318]

A bubo appeared in the armpit or the corner of the thigh;
high fever and unconsciousness raged; the treatment of
physicians produced no effect. Few men lived through two
days; but most died within two or three days. Even those
who lived and had lost no dependant, on seeing the prevailing
state of things, considered themselves as dead. How fine
would it have been if this thought had remained in the mind
in times of prosperity! In short, none looked after any-
body else ; everywhere the cry rose ‘‘My own self! my own
self !’? The half-dead people abstained from all worldly
works and affairs and lay in expectation of death every hour.
Among the victims were, the Emperor’s parastar, the old
and devoted hand-maid, Aurangabadi-Mahal, Muhammadi
Raj, the son of Maharaja Jaswant Singh, who had been
brought up in the imperial harem and attained to the age of
thirteen years and a high mansab, Fazil Khan Sadr, and
many other grandees. The middle class men and the
common people, Muslims and infidels, who died cannot be
numbered, but are conjectured to have been not less than a
lakh. Many were afflicted by disorder of the brain or lost
the use of their eyes, tongues and ears. Among the highest,
Firuz Jang Bahadur received injury in his eyes. Who spoke
or heard anything of the plight of the common people?
Historians have not recorded any such havoc in any former

age. The oldest man living has not seen or heard of such
an epidemic, which lasted for two months. * * * [319]

In the midst of such a destruction the Emperor, relying
on the help of God, came out of Bijapur on the above-men-
tioned date with strength of heart and firmness of purpose.
Praised be God that after one week of violence the epidemic
began to abate. Through the grace of God, the Emperor
marched to Akluj. As according to the physicians the eye
of Firuz Jang Khan was not likely to be healed soon, the
Prince alone was sent off with the army to the country of
the enemy [Sambha ].

CAPTURE AND EXECUTION OF SAMBHA :
* * * * .

While the Emperor [820] was staying at the aforesaid
place for transacting certain affairs, the ears of the world
were gladdened by a happy news from the invisible world.
The merry music of victory, which the’ears of the Muslims
had been expecting, resounded through the sky. Peace and
safety were restored through the blessings of the justice
and virtues of the Emperor. Disturbance sank down. Satan
was chained. To speak more plainly, through the power
of the Emperor’s fortune, the infernal infidel Sambha was
made prisoner by the army.

Shaikh Nizim Haidarabadi, surnamed Mugarrab
Khan, .a brave general who with his sons and relatives
enjoyed among themselves the-ranks of 25-hazari (21,000
tr.) in recognition of his military capacity, had been
appointed from Bijapur before this to capture fort Parnala,
which was in the enemy’s possession. Like a prudent and
watchful man, he had sent spies to bring in news of the
infidel. Suddenly they brought to him the true news that
Sambha, on account of his feud with the family of the
Shirkés, who were connected with him by kinship, had gone
from Riairi to fort Khelna, and after making a settlement
with that family, and gaining composure of mind about
provisioning this fort, he had gone to Sangameswar [821]
‘where his minister Kavi-kalas had constructed gardens and
lofty buildings, and was there engaged in merriment and
pleasure. Attended by a party of honour-seeking devoted
followers, the Khan out of devotion to the Emperor, in utter
disregard of his life started from Kolhapur, from which the

above place was forty-five kos distant, and the path full of
hill-tops and passes so difficult and dangerous that travellers
have not seen the like of them on earth. He made forced
marches. Although the spies of Sambha informed him that
-the Mughal army was coming, that man intoxicated with
the wine of folly and pride had them beheaded by giving the
signal of a frown and saying, ‘‘You heedless men, you are
mad- Can a Mughal force arrive here?’’ The Khan after
patiently enduring much fatigue, suddenly came upon
Sambha with the speed of lightning or the wind; that cursed
wretch charged him with the support of four or five thousand
Deccani spearmen; Kavi-kalas was accidentally hit by an
arrow and fled. After a little fight Sambha concealed him-
self in a hole in the mansion of Kavi-kalas in the hope that
none had noticed him. Spies gave correct information to
the Khan as to his hiding-place. The Khan without pur-
suing the fugitives, surrounded the haveli. His son“Ikhlas
Khan entered by the steps with a company of heroes and
dragged that low fellow and Kavi-kalas by the hair to the
elephant ridden by the Khan. [322]

* * * #

Twenty-five of his chief followers with their wives and
daughters were made prisoners. This news reached the
Emperor at Akluj, which was henceforth named ds‘ad-
nagar. He ordered Hamiduddin Khan, son of Sardar Khan,
the provost-marshal (shahna) of the camp, to hasten to
Mugarrab Khan and bring the captive chained and
manacled. The victorious Khan came out of the country
(in safety) by prudent management, and through the good
luck of ‘Alamgir none of the infidel chiefs made any effort
(to rescue the prisoner). On Friday, the 15th February,
1689/5th Jamad. A., when the imperial army after march-
ing from As‘adnagar had encamped at Bahadurgarh,
Sambha was brought to the court. The Emperor out of his
devotion to Islam ordered that from two kos before the camp
the disgraced and unlucky Sambha should be made to wear
a wooden cap* (the badge of a condemned criminal) and his
comrades should be clad in the dress of buffoons, punished
in various ways, mounted on camels, and brought to the

* Kulah-i-Zaugula--a ridiculously shaped cap, from which are suspended
many little bells and foxes’ tails, and in which any person detected in selling

encampment and the darbar with drums beating and
trumpets pealing,—so that the Muslims might be heartened
and the infidels disheartened by seeing it. The night pre-
ceding the morning on which he was brought to the Court,
was without exaggeration the shab-i-barat because nobody
slept till morning for the pleasure of seeing the spectacle ;
and the day was like the day of ‘Id because all men old and
young went out to see such a scene of joy and happiness. In
short, this man, who deserved a degrading parade and execu-
tion, was taken round the whole camp, and then [823]
brought to the Emperor, who was sitting in the Hall of
Public Audience. He ordered him to be removed to the
prison of retribution. That very moment the Emperor
descended from the throne, and kneeling on the carpet of
prayer bowed his head to the ground in thanking God and
raised his hands in prayer to the Judge of Actions and
Promoter of Hopes. The cloud of the Manifestation of the
handiwork of Providence was dissolved and drops of Marvel
(at God’s power) fell from his far-sighted eyes. (Verse)

The peak of his cap is in high heaven, [and yet]
His head is ever bowed down to the earth in reverence.

, As Sambha had previously ignored the value of
imperial mercy, and fled first from the Emperor’s court in
the company of his father, and the second time from the late
Dilir Khan, therefore that very night his eves were deprived
of the power of seeing, and the next day the tongue of the
deceitful speaker Kavi-kalas (was cut out). * * * [324]

Where was Sambha in his heaven-facing stronghold of
Rairi! and where was his present disgrace and captivity in
retribution for his ingratitude! Of the various verses
embodying the date composed bv rhetoricians, that of
‘Inayetullah, the agent of ‘Azam Shah, viz.,

‘‘Sambha became a prisoner with wife and son’’, [best ]
expresses the event, and it was accepted by all. His captor
was rewarded for this splendid service with the title of
Khan-i-Zaman Fath Jang, a reward of 50,000 rupees, a
special and resplendent robe, a horse with jewelled saddle
and sdz,a dagger, a dhup, with jewelled purdalah, and
promotion raising him to the rank of 7-hazdri (same tr.).
Of his sons, Ikhlas Khan got the title of Khan-i-‘Alam, a
robe, and promotion making him a 5-hazari (same tr.),
Shaikh Miran the title of Munawwar Khan and Shaikh


--- Page 207 ---
196. MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI [cH. 82

‘Abdullah that of Ikhtisis Khan. Ihtaram Khan and other
relatives and companions of the Khan each got a robe and a
mansab. In consideration of the harshness and insult that
he had practised by slaying and imprisoning Muslims and
plundering the cities of Islam, the destruction of this wicked
infidel preponderated over the reasons for keeping him aliye,
[325] and the decision of the masters of the Holy Law and
Faith and the counsel of the dignitaries of the Church and
State were in favour of despatching this hellish robber.
Therefore, after the arrival of the Emperor at Koregaon
on Sunday the 3rd March /21st Jamad. A., he was executed
along with Kavi-kalas with the sword on Monday, the 11th
March, 1689/29th Jamad. A.

I shall finish the account of this matter by narrating an
event which was the preface to the Emperor’s success. Be-
fore this, when the capture of Sambha never came on the
tongues of the people and was regarded as an impossibility,
Sayyid Fath Muhammad, one of the sons of Mir Sayyid
Muhammad Gisudaraz, who after spending his long life
in the military profession had taken to retirement in his
home at Ahsanabad Gulbarga, and whose son Sayyid Badi‘-
ullah (whose forehead indicated his asceticism and goodness
and fitness to be the successor of a saint) had been appointed
successor at the saint’s own tomb by the Emperor on account
of his devotion to the saints of olden times and kindness to the
members of this family, and who had been granted the
sairghul (rent-free land) of some fertile villages, besides
[826] lavish ina‘ms,—came to the camp, interviewed the
Emperor who loved hermits, and narrated, ‘‘I have often sat
in prayer face to face with the illuminated tomb, with a view
to [fore-] seeing the end of this infidel’s career. One night I
dreamt that I was travelling in order to visit holy places, and
was passing over a hill difficult to traverse. A party was
setting up poles. They asked me ‘‘Where are you going ?”’
I made my wish known. They said ‘‘A hog has established
himself in this hill for a long time past. You, too, should
exert yourself with us to catch him.’’ After dawn it struck
me that I should soon come to the army, and take part in
this holy war till the completion of the affair of the wicked
infidel.’’ The Emperor was greatly delighted to hear these
words, and showed respect to and conferred favours on the
Sayyid. In less than ten days the wish of the’ people was
gratified. The very day that the news of Sambha’s capture
reached the Emperor he summoned the Sayyid and after

giving him good wishes and pecuniary aid permitted him to
depart. By way of showing gratitude for this wonderful
victory, ten thousand rupees were sent to the blessed tomb
for the poor and the attendants.

On Tuesday, the 2nd April/2lst Jamad.S., the
Emperor left Koregaon to see the fort of Islamabad or
Chakna. Prince Muhammad ‘Azam, who was encamped
five kos in front of it, came there and had interview. That
day after bidding farewell to the Prince [827] His Majesty
returned to his mansion. :

One of the events of this auspicious year was the
capture of the chiefs who had accompanied Rama [Rajaram]
in his adversity. This infidel, the younger brother of
Sambha, had been kept in prison by the latter. After
Sambhi’s death he became chief and gained some authority
in Rairi. Before the capture of Rairi, while Zulfiqar
Khan was pressing the besieged very hard, he disguised
himself as a yogi and fled from the fort. (Verses)

Behold this coward, who will never
See the face of good fortune.

He sought his own personal ease,
He left his wife and son. in distress.

When this news was confirmed by the letters of spies,
the Emperor issued orders to ‘Abdullah Khan Barha,—who
after he had acted for some time as the deputy of Bakhshi-
ul-mulk Ruhullah Khan when the latter was summoned to
Haidarabad, and had become himself Subahdar of Bijapur,
and had then by the Emperor’s command gone to capture
two strong forts in the dependencies of Bijapur,—now to
capture Rama if he wandered on that side. Spies brought
to him the true news that Rama [Rajaram] lay concealed
for some time, but had now gathered about 300 followers
of the rank of chiefs, [828] and after passing within a few
kos of that place had entered within the frontiers of the Rani
of Bidnur. The Khan deferring to another time the
capture of the forts, first sent his eldest son Hasan ‘Ali
quickly,in that direction, and himself making forced marches
for three days and nights reached the enemy at night within
the border of the zamindari of this she-bear, near the fort
of Subhangarh and Jara, belonging to her and situated on
the bank of the Tungabhadra, in the island of which the


--- Page 209 ---
198 MAASIR-1-'ALAMGIRi (cx. 82

enemy had taken refuge. He reddened his sword in their
blood. Many died and went to hell. Other men, more than
a hundred, including chiefs like Hindu Rao, and Vyankoji,
the brother of Santa, and Baharji and Mania Ghorparé,*
were taken prisoners. In the midst of this tumult of
lamentation, Rama [Rajaram], leaving his turban, coat
and shoes, not to speak of his weapons behind, fled in such
a manner that nobody got information of it. Although the
Khan had performed such a grand feat, yet his ill-luck
made him show negligence in the affair of the escape of
Rama. And the she-bear too was suspected of having
concealed Rama and afterwards let him go. At the first
news that Rama had been captured, the Emperor ordered
Hamiduddin Khan to bring him to Court. On the arrival
of the second news, he ordered the prisoners to be confined
in the citadel of Bijapur. Jan Nisar Khan was appointed
with a large party [829] to invade the zamindari of the
she-bear. The Satanic Santa at this time triumphantly
resisted the Khan, Matlab Khan and Sharza Khan. At last
the affair of the Rani ended in her paying a small money-
tribute under the name of fine. As he (Santa) was destined
to live some time more, he escaped being caught by the
imperialists. It was a wonder that Hindu Rao, Baharji and
some others of the prisoners escaped from this strong prison,
—escape from which is incredible except in concert with the
guards. On the matter being reported to the Emperor the
remaining eighty prisoners were executed. Jashkar,Khan
became nazim vice ‘Abdullah Khan. His son Wajih-ud-din
the qiladar of the citadel and Faujdar Khan the kotw4l were
punished by diminution of mansab.

*The MS. reads—Hindu Rio, Yekoji the brother of Santa, Baharji, and
Mania Ghorparé.

Bahramand Khan chose a neat place on the bank of the
Krishna for the imperial quarters. The Emperor liked it,
and presented the Khan with a diamond ring. Here His
Majesty stayed for two months.

One day while the Emperor was holding the high Court
of Justice, Salabat Khan, the first Mir Tuzuk, presented a
man who said, ‘‘I have come from the far-off land of Bengal
to become your majesty’s disciple. I hope that I may gain
my desire.’?’ The Emperor smiled, took out of his pocket
and gave the Khan about 100 rupees and bits (churn) of
gold and silver to be presented to the man and said, ‘“Tell
him that the favour he expects from me is this!’’ The
Khan gave him the money, but he flung it away and [834].
jumped into the river. The Khan raised a cry lest he should
be drowned. By command some people swam and rescued
him from the river. His Majesty turning his face towards
his inner circle, said to Sardar Khan, ‘‘A man has come
from Bengal with the silly notion of becoming my disciple.
(Hindi verses)*

Tupi lende bawri dende, gahare nilaj,
Chuha khadan mawli tu kal bandhe chhaj!

‘‘Take him to Mian Muhammad Naf’i Sirhindi and
request him to admit him as a disciple and to lay the cap
of Sirhind on his head.’’ God be my witness that there is
(not) in this age any Shaikh or faqir except this Emperor,
who reveals the ascetic behind the veil of the king and exalts
asceticism by this type of kingship, who has reached such
a degree of holiness as to train a disciple and lead him
up to the rank (of a perfect hermit). But in spite of his
possessing power that stretches up to the heavens, his nature
is marked by humility, and in spite of his possessing riches
and the materials of pomp, he is a man of prayer. (Verse)

I am the servant of that king of kings under
whose sovereignty

Are combined the externals of the lord and
the soul of the ascetic.

“I offer the following forced interpretation of this couplet. for what it
may be worth: “O deeply shameless man! You talk of putting on a peaked
cap and digging a large well with steps (bdori); rats are eating away the
foundations [of your house] while you propose to construct its gallery
to-morrow !’’ For lende read lenge, for dende read denge, for gahar gahard,

RELEASE. OF PRINCE MUHAMMAD MU‘AZZAM FROM CAPTIVITY

At the beginning of the Emperor’s displeasure, the
Prince and his sons were not allowed even to cut the hair
of their heads. Six months passed in this way. Khidmat
Khan nazir who had been naib of Shah Jahan, and could
speak boldly in consideration of his old services, urged this
matter before the Emperor beyond limit. At that time the
Emperor only ordered the Prince to be reformed [by
punishment.|] After a time, when the violence of his
anger gradually abated, and the natural kindness of His
Majesty returned, transcripts of Quranic prayers were
repeatedly entrusted to Sardar Khan, muhafiz, with the
order ‘‘Convey these to this second Joseph and captive Jonah
and tell him to be engaged in reciting them, so that the
kindness of God may incline my heart to release [3842] him,
and cause him to be freed from the pain of separation from
me.’’ A fine idea was contained in this rare expression,
so that the aforesaid Khan submitted to the Emperor, ‘‘It
is in your Majesty’s discretion to release him.’’ The
Emperor replied, ‘‘Yes, but the King of kings—supreme
is His wisdom—has made me ruler of the habitable globe;
so that wherever oppression is practised by anybody on
another, the victim may hope that he will complain to me
and will thus secure justice. Owing to certain earthly, con-
siderations, I have inflicted hardship upon him. But the
time has not yet come for releasing him. He has no asylum
except the Court of God. Then, he ought to be kept in
hope that he may not despair of me and ccmplain to God;
for, if he complains to God where shall I have refuge ?’’ As
it was destined that this Prince would one day become
sovereign, the Emperor’s heart was inclined to this that
the Prince would come out of his sufferings and troubles
into the sunshine of royal favour. He began to give gradual
and systematic relief to the Prince, with every caution
and care so that even a fly might not trouble this soul-sick
patient. * * * *

On the day when His Majesty marched away from
Badri, he ordered the said muhafiz, [843] that whenever
the Emperor would ride away from his halting-place, the
imperial tent should be kept standing with its carpets and
decorations uncharged, and the Prince be brought from his
quarters to it, shown all the places and made to sit every-
where for some time, so that all his senses and limbs might

acquire a proper change of relish from the delight and
exhilaration. It was done. The Prince said to the muhafiz,
“T ought to have an interview. How can the thirst for an
interview be slaked by a mere view of the house?’’ This
went on till the news of the death of the Prince’s mother
Nawwab Bai came from Delhi. Pavilions were spread from
the courtyard of the Private Audience Hall to the Prince’s
quarters, and a screened lane formed, and the Emperor
with Zinat-un-nisa Begam visited the Prince and condoled
with him. After this, on Monday, the 20th July, 1691/
4th Zil.Q., the Prince was granted an interview. He was
ordered to perform the zuhar namaéz in company of the
Emperor and to come and perform the Friday prayer in the
mosque of the palace (Bijapur), whenever the Emperor went
to the Jam‘a mosque to say his Friday prayer. And simi-
larly, the Prince sometimes came by command to the baths
situated in the fort for washing and purifying his body, and
sometimes in order to enjoy delights he visited the garden
and tank of Shahabad, founded by the Emperor. In short,
the veil was gradually removed.

Khwaja Daulat Mahalli (eunuch) was ordered to bring
the Prince’s family from Delhi to the court. [344]
Muhammad Mu‘izzuddin and Muhammad ‘Azim each
received the rank of 9-hazari (2000 tr.), Muhammad Raf‘i-
ul-qadr that of 7-hazari (1000 tr.), and Muhammad Khujista
Akhtar received a robe. They made their bows for
these favours in the Hall of Public Audience. Hamiduddin
Khan received an elephant and a robe. On Monday, the
20th July, 1691, Bakhshi-ul-mulk Ruhullah Khan was sent
towards Nasratabad Sakkhar, his followers being rewarded.
Tahawwar Khan, son of Salabat Khan, became sazawal of
the army of Kam Bakhsh; he was a 8-sadi (300 tr.), and
now received an increment of 100 (50 tr.). Lwutfullah
Khan after dismissal, was reinstated. Saf Shikan Khan
brought to the Court the harem ladies and dependants of
Muhammad Mu‘azzam who had arrived from Delhi at
Aurangabad. News came that on Sunday, the 4th October /
21st Muharram, ‘Umdat-ul-mulk Asam Khan had inter-
viewed Kam Bakhsh at Kadapa, and that the two had reached
Jinji, on Wednesday, the 16th December, 1691 /5th Rabi.S.

On Friday, the 18th December/7th Rabi.S., a mad
pauper unsheathed a sword in the Jam‘a mosque and ran
towards the Emperor. The bodyguard captured him. He
was made over to SaJabat Khan, On Thursday, the 24th

to hunt, Muhammad ‘Azam and Bidar Bakht interviewed
him, and accompanied him during the whole journey [345]
and on the spot received their leave to set out for Nasratabad

by command from Kam Bakhsh’s army to the Court, had
his interview on Thursday, the 3lst December, 1691 /20th

A., Zulfiqar Khan Bahadur was rewarded for the capture
of fort Trinomali by being promoted to the rank of 4-hazari

Mu‘izzuddin, and Muhammad Karim and Farrukh Siyar,
sons of Muhammad ‘Azim, had audience, receiving increase
of their daily stipend, favours, robes and jewels.

On Tuesday, the 8rd May /26th Shaban, the Emperor
started from Bijapur, and halted at Qutbabad for the second
time. During his stay he used to visit the city for the
purposes of offering his (daily) prayers, Friday prayers,
and ‘Id (prayers). Rashid Khan daftar-dar of khalsa was
appointed to collect the money and ascertain the revenue
of some khalsa (mahals) of Haidarabad. The Emperor’s
favourite and pupil, ‘Inayetullah, mustauft of aima and
news-writer of the kachari of Khan-i-siman, became the
deputy of the Khan and got the title of Khan and an incre-
ment of 100 making him 800 [cor. 600] (60 tr.). Sardar
Khan [346] an old and trusted household slave, died. He
was devoted to the Emperor’s good and the service of the
people inwardly and outwardly alike. He loved fagirs.
His son Hamiduddin Khan who deserved the Emperor’s
favour for giving indications of fidelity, got the kotwalship
and other posts vice his deceased father. The Emperor
visited the mosque which was being built close to the private
Audience Hall, for saying his five daily [cor.] prayers and
performing his constant devotional exercises, and laid a few
stones with his own hands in order to accumulate spiritual
merit.

J‘afar Gujrati, successors at the tombs of Qutb-ul-‘Alam
[348] and Shah ‘Alam, came from Ahmadabad to interview
the Emperor, and according to the fixed custom each
received a robe, an elephant and a certain pecuniary aid

umara, Subahdar of Bihar, succeeded him at Allahabad,
and Muzaffar Khan, another son of Amir-ul-umara, became
faujdar of the sarkar of Jaunpur vice him.

Ruhullah Khan died. In lineage he was like the Sun;
in acquirements foremost in all points; of all good manners
he was the master and he set his heart on bestowing favours
on the people. As he was the son of the Emperor’s maternal
aunt’s son (cor.) and was adorned with many noble qualities,
his departure grieved His Majesty. God pardon him! One
of the signs of his being most probably pardoned was the
fact that the Emperor visited him in his last moments and
prayed to.God for pardon on his behalf. At the time of his
death he recited the verse :

.With what pride is (thy) servant leaving the
world, [349]

That you have come to his (bed) head at the time
of his giving up life!

illness, but died after passing a few stages. At this time
he used frequently to recite (verse) :

I have myself come and betaken myself to the
corner of the sepulchre,

That my bones may not burden any body’s
shoulders.

[350] He was honest and skilful in conducting business,
and quick and expert in pleasing his master. Muhammad

24th October /23rd Safar Raf‘iulgadr and Khujista Akhtar
were ordered to come to the mosque for the zuhar prayer in
company with their father. Lutfullah Khan and Asalat
Khan were sent to the thanah of As‘adnagar. Two thousand
troopers who had been reduced from Raf‘i-ul-qadr’s mansab
were restored to him. Khwaja Mubarak was appointed naib of
Khidmatgar Khan in the post of nazir of the establish-
ment of Prince Muhammad Mu‘azzam. Raja Udwat Singh,
zamindar of Urchha, serving in the army of Firuz Jang
Khan was made faujdar of [851] Irij with an increment
of 500 zat (same tr.), making him a 2-hazari (1,500 tr.)
‘Abdul Hai, mushrif of farrashkhanah, reported to the
Emperor that according to his command the residence-tent of
the Prince had been charmingly furnished. The Emperor
ordered Khidmatgar Khan and (other) servants to join the
Prince’s cortege and convey him to this mansion. On
Wednesday, the 30th November 1692 /1st Rabi. S., Kamal-
uddin Khan, faujdar of Hindaun-Bayana, was promoted by

Wednesday, the Ist March/14th Rajab, Multafat Khan,
darogha of abdar-khanah, received the-above post vice the
deceased, and was promoted by a hundred zat (50 tr.) to
the rank of a hazari (150 tr.). His office brought him close
to the Emperor’s person.

Letters of spies informed the Emperor that owing to
the scarcity of grain which prevented the army from standing
firmly, Zulfiqgar Khan Bahadur had retired twelve kos
abandoning the trenches at Jinji. Some time before this,
letters had been received stating that the enemy had
crowded round Zulfigar Khan at the siege of Jinji, that no
provision was coming to him, and that if any reinforcement
‘arrived, he would be relieved from distress. An urgent
order was issued to ‘Umdat-ul-mulk Asad Khan, who was
staying at Nandiyal, to hasten to his son’s aid. As he
delayed in going, the Emperor wrote another farman with
his own hand in open court, when I happened to be present
and overheard the Emperor saying to Fazail Khan Mir
Munshi, ‘‘Asad Khan represents himself as eager to see his
son. Now that the latter is hard pressed, he delays and
neglects in hastening to him. He might well say (verse) :

mye) Angel of Death! I am not heavy,
I am (only) an unfortunate old man.’ [353]

*Shaista Khan died in April, 1694. (P. 368.)

“It is easy to make a boast but quite another matter to
prove it true.’’ As, before going to that side ‘Umdat-ul-
mulk had openly said in his own circle, ‘‘The Emperor has
not yet assigned any task to me. If I were to be com-
missioned, he would see what a Turk can do’’ and this
speech had been reported to the Emperor, His Majesty now
addressed the aforesaid Fazail Khan and Qabil Khan, the
darogha of the library, ‘‘His Turkship i is over. How runs the
proverb?’’ Both of them recited it, as they had heard it,

‘Digar ba-khud manaz ke Turki tamam shud,
‘Don’t brag again; as your Turkship has ended,
(i.e., your boast has failed).’

This verse was embodied in the farman.

387TH YEAR OF THE REIGN :
26th April, 1693—15th April, 1694.

* * * At the gracious arrival of the blessed month of
Ramzan, exhilarating to the Muslims, the bud of ‘Id
blossomed in the garden of fasting, and the thorn and
bramble of the oppression and injury done by the infidels
were totally swept away from the flower-bed of the age. * * *

A glazed palki was sent by the Emperor to Prince
‘Azam Shah, who was attacked by dropsy, [854] so that
when journeying he might travel in care and safety. The
Emperor ordered that excepting those who kad been granted
palkis by him, none of the Princes, shahzadas and amirs
should come in a palki within the gulalbar. After a time
permission was given to ‘Umdat-ul-mulk Asad Khan and
the intimate servant Multafat Khan to come [in their
palkis] so far. The agent of the Rani of Bidnur presented
her letter and tribute, consisting of 300 hun.

THE SAD CONDUCT OF KAM BAKHSH
% * By %

‘Uindat-ul-mulk, after conquering the fort of Nandiyal
in Kadapa district, which is the frontier of Karnatak
Haidarabadi, had encamped. The Prince was sent from the
Court to capture fort Wagingera in company with Bakhshi-
ul-mulk Bahramand Khan [355] and engaged in the work.
When Bakhshi-ul-mulk Ruhullah Khan was appointed to
this task, the Prince by command turned to reinforce
‘Umdat-ul-mulk. When he arrived at Kadapa, an imperial
order was received directing him and ‘Umdat-ul-mulk to go
to the aid of Zulfiqar Khan Bahadur Nasrat Jang, who was
besieging Jinji and who had been put to hard straits by the
assembling of the enemy and the failure to get provisions.
The Prince, in his pride of youth and under the influence
of the evil counsels of flatterers and his disinclination to
listen to the words of experienced and far-seeing men,
travelled all the long way from beginning to end, stage by


--- Page 226 ---
1693 KAM BAKHSH’S MISDEEDS AT JINJI 215

stage on horseback, the journey including hunting and
visiting (noted) places. Bahramand Khan utilising his oppor-
tunities, pleased the Prince by his smoothness (of tongue)
and gentleness, and left for the Court. ‘Umdat-ul-mulk,
inspite of his great weakness and the infirmities of age, had to
undergo trouble and hardship in observing proper etiquette,
and travelled all the way on horseback in constant sadness.
But as the kernel of complaint turns into the grain of vexa-
tion in the soil of friendship, and the result of mutual opposi-
tion is calamity and disgrace, the ill-feeling between the
partisans of the two chiefs grew stronger. The displeasure
and bitterness on the two sides increased through the inter-
vention of bad men. When the army came near Jinji, Nasrat
Jang Khan advanced to welcome the Prince, and had audi-
ence. The Prince sat in the audience-hall. [856] ‘Umdat-ul-
mulk, Nasrat Jang, and Sarfaraz Khan got permission to sit
down; Lashkar Khan, son of Sayyid Khan Jahan of Barha
had expected equality of treatment with Nasrat Jang, but on
being disappointed in that hope, left the audience-hall in
anger, and never again went to interview the Prince. The
servants of the Prince alleged to Lashkar Khan that this
incident was due to the machination of the father and the
son, while these [two] generals made him believe that it
was owing to the Prince’s disfavour. All the materials for
ill-feeling and malignity were thus assembled, and these
things increased the irritability and disturbance in the
mind of the Prince. Meantime, through the agency of
some reckless fools, the Prince opened a secret corres-
pondence with Rama [Rajaram] in the fort. The enemy
were greatly encouraged by this occurrence and practised
mischief-creating and deception and misled the Prince.
Nasrat Jang who watched every direction and paid one
thousand rupees daily to his spies in the fort, learnt the
truth about this secret affair, and the father and the son
wrote to the Emperor about the state of affairs and were
permitted, at their request, to station Rao Dalpat Bundela
in constant attendance at the Prince’s residence, and to
forbid the Prince’s riding, holding court, and the ingress and
egress of strangers without the permission of ‘Umdat-ul-
mulk. The quarrel became public. The spies within the
fort repeatedly sent news that the Prince in concert with his
wicked servants [857] wanted to enter the fort on a dark
night, by reason of his difference with ‘Umdat-ul-mulk and
Nasrat Jang. The father and the son being shaken by their


--- Page 227 ---
216 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI [cH. 37

fear of the king of men, held a consultation with the chiefs
of the army and with the consent of them strengthened the
chauki (sentry) and strictness (in examining visitors) at the
door of the Prince, and by common consent called in the
thanahdars from around the fort. As soon as the army
withdrew from around the fort, the enemy getting news of
it came out in a strong body to fight, and a battle raged on
every side. ‘Umdat-ul-mulk was busy at the base-camp
(bungah) in guarding the Prince, Nasrat Jang was engaged
in the trenches in planning to remove the large guns and
other siege materials. They could not help the thanahdars ;
everyone who could come away safely by his own exertions
did so; the rest were destroyed. Isma‘il Khan Makha, a
great commander, who held the thanah in the rear of the
fort, stood up to fight; but the enemy were too many and
he was wounded and carried off through the exertions and
reinforcement of Santa. A great confusion occurred. Nasrat
Jang hastened the work of withdrawal from the trenches;
the large guns were (mekh zadah) damaged by hammering
nails into their touch-holes, and having arranged his men
he carried off all the property tothe camp. At this time the
enemy in great confidence, joy, and vigour surrounded
Nasrat Jang in a body of one lakh of horsemen and infantry.
The (Prince’s) camp was two kos and the fort-wall only a
quarter kos from the place. The audacity of the infidels
was beyond measure, and death faced the Muslims. At this
time the Khan Bahadur and all the other commanders had
not with them more than [358] 2,000 troopers. The Khan
relying on God’s help and keeping the Emperor in his
remembrance, joined the battle with a loud cry. The heroes
made brave charges, a great give and take battle was fought.
About three thousand infantry of the enemy were slain by
the Islamic ghazis, and three hundred cavalry too. The
Khan Bahadur, on an elephant drove them back to the door
of the fort, the garrison shut the gate. In this conflict one
thousand infantry of the enemy perished. The imperialists
gained the victory and the enemy took to flight, The
Muslims captured one thousand mares which the enemy had
left behind when fleeing to the fort. About four hundred
horses and four elephants of the victorious warriors were
slain by cannonball and zamburak fire. And the same
number of eager fighters from among the mansabdars of
the retinue and other corps became martyrs. Few were
unwounded. After such a great victory the Khan Bahadur


--- Page 228 ---
1693] - KAM BAKHSH RECALLED FROM JINJI 217

arrived at the camp at the end of the day, and met ‘Umdat-
ul-mulk. As they had learnt that the Prince and his
advisers had formed the plan of imprisoning the father and
the son when they would come to visit him, the two rode
out and unceremoniously entered the Prince’s house and in
fidelity to their master, took their master’s son [859] into
their custody. Next day the Khan Bahadur reassured and
cheered all the members, great and small, of the army, and
made them happy by the presentation of elephants, horses,
robes and cash rewards. He gained victories (several) times
over the enemy. As grain was exhausted and the troops
had not the strength to stand up, he made some sort of truce
with the enemy, marched away to the imperial dominions,
and halted. At this time orders were received from the
Emperor commanding that the Prince should be sent to
Court with Muharram Khan. ‘Umdat-ul-mulk set out for
the Court. The Khan Bahadur [Nasrat Jang] returned
after four months, again laid siege to the fort, and pressed
the garrison hard. I shall narrate in its place the capture
of the fort and the escape of Rama [Rajaram] and Santa.

On Wednesday, the 14th June 1693/20th Shawwal,
Kam Bakhsh arrived at the Court, and through the
mediation of Zinatunnisa Begam had an interview with the
Emperor in the harem. He presented one thousand mohars
as nazar and the same number of rupees as nisar.

An imperial order was issued that no amir to whom a
sarpech of jewellery was granted should wear it except on
Sunday ; they should be content with it and should not make
another (sarpech) themselves and should not wrap their
head [with any such unauthorised sarpech]. [360]

On Sunday, the 18th August, 1693/21st Zil. H.,
Khan Jahan Bahadur Zafar Jang Kokaltash Khan, the
dismissed nazim of Lahore, had audience. His son Himmat
Khan Bahadur the dismissed Subahdar of Allahabad, prayed
for an audience, but was ordered to convey the family of
Muhammad Mu‘izzuddin to him at Parnala. Hamiduddin
Khan, who had gone to punish the enemy returned and had
audience on Saturday the 7th October /16th Safar. Formerly
he had to stand outside the barrier (katra) railing; the
Emperor now graciously gave him the honour of standing
within it. ‘Inayetullah Khan on the occasion of the death
of his maternal uncle Mulla Muhammad Tahir, received
a shawl baldband, On Thursday, the 9th November,

Prince ‘Alijah, who had been summoned to Court on
account of his illness, (arrived) with Muhammad [861]
Bidar Bakht Bahadur and Shahzada Muhammad Walajah
on the 22nd October /2nd Rabi. A., and had audience. As
he had not yet fully recovered, the Emperor wished to be
himself his physician and nurse. (The Prince) resided in
the tent which had been set up for his residence in the
middle of the gulalbar close to the Hall of Private Audience,
and in which a hall and two rooms had been built for
sheltering him. On Sunday the 5th November, 1693/16th
Rabi. A., Muhammad Walajah became a 7-hazari (2,000 tr.)
and was given a standard and kettledrums. Khan Zaman
Fath jang, an officer of the Prince’s army, had audience.
Hakim-ul-mulk and Fazail Khan Mir Hadi, Mir Munshi,
who had been sent by the Emperor to the Prince for treating
and soothing him respectively, returned with him and had
audience. The Emperor went once every day to see the
Prince, and partook of the Prince’s sick-diet with him and
Zinat-un-nisa Begam. And that was the only food which
the two took till the Prince recovered. Thank God, through
the blessed efforts of the Emperor, the Prince recovered from
such a fatal illness. Muhammad Salim Aslam a servant of
the Prince found the date of recovery in the verse :

‘‘The Prince’s medicine was only the Emperor’s
prayer.”’ [362]

The Emperor heard it and praised the poet.

; On Saturday, the 23rd December, 1693 /5th Jamad. A.,
the Prince (on recovery) came to the Private Audience Hall, -
sat down before the Emperor, and so gladdened him.
Hakim-ul-mulk, who had shown marvellous skill in the
treatment, was rewarded with promotion of a hagdr zat

making him 4-hazaéri. Shah ‘Ali Jah narrated the history
of his own illness thus: ‘‘Three years before this dropsy
appeared, Hakim M‘asum Khan used to say indirectly in
my presence but plainly by messengers that he had observed
the symptom of dropsy in me and was trying as far as
possible to guard my health and check the disease, and that
he would feel satisfied if I took medicine, followed a strict
regimen, and abstained from the things that caused the
disease. I did not listen to the words of the deceased. Two
years after his death I reached the brink ; when I was about
to go towards Jinji, this disease appeared. Although Hakim
Muhammad Shaf‘i, Hakim Muhammad Raza, and Hakim
Muhammad Amin Sawji, worked hard, the disease became
severer, till it came to this that the girth of my sleeve was
increased to 14 gira and yet I felt it as too tight. The girth
of the cloth of my drawers (paijama) was one yard and
six gira. J abstained from whatever was iit to be given up.
Instead of water I drank essence of white succory and night-
shade. The doctors, as they were of good intention, used
to say ‘‘the Prince does not abstain’. [363] At night all
gave up hopes of recovery and expected my skin to crack.
The Begam, Muhammad Bidar Bakht, Gaiti Ara, Bakht-
un-nisa, and some other inmates of my harem, who
surrounded my couch, and I were half dosing and half awake,
when a luminous man with beard and moustaches, yellow
like wheat and barley, appeared at the foot of the bed facing
me, and standing near he said, ‘Up to this time no part of
the disease has gone away. Make sincere and unrelapsing
penitence, and God will give you quick recovery.’ I said,
‘T shall repent in any form of words that you command, and
God willing, shall not relapse into the sin.’ And so I
repented at the direction of that internally and externally
great being, and felt ease of body. He yanished. I informed
the Begam and other people and gave them the glad news
of my recovery. That instant I felt inclination to pass
water, passed two large ewer-fuls in one discharge, and felt
the traces of lightness and relief. Up to dawn this sort of
urination occurred five times, and seven parts of my swelling
disappeared. Men asked me, ‘Could you recognise the
great person who appeared at the bidding of the Great
Healer?’ I answered ‘I do not know him or his name.’
But on the second day, Shaikh ‘Abdur Rahman Darvish
wrote from Adoni forty kos from that place. ‘Today when
three gharis of night remained, His Holiness the Com-


--- Page 231 ---
220 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRi [cx. 37

mander of the Faithful ‘Ali, the son of Abu Talib, said to
me, ‘To night I ‘have given him dust, and begged his
recovery of God; he will speedily recover. Don’t doubt at
all.’ After my recovery, my servants, such as [364]
Mustafa Kashi and others distributed their own household
property with a certain amount of cash to faqirs and poor
men. Mir Zain-ul-‘Abidin gave away 12,000 rupees. After
my bath of recovery Hedait Khan held feasts for a week
and entertained (all) people, at an expenditure of 15,000
rupees. The Begam sent 60,000 rupees as present to the
blessed Najaf and the exalted Karbala. One lakh and
twenty thousand rupees were sent to the poor of Mecca and
Medina and other sacred places from (my) own purse. The
Begams and Shahzadas gave away some amount of gold to
the poor. When Hakim-ul-mulk and Fazail Khan arrived
from the Emperor, only a little swelling on the face and
hands was left. The Hakim prescribed electuary of gold;
on taking it a [new] swelling appeared. He said ‘There
is no fear, it will now totally disappear’ Then I started for
the Court. I gave 2,000 ashrafis to the Hakim, with a robe
and an elephant. Favours were conferred on Fazail Khan
too.’’

Munawwar Khan son of Fath Jang, (by an increment
of 5-sadi) became a 34-hazari (2,000 tr.). ‘Ali Mardan Khan
Haidarabadi had been captured by the enemy; on being
released he was made a 5-hazari (same tr.). ‘Umdat-ul-mulk,
who had retired from Jinji, and by command stayed at
Nasratabad Sakkhar, arrived at Court on Monday, the 8th
January, 1694/21st Jamad. A., at the Emperor’s invitation.
On account of the affair of Kam Bakhsh, he had anticipated
the severe anger of the Emperor. On the day of interview,
when he arrived [865] at the place of making salam, Mul-
tafat Khan who was standing close to the throne by virtue
of his office of darogha of the khaw4ses, recited in a low
tone :—(verse) ‘Forgiveness has a sweetness which venge-
ance lacks.’ The kind Emperor said, ‘“You have recited
it at the right time’’. Looking kindly at the chief of minis-
ters he ordered him to kiss his toes, and raised his head
from the dust of distress. Sipahdar Khan son of Kokaltish
Khan Zafar Jang, who had becdme Subahdar of Allahabad
vice Buzurg Ummed Khan deceased,* got in addition the
faujdari of Jaunpur, and the increment of 500 tr. to his

rank of 8-hazari (2,500 tr.) and one kror dim as in‘am.
Khanahzad Khan, who had gone towards Garh-namuna to
guard the way, arrived at Court on Thursday, the 8th
February, 1694/22nd Jamad. S. Bidar Bakht was sent to
chastise the enemy, receiving a dagger with a fish (mahi)
handle and pearl ‘ilaqga worth 10,000 rupees. Khan Fath
Jang, (his) sons and relatives, and others appointed to the
Prince’s army were rewarded with robes, promotion, jewels,
horses, and elephants. On Thursday, the 8th March/2I1st
Rajab* Muhammad Mu‘izzuddin, giving up the siege of
Parnala, came to Court; he was granted an interview in
company with his son ‘Izzuddin in the private chamber.
Mukhtar Khan became Mir Atish. Nawazish Khan Rumi
became defender of chakla Moradabad.

A Sayyid of Barha, who was a mansabdar and officer
of the imperial service ahd Amanullah, a trusted servant of
Shah ‘Alijah, were friends. [866] One day as they were
going together to the same place, they had words, their
friendship was broken up, and a quarrel followed.
Am§anullah fatally stabbed the Sayyid with a cutlass
(jamdhar). ‘The other Sayyids in a body went to the resi-
dence of Amanullah, situated in the camp of the Prince, on
whose side too, a large party appeared; a great tumult
occurred. The Emperor on being informed sent Mukhtar
Khan Mir Atish, to the place to try his best to brine about
a reconciliation. The Khan tried to carry out the command
and put down the tumult, but the Sayyids could not be
pacified. He reported the matter. The Emperor wrote on
the sheet of the letter the Quranic verse :—

“If two parties of the faithful quarrel, reconcile them,
and if either of them rebel against the other, you may fight
against the party that has rebelled until it inclines to the
commandment of God’’. That day passed. Next day the
Sayyids in a body sat down outside the Court of Justice.
The Emperor ordered them to go to the Qazi-ul-quzat, whose
decision according to the Holy Law would be carried out.
These fools cried out, ‘‘We wo’nt go to the Qazi. We shall
settle the matter with our enemies.’’

The Emperor became angry on hearing these words;
he rolled up his sleeves and cried out, ‘‘A group of men who
have often been beaten by me and felt my anger, dare give
such a reply when asked to conform to the Holy Law! Let

* Akhbarat shows that Mu‘izzuddin had audietce on the 28th or 29th
March: so the 8th March was the date on which he started from Parndala.

as many of them as may be here, come on in a body.’’ He
ordered all the Sayyids serving in the khds chauki and the
old retinue to be dismissed, and to be expelled from the tent
in front of the door of the ghusalkhanah where they used to
sit. [867] No man durst now speak a word. Saif Khan
and Sayyid Khan and other chiefs of the Sayyids like them,
took refuge in the houses of influential grandees and pro-
tested a thousand times, ‘‘We were not in it’’. hey
remained under disfavour and removal from service for some
time, and were then reinstated through petitioning and
mediation. ‘They restrained their breath in their throats
and sat down on the knees of good manners. On one of
these days some twenty of the servants of Mu‘izzuddin
became rude to his diwan Fazl ‘Ali Khan and like ruffians
acted so violently that every one who tried to reason with
them met with abuse only. Wheh it was reported to the
Emperor, he ordered Hamiduddin Khan to go and punish
these men, as the recent affair of the Sayyids had disgusted
his mind. When the Khan went there they did not withdraw
but rushed into the burning fire. The capacity of moths is
well-known ; if a thousand of them collect together, they
cannot fill a closed fist. But when those few desperate
men charged these thousand men, all of the latter were
shaken and they fled away uncontrollably. At this time the
elephant of the Khan Bahadur frightened by the crowd and
tumult, stampeded out of the field and ran for one kos
towards the Badshahi ganj. The Khan saw before him a
large thatched house in which grain was heaped up. The
instant the elephant came beside it, he coolly. jumped down
on it from his howda [368]. People pursued and brought
back the elephant. The Khan returned tc the battle’ on
another remount. Ultimately the men were destroyed by
the fire of their own kindling.

News came that Amir-ul-umara Shidista Khan,
Subahdar of Agra, had died. The excellent qualities and
praiseworthy virtues of this noble amir were such that the
fame of his liberality and charity enveloped the sky. His
memorials are the many caravan-serais and bridges which
he built at the cost of lakhs all over Hindustan. Salih Khan,
son of ‘Azam Khan Kokah, got his father’s first title Fidai
Khan and leaving the faujdari of Gwalior, became Subahdar
[869] of Agra vice the deceased. Bakhshi-ul-mulk Bahra-

5th April, 1695—24th March, 1696.

* * * *

The Emperor passed the month of Ramzan here, as
Brahmapuri was not fit for his residence (as yet). One day
Khan Jahan Bahadur Zafar Jang presented to the Emperor
a small circular China ewer in the Court house (‘adalatgah),
[371] saying that it was the cup of Moses. The Emperor
glancing at it, gave it to Princes Muhammad Mu‘izzuddin
and Muhammad ‘Azim. On its neck were inscribed two lines
of drawings resembling writing. The Shahzadas said,
‘“Then this writing must be Hebrew.’’ The Khan Bahadur
looking at the characters said, ‘‘I don’t know Hebrew or
Mebrew. The man who sold it gave this information’’.
The Emperor said ‘‘These are letters, and the workmanship
is not bad’’. Many wonderful and fantastic anecdotes are
current among the people about this merry and virtuous
Khan. But as the above incident happened in my presence,
I write it as his memorial.

The Emperor ordered Nazir Khidmatgar Khan with
Khwaja Manzur to take a special robe to Muhammad
Mu‘azzam’s house, and bring him to the prayer-room to
make his bow for it. He then came with the Emperor to the
diwan-i-‘adalat, offered two-fold prayers and was permitted
to kiss the feet . the Emperor kissed his forehead. After
being presented with a diamond sarpech worth one lakh of
rupees, a sword, two horses with enamel and gold saz, and
an elephant with silver saz and talair, he was sent back to
his mansion. Khudabanda Khan son of Amir-ul-umara,
after his father’s death came to Court from the faujdari of
Bahraich, and got a mourning robe. Hamiduddin Khan on
receiving an increment of 100 tr. became a 1}-hazari
(500 tr.).

As the [872] eldest son of the Emperor always sat on
His Majesty’s right hand and during Shah ‘Alam’s
‘retreat’ (disgrace), Shah Alijah had been given that’
honour, the eldest ‘prince asked the Emperor, ‘‘What

29


--- Page 237 ---
226 _ MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI [cH. 39

is your Majesty’s order about my right on the day of ‘Id?”’
He replied, ‘‘Go to the ‘Idgah before my cortege and you
will sit on my right side’’. He did so. When the cortege
reached the steps, Mu‘azzam advanced, interviewed, and
kissed the feet of the Emperor, who, after. shaking hands
with him took his left hand in his own rignt hand and went
to the mosque, and so it happened that the eldest son sat on
the right, touching the Emperor. Shah ‘Alijah who came
behind and had a special sword in his hand, deposited it be-
fore the Emperor, and touched the arm of his brother wish-
ing him to make room for him and let him sit down on the
right side of the Emperor. His Majesty’s glance fell on
that side; with his right hand he grasped the skirt of ‘Alijah
and brought him to the left side. Who else had the audacity
to advance or hang back? After the prayers had been said
and the khatib had ascended the pulpit (mimbar), as soon as
the Emperor’s name was uttered (by the Khatib), His
Majesty rose up holding the hand of ‘Alijah, and made a
sign to the eldest Prince to depart. Shah ‘Alam went out
with his sons by the third door and the Emperor by the
second.

Zakiat-un-nisa and Safiyyat-un-nisa, daughters of
Muhammad Akbar, who had come to Court by command,
were ordered to be married to Raf‘i-ul-qadr and Muhammad
Khujistah Akhtar. On Thursday, the 9th May, 1695 /5th
Shawwal Prince Muhammad Mu‘azzam [873] came to the
prayer-room and made his bow for the robe of farewell to
[act as Subahdar of] Agra, which had been sent to his
mansion with Khwaja Manzur. He then went with His
Majesty to the diwan-i-‘adalat, and kissed his feet, the
Emperor kissing his forehead, and dismissing him after
reciting the fatiha. Of his sons Muhammad Raf‘i-ul-qadr
and Khujistah Akhtar were sent with him, and Muhammad
Mu‘izzuddin and Muhammad ‘Azim were left with the
Emperor ; (they) were ordered to accompany the Prince to
his camp (daira).

THE EMPEROR’S MARCH FROM BIJAPUR TO BRAHMAPURI
RENAMED ISLAMPURI. (1695).

On Saturday, the 11th May/7th Shawwal the imperial
army moved from Nauraspur and Afzalpur, and reached
Brahmapuri on the bank of the Bhima on Tuesday, the 21st /
17th Shawwal, By order, all the Emperor’s sons, shah-

zadas, and nobles made their ‘‘bow of blessing”’, on the
occasion of arrival here. On the way to his mansion the
Emperor passed by the tent of Shah ‘Alijah; the circuit of
the daira appeared to him to be too large. The surveyor
was ordered to measure the area, and restrict it to the area
of Aurangzib’s own daira before his accession. A son was
born to Muhammad ‘Azim and the daughter of Ruhullah
Khan [874], the father presented 500 mohars as nazar; the
son was named Ruh-ul-quds. On Friday, the 23rd August /
22nd Muharram a son was born to Bidar Bakht and Mukhtar
Khan’s daughter. Shah ‘Alijah made his bow at Court and
presented 500 mohars; the newly-born child) was named
Firuz Bakht. On Sunday, the 22nd September /22nd Safar,
Muhammad Mu‘izzuddin and ‘Azim, when getting leave to
go to Agra, went to visit Shah ‘Alijah and each received a
robe with balaband, half-sleeves, turban-end and necklace of
pearls, and an elephant. Khudabanda Khan was married to
‘Umdat-ul-mulk’s daughter, and got a robe. Zulfiqar Khan
Bahadur was promoted to a 5-hazari (4,000 tr.), Bakhshi-
ul-mulk Bahramand Khan a 5-hazari (3,000 tr.), Bakhshi-
ul-mulk Mukhlis Khan a 3-hazari (1,000 tr.) and Hamid-
ud-din Khan a 2-hazart.

A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE DISASTER THAT BEFELL KHANAHZAD
KHAN AND QASIM KHAN BAHADUR.

When the Emperor learnt that Santa after robbing the
imperial dominions was hastening with heavy loads to his
own country, [3875] and would pass within eighteen kos of
the imperial camp, he ordered Qasim Khan, an active and
able officer who was commander of the country of Sera and
had arrived near Sera, to go with his army to the path of
the enemy and to punish him severely in company with
Khanahzad Khan, Saf Shikan Khan, Sayyid Asalat Khan,
Muhammad Murad Khan and others who had been sent by
the Emperor with forces composed of the mansabdars of the
khas chauki, the khas retinue and a large party from the
7-chauki and artillery.

On Sunday, the 19th January /23rd Jamad. S.,* the two

*The date given here is wrong by two months. Akhbarat 3972 shows
that Qasim Khan had been killed more than a month before 19th January
1696, and that 19th January, 1696 was the date on which imace-bearers sent
to succour Khanhzad after the disaster and urge Hamiduddin on, returned to
the Emperor’s side. Fort St. George Diary, 5th December, 1695 records “A
credible report that a Maratha army of about 15,000 men are coming into
these parts and have already defeated Qasim Khan Nawab of Sira.”



--- Page 239 ---
228 . MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI [cH. 39

’
forces united six kos from the track of the enemy. As
Qasim Khan’s household property was at Adoni and he
wished to entertain Khwaja Khanahzad Khan and others
to his heart’s content, he brought out of the fort showy
articles, like Karnataki tents not yet used, gold, silver,
copper and china vessels of all kinds, and sent them the
next day with his own advance-tents and those of other amirs
to a distance of three kos (in advance). The enemy learning
of the arrival of the advance-tents, divided his army into
three bodies, of which one went to plunder the camp, the
second to encounter the army, and the third was kept ready
(in reserve), At four gharis after dawn the first body fell
upon the advance-tents, slew and wounded many, and
carried off everything. All of a sudden the news reached
Qasim Khan, who without rousing Khanahzad Khan from
his sleep, hastened to the battle. [876] Before he had gone
one kos, the second body of the enemy told off for the battle
appeared and began to fight. Khanahzad Khan, on waking,
heard of it and leaving the baggage camp, porters, burdens,
and tents there, advanced quickly. As the enemy had a
numberless force of ‘‘black infantry’? musketeers and a
very large body of cavalry too, a great battle was fought,
and many were slain on both sides. In spite of the firmness
of the imperial generals and men, and the loss of the enemy,
the latter did not yield one foot of ground or show the least
shaking. At this time the third or reserve division of the
enemy fell upon the camp and baggage left behind and
plundered everything. When this news reached Khanahzad
Khan and Qasim Khan in the very heat of the battle, their
firmness was shaken, they held a consultation and resolved
to go to the place where the advance tents had been sent,
where there was a small fort (qilacha) named Dodderi and
a tank before it. Fighting for a kos they arrived at the
tank in the evening. The enemy now left this party at
peace, and formed their ddiva on one side. The imperial
men who were in the small fort shut the gates upon them.
The two Khans shared the food they had brought with the
others; and the common soldiers had nothing to eat except
the water of the tank, not to speak of grass and gram for
the horses and elephants. As the night closed, the enemy
surrounded [877] the imperialists who stood ready to fight.
But for three days the enemy only appeared in view without
fighting ; till some thousand infantry from the zamindar of
Chitaldurg, who had been humiliated by Qasim Khan,


--- Page 240 ---
1696] QASIM KHAN’S DISASTER AT DODDERI 229

came out to fight on getting an opportunity. On the fourth
day, before it was dawn, ten times the former number of
(black) infantry darkened the plain and began to fight. As
the artillery ammunitions had been plundered, and what
had been brought with the soldiers had been exhausted, the
troops sat down in helplessness, after running about and
groaning and sighing for some hours. As the enemy con-
tinued to hail musketballs, many men were destroyed here
also. The survivors, seeing the path of egress closed to
them, forced their way into the small fort. Trustworthy
reporters who were present at the catastrophe and fought
boldly said, ‘‘One-third of our soldiers were slain by the
infidels in the two advance-tents (pesh-khanahs), on the
way, and on the bank of the tank. The enemy besieged the
fort on all sides and felt sure that the garrison would die of
hunger. On the day of entering the fort, all the soldiers,
high and low, were given bread of jawar and bajra out of
the provisions of the place, and the straw of old and new
thatches to the cattle. On the second day neither was bread
left for men nor barley for the horses. In this irremediable
distress, if life departs let it depart; Qasim Khan was an
inveterate opium-eater, his life depended on it, the lack of
opium [3878] became the cause of his death. He died on the
third day, and thus escaped the enemy, who became bolder
on hearing the news. The garrison were correspondingly
depressed. Though the enthusiasts said, ‘‘How long should
we bear hunger and die in this miserable way? Let us once
fling ourselves on the infidels, and gain either martyrdom
or victory. In either case, we shall escape from distress and
gain merit,’’ the chiefs did not assent to it. And while many
died of hunger and the: horses chewed each other’s tails
mistaking them for straw, the enemy overthrew one tower
and raised tumult on all sides. Khanahzad Khan begged for
safety, and a truce was made on condition that he would
surrender to Santa the cash, articles, jewels, horses, and
elephants of Qasim Khan, besides twenty lakhs of rupees,
and that the son of Balkishan, his trusted munshi and chief
officer of his household, would be hostage. It was agreed.
Santa sent word that the men might come out of the fort
without any misgiving and stay two nights in front of the
gate ; those who had anything need fear no molestation ; they
might buy from his soldiers what they needed. The imperial
soldiers left the fort after three days. From one side the
enemy gave them bread and from the other water. They


--- Page 241 ---
230 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI [cH. 39

stayed two nights at the gate of the fort. On the third day,
Khanahzad Khan started for the Court with an escort of the
enemy. Hamiduddin Khan Bahadur who had been sent
from the Court and Rustamdil Khan from Haidarabad to
aid the besieged, united near Adoni. [379] They gave neces-
sary help to the defeated nobles in the form of tents, dress,
and cash. R‘adandaz Khan, qiladar, exerted himself in
helping beyond his means, and articles more than they
needed were collected from the houses of all (the citizens)
and from all sides. The enemy, who after gaining such
booty had started for their homes, wished to fight Himmat
Khan Bahadur, who on account of the smallness of his force,
was staying at Basvapatan inspite of his having received an
order to punish the enemy.

DEATH OF HIMMAT KHAN.

The Khan Bahadur who had not more than a thousand
soldiers with him, reached the enemy, and seemed likely
to defeat them, when suddenly a musket-shot struck his
breast, and he died instantly. The elephant-driver wanted
to turn back, but Bagi Beg, commander of the Khan’s con-
tingent, arrived there and told him, ‘‘The Khan is alive;
drive the elephant forward. I shall drive away the enemy’’.
He encountered the enemy and stood his ground well. But
how long can a headless (army) make a stand? There was a
small fort at hand, and he entered it. The enemy plundered
his baggage, and besieged the fort for some days. Then
finding it fruitless, they withdrew; Baqi Beg seized the
opportunity and came to Court. The Emperor ordered

Mukhlis Khan presented to the Emperor a poetical work
(diwan) of Saib in Saib’s own handwriting contain-
ing one lakh of couplets. As most of his poems
are considered the choicest in the world and as they
deal with moral advice and _ spiritual improvement,
the Emperor accepted it. And for a long time the
following ghazal was recited in the Emperor’s Court, and
men of wit used to imitate it, [omitted]. [882] T arbiyat
Khan, who had gone to punish the enemy towards the hill

that Prince Muhammad Mu‘azzam had on Friday, the 2nd
July /22nd Zil. H., started for Multan, by order of the
Emperor. [383] Iradat Khan II named Mubarakullah, son

and received praise and the title of Bahadur. At his request
Rustamdil Khan and other subordinates received proper
promotions. Shuja‘et- Khan Muhammad Beg, nazim of
Ahmadabad, became a 4-hazari (same tr.). The Emperor
learnt that ‘Agil Khan Subahdar of Delhi, had died. He
was endowed with asceticism, freedom of spirit, independ-
ence (of worldly possessions), and control of mind. He served
with vigilance and treated his peers with haughtiness.
Mahabat Khan Ibrahim, who was made Subahdar of Lahore,
applied to the Emperor for permission to view the fort and
palace-buildings of Delhi. A ‘by order’ granting the prayer
was written to the Khan (‘Aqil Khan). He wrote to the
Emperor in reply, ‘‘I shall not invite him (to the fort) for
certain objections : First, he is a Haidarabadi and not a man
of such position that he should be allowed to view an imperial
palace for his diversion. Secondly, the doors of all the
rooms have -been closed, lest (the things within) should be
handled; the chambers are without carpets, and the sight-
seer is not such (an important person) that for his sake the
palace should be cleaned and spread with carpets. [384]
Then, again, at interview he will not behave in the manner
I expect. Therefore there are preponderating reasons for
not admitting him.’”’ When he arrived at Delhi and sent a
message about this desire, ‘Aqil Khan did not invite him,
but gave a sharp and rough reply, and he had to leave for
his destination. The Emperor shut his eyes to the Khan’s
selfwill and haughtiness on account of his long service,
honesty, and devotion, and entrusted the discharge of
important tasks to him. He was not without external
accomplishments. Razi was his pen-name, and he has left a
poetical work and masnavis behind. He considered himself
peerless in solving the difficult minute points of the masnavi
of Maulana Rumi. He was liberal and charitable by nature.

Muhammad Yar Khan, who after going from the Court
to Delhi, was without employment, became Subahdar of
Delhi vice the deceased. He was a 24-hazari (1,500 tr.) and

FLOOD OF THE BHIMA

One of the marvellous occurrences of this mirage-like
deceptive world, which is a testing ground (for true manhood)
was the raging up in billows, of the waterless calamity-breed-
ing ocean and the whirling of the fire-showering circle (the
heavens), in a tempest of clouds. It took the form of the out-
break of a second Noah’s flood, on the morning of Monday,
the 19th July, 1697/10th Muharram, in the river Bhima.
Owing to heavy rains at a distance, [888] a terrible flood
swept down, the very sight of which robbed people of their
lives; none had the courage to look at it. Every moment the
current, violence and wildness increased.

% * * Ey

At a distance of thirty kos from Bahadurgarh was the
camp of Shah ‘Alijah; the stores of fodder and fuel (panthi
wood) which the merchants had collected, came down the
river without being scattered. Many of the villages were


--- Page 248 ---
1697 | IMPERIAL CAMP FLOODED BY BHIMA 237

totally destroyed by the force of the flood. The men and
cattle seated on thatches were carried helplessly down, by
the swift flowing water. Natural enemies like cats and mice,
dogs and hares, looking at each other trembled for their own
lives and drifted down peacefully together. After the water
had extended and covered the plain, the misls of ‘Umdat-ul-
mulk Asad Khan, Mukhlis Khan and others—many of
(these) rich men having built charming houses on the bank
of the river at great expense—were destroyed by the flood.
The rich men got into boats and reached the bank of safety
after being tossed about. Others lost both life and property
in the river. * *

[389] The hillock on which stood the mansion of Wala
Shukoh, the tents of Shah ‘Alijah, of Kam Bakhsh and
other great and poor men, was forty yards high, more or
less. In three days only ‘four yards of it remained above
water. Through God’s grace, the water began to subside,
in the middle of the third night, and | the people were released
from the captivity of water. * *

As the illness of Khan Jahan Bahadur Zafar Jang grew
severer, the Emperor while returning from Sholapur visited
him at his house on Saturday, the 20th November, 1697 /
16th Jamad. A. The Khan was confined to his bed and could
not rise; the Emperor sat on the masnad, and the Khan
continued to lament that he could not kiss the imperial feet.
He said, ‘‘I had wished to die in battle and thus be of service
to Your Majesty.’”’ The Emperor replied, [890] ‘‘You
have been devoting yourself to my service all through your
life, and yet your desire for it is not satisfied!’’ Behold a
servant’s devotion and a master’s favour! On Tuesday, the
23rd November, 1697 /19th Jamad. A., the Khan died. He
was a grand amir, full of piety and virtues, and a great com-
mander. His assembly (muhafil) was of great splendour, in
which few persons spoke except he alone; he himself said
what he desired; others had nothing to say except ‘‘Yes,
it is so!’’ He did not like much talk. In his assemblies,
the topics of conversation were mostly verse, prose, sword,
jewel, horse, elephant, and aphrodisiacs. He did so many
well-executed tasks and acts of bravery that even a few of
them can not be recorded here.

On Friday, the 24th December, 1697 /20th Jamad. S.,
Kam Bakhsh was made Subahdar of Berar. He was a 20-
hazari (7,000 tr.), and now got 3,000 tr. more. Mirak

Husain, his diwan, went as his deputy. As ‘Umdat-ul-
mulk’s illness made it difficult for him to sign his name,
the Emperor in order to expedite business ordered ‘Inayet-
ullah Khan to sign. ‘Umdat-ul-mulk Asad Khan placed
before His Majesty Zulfiqar Khan Bahadur Nasrat Jang’s
despatch, announcing that the Islamic heroes, with God’s
help, [891] had captured Jinji which was situated on a high
hill and enjoyed the greatest fame and pre-eminence among
the forts and strong places of Karnatak in respect of height
and abundance of materials of war and defence, and that he
had slain large numbers of the infidels; and that the wretch
Rama [Rajaram] who had taken refuge in this stronghold,
being frightened at seeing the valour and hearing of
the assault of the ever-victorious army, had fled away from
the fort, leaving his family, property and things behind.
On Monday, the 7th February, 1698/16th Shaban, this
strong fortress, consisting of seven forts, was forcibly cap-
tured and annexed to the Empire. Four wives, three sons
and two daughters of the luckless infidel, his dependants,
friends, and assistants were made prisoners. And the hun-
dred other forts which make up the kingdom of Karnatak
with some ports of the Europeans, were annexed to the
empire. The powerful and rich zamindars (of the country)
submitted and sent suitable tributes to the Emperor through
the Khan Bahadur. ‘Umdat-ul-mulk in reward for the
excellent work, [392] got an increment of a hazar tr. making
him a 7-hazari (same tr.); Nasrat Jang by an increment of a
hazar tr. became a 5-hazari (same tr.), Rao Dalpat, an officer
of Nasrat Jang, who had endured great labour and hardship
in this war, was a 24-hazari (1,300 tr.), and got an incre-
ment of 5-sad (200 tr.). The conquered fort was named
Nasrat-garh. ‘Itiqad Khan who was appointed Subahdar
of Agra, vice Mukhtar Khan, had his 500 conditional tr.
made unconditional, and was given kettledrums. Siaddat
Khan died of pestilence. His son got his title, and with his
other relatives received mourning robes and promotions.
The post of darogha of the diwan-i-khas, vacated by his
death was given to Ruhullah Khan as an addition to his own
post of Khan-i-saman ; Qazi ‘Abdullah became Sadr.

3rd March, 1698—20th February, 1699.

oh oR By Bd

As in the last year, this year too, the Emperor went to
Sholapur to pass the month of Ramzan in religious obser-
vances. On the 2nd April occurred the ‘Id-ul-fitr. Shah-
zada Bidar Bakht Bahadur who had been summoned from
Bahadurgarh to Court, halted at Deogdon. Bakhshi-ul-
mulk Bahramand Khan and Mansur Khan, Mir Tuzuk,
advanced to welcome him and conducted him to the Emperor.
Before coming to the Audience Hall, the interview took
place in the mosque. He was sent towards Parnala and pre-
sented with a robe with sarpech of ruby and emerald, a
jewelled punchhi, a horse, and an elephant. The officers of
his force all got suitable favours. Bhagu Banjarah, who
on his first coming to the Emperor had got the rank of a
5-hazari (4,000 tr.) and had afterwards joined the enemy,
again came over to the Emperor and was restored to his
former rank, and given a robe, a horse, and an elephant.
(Verse) :—

This my court is not a court of despair; Even if
you have broken your repentence hundred times,
come (unto me) again.

Qazi ‘Abdullah died of (lateral) paralysis. Muhammad
Akram, one of the hereditary muftis of Delhi, who had been
serving as qazi of Aurangabad was summoned to court to
act as qazi of the imperial camp. ‘Inayetullah Khan was
ordered that, as the department of the Sadr was a part of the
department of the diwan, he should discharge the former
work as deputy, till the appointment of another Sadr. He
was a 9-sadi (70 tr.), and now got a sadi (80 tr.) more. The
Emperor sent with Nur-ul-Haq a gracious farman, eagerly
inviting his brother Shaikh-ul-Islam [894] to come to the
Court, as he had not come once to the Court after his resig-
nation of the qaziship and return from the Holy Land, but


--- Page 251 ---
240 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI [cH. 42

was staying at Ahmadabad. The Emperor’s desire was to
appoint him Sadr, if he consented after reaching Court.
The holy man was planning to go to the Court, when a severe
illness overtook him and he hastened to the world for which
he had been feeling a great desire. The Emperor sent orders
to Muhammad Amin Khan, to hasten to the Court from the
army of Firuz Jang Khan, in order to take up this post (of
Sadr). Arshad Khan Abul ‘Ala, son-in-law of Amanat
Khan, had reached court after service in Kabul, and was
now appointed diwan of Khalsa vice Kifayet Khan deceased.

News came to the Court that Amir Khan Subahdar of
Kabul had died on Thursday, the 28th April, 1698 /27th
‘Shawwal. He was a perfectly beneficent amir, of high
dignity, one of the chief servants of the Crown, and a loyal
expert officer. Among his great feats was the regulation and
settlement of the disordered administration of the province
of Kabul. The Emperor greatly trusted him. As he was the
son of the Emperor’s maternal aunt and had done excellent
services and had thus displayed his greatness of character
in the period of prince-ship, His Majesty was very sorry
for his death. He sent an order to Mu‘azzam to start for
taking charge of Kabul, with [895] a sarpech worth 50,000
rupees.

On Friday, the 20th May, 1698/20th Zil. Q., Durgi-
das Rathor, through the intercession of Shuja‘et Khan
Subahdar of Ahmadabad, brought to Court, as the instru-
ment of his pardon, Buland Akhtar, son of Muhammad
Akbar, who was born during that Prince’s wanderings in
the land of the Rathors, left there on his flight from the
country, and brought up by the Rajputs with a view to
causing tumult and confusion. At his interview Durgadas
came with his wrists tied together. The Emperor ordered
him to be unbound, and gave him a robe, a jewelled dagger
and the rank of 3-hazari (2,500 tr.). Buland Akhtar had
audience in the private-chamber and got a robe and a
sarpech; his residence (daira) was placed within the gulal-
bar. Abul Fath Khan, son of Khan Jahan (Bahadur)
deceased, got a robe and a horse and permission to go to
Delhi, in order to be married there. Neknam Khan, son of
Himmat Khan, and grandson of Islam Khan, became
bakhshi and news-writer of the force of Bidar Bakht Baha-
dur and was made a hazari (800 tr.) by’ an increment of a
sad, (200 tr.). Chin Qalich Khan Bahadur after punishing
the enemy near Bijapur, came to Court, Satva Daflé, had

audience, through the mediation of Mun‘im Khan, and got
the rank of a 6-hazari (5,000 tr.) and kettledrums. Bakhshi-
ul-mulk Mukhlis Khan became a 3-hazdri (200 tr.). ‘Tar-
biyat Khan [396] Mir Atish, who was sent towards Berar
to break up the enemy’s chhauni, became a 24-hazari (1,200
tr.). Ruhullah Khan, Khan-i-saman, got the same mansab.
Muhtasham Khan, son of Shaikh Mir deceased, was
reinstated after dismissal, as a 2-hazari (1,000 tr.). Chin
Qalich Khan Bahadur was sent against the enemy near
Kota, and presented with a belt dagger.

Hedait-kesh Bholanath, a convert to Islam, son of
Chhattar Mal, became the head (kul) news-reporter after his
father’s entry into hell. Fazl ‘Ali Khan (son of) Murshid
Quli Khan became diwan of Multan. Mulla Abul Qasim
had been enjoying a daily stipend:of one rupee, on condition
of chanting the Quran at the tomb of Shah ‘Alijah’s mother
in Aurangabad. He was admitted as one of the new Deccani
mansabdars, and on account of his accomplishments he
become a high officer and the first bakhshi of Kam Bakhsh
and diwan of Bijapur, and got the title of Darait Khan. He
used to say, ‘“‘I have a taste for poetry (taba‘-i-mauzani)
too’’. He took the pen-name of Tez-hush on account of his
acuteness. Hamiduddin Khan Bahadur who had gone to
demolish a temple and build a mosque (in its place) in Bija-
pur, having excellently carried out his orders, came to Court
and gained praise and the post of darogha of ghusalkhanah,
which brought him near the Emperor’s person. ‘Askar ‘Ali
Khan Haidarabadi, was appointed Subahdar of Berar vice
Kam Bakhsh. Muhammad Amin Khan on coming to Court,
got [3897] the post of Sadr of all Hindustan, and three
emerald rings with silver enamel. Muhammad Akram came
to Court from Aurangabad and became Qazi of the imperial
camp. MHaibatullah ‘Arab, having brought from Haidara-
bad things worthy of Emperors, presented them. Among
them was a copy of the Nehaiya written by Mulla ‘Abdullah,
(the cook); the Emperor had got the first: volume and had
been longing for the second. He rewarded the man with
an elephant, an increment of fifty troopers, a mansab of
hazari, and 1,000 rupees. Qutbuddin, envoy of Bukhara,
had audience. On the day of interview he was given a robe,
10,000 rupees, a mohar weighing 200 mohars, a rupee
weighing 200 rupees, and on the day of farewell, a female
elephant and 15,000 rupees. Zabardast Khan, subahdar of

Khan was appointed to patrol round Parenda, and presented
with a robe and an enamelled dagger.

VYAQUT, EUNUCH, WOUNDED WITH AN ARROW:

Khwaja Yaqut, nazir of Kam Bakhsh, owing to his
sincere fidelity and devotion to his master’s interests, some-
times spoke to him true but harsh words [898], which
offended some ruffians. who had access to the Prince and
stuck in his service. The villains wished to pierce him with
an arrow. On Monday, the 12th December, 1698/18th
Jamad S., when he was returning at night from the Prince’s
palace to his own house, a rascal, who was waiting on the
way for an opportunity, shot a two-forked lance-like arrow
at him. As he had some life still left in him, the Defender
of Life prevented the arrow from entering into the
membrane of his stomach, and made his arm serve as a
shield. Otherwise he would have been killed.

(Verse) If the enemy is strong, the Protector is stronger
still.

When the Emperor learnt of it, * * * he decided to
inquire into the matter in order to protect his servants and
ordered the chief of police of the camp to imprison five of
the chief jam‘adars of the Prince’s service, and to exert
himself in finding out the archer. The kotwal, after getting
hold of four men who loyally surrendered themselves,
reported that the Kokah (foster-brother) of the Prince was
refractory. The Emperor ordered that Khwaja Muhammad,
the Prince’s bakhshi, [3899] should bring the man to His
Majesty. The bakhshi, after softening him with flattering
words brought him in his company near the imperial palace,
when he turned back at the instigation of some wicked men.
What could he do? Fate was adverse to him. Khwaja
Muhammad reported to the Emperor, ‘‘He will not come,
and is making preparations for disobedience.’’ The Emperor
ordered that the Prince should expel him from the camp.
The Prince summoned him, gave him two hundred ashrafis,
a tent, and porters, and sent him away, and was displeased at
his expulsion. He had not yet crossed the river, when the
Emperor sent a message to the Prince, ordering him to bring
this man with himself to His Majesty’s Court and to inter-
cede for the pardon of his insolence. The Prince summon-
ing him back, took him to the Court. On being informed of
it, the Emperor ordered the Prinee to come to the Presence,


--- Page 254 ---
1698] SANTA GHORPARE’S DEATH 243

leaving the Kokah in the diwan-i-khds. The Prince
replied, ‘“This man and I must have audience at the same
place,’’ and after taking off his own balaband, he tied the
Kokah to his person firmly round the waist. When these
unpleasant acts were reported, the Emperor ordered him to
remain in the Court-house (‘adalatgah). Then according to
command, Bakhshi-ul-mulk Mukhlis Khan conveyed good
advice to him. As fate was then hostile to the Prince, he
did not listen to the good counsel. Hamiduddin Khan Baha-
dur was ordered to separate this bad companion from the
Prince. The Prince drew his dagger (katar), the Khan
grasped his hand to wrest it. The Khan received a cut, but
through God’s mercy the Prince remained safe; and what
happened happened to that wretch. [400] The Emperor on
learning of it, ordered that a tent should be set up near the
jewel-room and the Prince confined in it by way of punish-
ment, and the Kokah should be sent to prison for punish-
ment. The Prince was dismissed from his mansab, and all
his wealth, furniture, and insignia of dignity were confis-
cated. By order, the Prince’s chief officers were brought
before the Emperor, presented with robes, and taken into
His Majesty’s service.

At this time the head of Santa, sent by Ghaziuddin
Khan Firuz Jang, reached the Court, and was ordered to
be paraded through the chief parts of the Deccan. In many
places of this book something has been already narrated
about the villain; the rest of his history is this :—After
the affair of Dodderi and the martyrdom of Himmat Khan
Bahadur, Santa wanted to go towards Jinji. An imperial
order to pursue him reached Hamiduddin Khan Bahadur
who left the company of Ruhullah Khan to carry out the
order, arrived quickly, fought with him, and recovered some
of the elephants of Qasim Khan. ‘Then an order reached
the Khan that Bidar Bakht had been ordered to chase him,
and that he should come to Court leaving some of his officers
who had been appointed to accompany the Prince behind.
The Shahzada too had severe fights with the wretch, who
escaped in safety every time. On the way to Jinji [401]
the villain had had a fight with Dhana Jadav, who was
conveying Raja Rama to Jinji, on account of an old quarrel.
Santa triumphed, and capturing Amrit Rao, brother-in-law
of Nagoji, the companion and assistant of Dhana, had
him trampled down by an elephant. He also captured Raja
Rama, but Dhana escaped. The next day Santa appeared


--- Page 255 ---
244 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI [cu. 42

with his hands tied together before Raja Rama and said,
“‘T am the same servant (as before). My rudeness was due
to this that you wanted to make Dhana my equal, and to
reach Jinji, through his help. I shall now do any service
that you may command’’. He released and conducted Raja
Rama to Jinji. In fighting with Zulfiqar Khan Bahadur,
intriguing to instigate Kam Bakhsh, throwing the siege into
confusion, and in capturing Ism‘ail Khan Makha, he took
a leading part. When the fort was captured, he fled with
Raja Rama, and went towards Satara to fight with Dhana,
who was there. In this battle with Dhana fortune deserted
Santa, he was severely defeated and fled from the field with
only a few men to the zamindari of Nagoji, with whom he
sought refuge. Nagoji politely gave him shelter in his
house ; but his wife, whose brother had been slain by Santa,
urged her husband and another brother not to let him go
away alive. Nagoji dismissed him with friendliness but his
wife’s brother went in pursuit, seeking for an opportunity
of wreaking vengeance. At this time an imperial order to
pursue Santa [402] reached Firuz Jang, and in addition to
his own troops, the troops of Shahzada (Bidar Bakht) and
Hamiduddin Khan were placed under his c.mmand. Matlab
Khan, who was appointed sazdwal, on hearing this news
came upon Santa. The stories vary, but he was either seized
by the Khan and sent to hell, or was slain by the same
claimant of blood (Mané’s brother-in-law) ; his head fell into
the hands of the soldiers of Firuz Khan and was sent to the
Emperor. * * * * In return for this splendid service, the
Khan was rewarded with a turban (‘dmat), in addition to
praise; and Matlab Khan got an increment of 500.

CHAPTER XLIII
43RD YEAR OF THE REIGN: 1110 A. H.

21st February, 1699—9th February, 1700.
€ * * *

The Emperor went to Sholapur to pass the month of
Ramzin and to celebrate the ‘Id. Mansur Khan was ordered
to bring the harem of Kam Bakhsh from the base (bungah).
M‘amur Khan became faujdar of Karnatak vice Atish Khan
deceased. Hamiduddin Khan Bahadur [403] became
darogha of the second jewellery department vice Muharram
Khan (Khwaja Muharram ‘Ali-Mardan Khaini) deceased.
Rustam Beg Khan Circassian, one of the relatives
of Rustam Khan Bahadur Shah-Jahani, who had newly
come to India and got into service, became qiladar of Man-
galbida vice Yahya Khan. The Emperor ordered that Kam
Bakhsh should perform the zuhar prayer in the mosque of
the palace of Hasan-bari and the ‘asar prayer in company
with the Emperor. Muhammad Amin, deputy of Sarbarah
Khan Kotwal, was ordered that, as Mirak Husain the dis-
missed diwan and naib of the Prince had misappropriated '
large amounts of imperial money, he should confine him in
the chabutra and realise what the diwani officers would
report as due from him.

I knew this noble; he had many praiseworthy qualities
but had no genius for conducting business. One of the many
mistaken acts which are notorious through the world is this :
like two or three other grandees whose names need not be
mentioned here, and who delighted in the praise of mean
people and their own servants for their alleged practical
ability and honesty,—he too remained satisfied with such a
[false] reputation. At last the whole thing was exposed.
During his naibship of the subah, his wicked sons, ruinous
hereditary acquaintances, roguish fagirs, nimble-handed
and glib, who enjoyed the confidence of this grandee, on
seeing him so negligent and inexperienced, misappropriated
the money of the Emperor and the Prince, and at last landed
him in the police lock-up (chabutra-i-kotwali), and then
they themselves quickly fled to their homes, leaving him to,

suffer. [404| In short, some virtuous nobles, like Mukhlis
Khan, Multafat Khan and ‘Inayetullah Khan, finally took
pity on him, came to his aid, and together spoke well of him
to the Emperor, so that he was released from confinement,
but did not look up again, till death came to him.

_ By order Khudabanda Khan went to guard the base,
and ‘Umdat-ul-mulk came to Court to perform the prayer
of ‘Id. On the day of ‘Id Kam Bakhsh rode on horseback
in the cortege of the Emperor. Peshkash was presented
to His Majesty (by many). Rewards and favours were con-
ferred (for the ‘Id). Buland Akhtar came to make the bow
of blessing for the ‘Id. Ruhullah Khan after transfer from
the darogha-ship of the diwan-i-khas, got an increment of
5-sad to his former rank of 24-hazdri. Hedaitullah Khan
presented nazar on the birth of a son. Mansur Khan darogha
of artillery of the Deccan, reported that his brother Muham-
mad Yusuf Khan qiladar of Qamrangar (Karnul) had sent
“as prisoner, a man who had given himself out in that neigh-
bourhood as the rebel Akbar. He was ordered to be made
over to Hamiduddin Khan.

On Thursday, the 20th April, 1699/29th Shawwal,
Kam Bakhsh went to a tent, pitched one chain (jarib) out-
side the gulalbar. On T uesday, the 16th May /26th Zil. Q.,
the messengers of Rana Amar Singh had audience : they
brought one elephant, two horses, nine swords, and nine
drawers of leather as peshkash. [405] Kamgar Khan and
Raja Man Singh son of Rup Singh (Rathor) were 2}-hazaris,
each got 500 more. ‘Abdur Rahim Khan, brother of Khan
Firuz Jang, a hazart, got 500 more. On Tuesday, the 30th
May, 1699 /10th Zil. H., Kam Bakhsh went to and returned
from the ‘Idgah before the arrival and return of the imperial
cortege. On Sunday, the 18th June/29th Zil. H., he made
his bow for being restored to his rank of 20-hazari. On
Saturday, the 24th June/16th Muharram, Chin Qalich
Khan Bahadur returned to Court after chastising the enemy
near Kota. The Emperor ordered Bakhshi-ul-mulk Mukhlis
Khan to advance to the gate of the fort of Islampuri to wel-
come him and to conduct him to his presence. By an incre-
ment of 500 (200 tr.) he was made 3}-hazari (3,000 tr.). On
Monday, the 10th July/22nd Muharram, Muhammad
Ibrahim, son of Najabat Khan deceased, who had the title
of Khan-i-‘Alam, after being released from prison, was
restored to the rank of 3-hazari (2-hazar tr.) and appointed
faujdar of Jaunpur. Indra Singh and Bahadur Singh, sons


--- Page 258 ---
1699 | EMPEROR IN ISLAMPURI CAMP 247

of Rana Raj Singh, were made 2-hazari (1,000 tr.) and a
hazari (500 tr.) respectively. Muhammad Amin Khan
reported to the Emperor from the letter of Firuz Jang Khan
that the zamindar of Islamgarh, on being defeated by the
imperial forces had fled and that Islamgarh had been cap-
tured. A bogus Buland Akhtar, the son of Shuja‘ who had
appeared near Allahabad, was captured and conveyed ‘to
Gwalior by a mace-bearer, who brought a receipt under the
seal of the qiladar. A cup of mariyam stone* [406] sent by
Shuja‘et Khan to Multafat Khan was shown to the Emperor.
As it was dappled, the Emperor liked it. The Khan was
ordered to write to Shuja‘et Khan to make vessels like the
cup and tray and send them to the Emperor.
The Khan made and sent extremely nice vessels with some
additional things, vic., throne, cistern and bedstead of one
piece and many carpet-stones of exquisite fashion and size.
They were accepted by the Emperor. Wahid Khan, grand-
son of the famous Chagtai, became thanadar of Ghorband;
he was a 3-sadi (same tr.). Satva Daflé,+ who had come to
Court, fled from the army through the deception of the
dragon of ill-luck. Tarbiyat Khan Mir Atish, Sayyid Khan,
Shukrullah Khan Kashghari and others were sent to pursue
and punish him. Haji Khanam, sister of Khan Jahan
Bahadur, came from Delhi to Court after her brother’s death
and received jewels worth 5,000 rupees, a half-sleeve, a
do-shala and 2,000 rupees in cash. Nasrat Khan son of
Khan Jahan Bahadur, a 9-sadi (500 tr.) got 100 more, while
his youngest son Abul Fath Khan, a 7-sadi (300 tr.) got
8-sadi (100 tr.) more. Ziaullah, son of ‘Inayetullah Khan
presented suitable peshkash on the birth of a son. Mukhlis
Khan conducted to the Presence Muhammad Taqi, the chief.
of the merchants of Persia; he presented 2 Quran, a Ghori
langar, 27 taqa of gold-embroidered cloth, and ‘atr of fitna.
Ruhullah Khan became darogha of the imperial retinue vice
Zulfiqar Khan Bahadur [407] and Siddat Khan that of
‘arz-i-mukarrar vice ‘Abdur Rahman Khan. He was a
hazaéri (200 tr.), and now got 500 more. Saf Shikan Khan
became agent of the Crown Prince. The Emperor ordered

* Stones used as weights to keep carpets stretched; usually placed on
the corners. .
+Satva Daflé—He was Satvaji Rao Daflé, the father of Baji Rao Chavan
Dafle. The latter was mortally wounded in trying to storm the breach at the
siege of Satara, and the jagir of Jath, W. of Bajapur, was given to the family
in reward. The father was the jagirdar. The family entered Bijapur service
about 1672. (Letter from the present chief of Jath to me, 6-8-1916.) Satva
Dafié is frequently mentioned in Akhbarat, ann. 43, 48.

that Sarup Singh, son of Anup Singh, should bring the
dependants of Raja Rama from Zulfigar Khan Bahadur to
the Court; and that the dependants of Shiva who were in
the misl of the ‘Umdat-ul-mulk, should be brought by
Hamiduddin Khan from that place and kept near Raja
Shahu in the gulalbar. Hifzullah Khan, son of S‘adullah
Khan, Subahdar of Tatta and faujdar of Siwistan, got an
increment of 300 to his rank of 2-hazari (700 tr. ), at the
request of Muizzuddin. Hamiduddin Khan Bahadur a
2-hazari (1,400 tr.), got 100 tr. in addition. Shaikh
S‘adullah was removed from the mushrifi of the khawa4ses.
I got that post in addition to my former one. Nasrat Jang
Khan had audience, and received a robe, a horse, an
elephant, and a jewelled dagger.

EMPEROR’S MARCH TO CAPTURE THE FORTS OF THE
INFIDELS : ~

Conquest of Vasantgarh alias Kilid-i-fath :

[408] The Emperor after four years’ stay at Islim-
puri, * * * wished to set out on expedition in person and to
trample under the hoofs of his horse the land and forts of
the infernal infidels. He ordered that a cutcha wall (lit.
fort) with a circuit of two and a half kos should be built
around the small fortalice of stone and plaster which had
been constructed a year earlier to enclose the Emperor’s
quarters. This work was finished in fifteen days. Zinat-
un-nisa Begam, the mother of the Prince, (i.e., Udipuri),
and other ladies of the harem, and the families of all
(common) people were left in this safe base under the care of
‘Umdat-ul-mulk Madar-ul-maham Asad Khan with a suit-
able force.

On Thursday, the 19th October, 1699/5th Jamad. A.,
the Emperor started at an auspicious moment. [409] I can-
not record the marches and places of alighting at all the
stages (of his journey). In short, he reached the outskirts
of Murtazabad Miraj in twenty days. Prince Muhammad
‘Azam, who had been summoned to the Emperor from Ped-
gaon, had audience here, and received various favours, a
special robe, a jewelled dhakdhaki, and a horse with
enamelled saz. As true news was received that Raja Rama
had gone towards Berar, Bidar Bakht was ordered to leave
his camp at Murtazabad and hasten in pursuit of him.

1699]. FORT VASANTGARH CAPTURED, 249

Ruhullah Khan was given a robe and a sword and Hamid-
uddin Khan Bahadur a robe and a katar and ordered to
ravage the tract between Parnalagarh and Sataragarh, leav-
ing not the name or vestige of habitation. On the way,
when the imperial camp reached the neighbourhood of the
parganah of Karad the Emperor learnt that an imperial out-
post (thanah) once stood here, but the enemy had ruined it,
and that a mosque built here in former times was without
a lamp. The Emperor marched two kos in that direction
and [410] said two-fold prayers in the mosque and issued
an order to populate the place and restore the thanah. The
runaway ryots being reassured with promises of safety and
reward, resumed their residence there. A party was
appointed to guard them. From this place the Emperor
went to a thanah named Masur, where a body of Islamic
troops were staying. Opposite it, at a distance of three kos
on the top of a strongly fortified hill was a firmly-built fort
named Vasantgarh, belonging to the enemy and famous for
its strength. * * *

The Emperor ordered Tarbiyat Khan Mir Atish to
ascend the hill and fight the devils. The Khan did in two
days the work of two years, carried the artillery-men under
the gate of the fort, and placing guns opposite to it, got
ready for destroying the enemy, who did not abstain from
cannonade and showering fire. On learning of it the
Emperor ordered his tent to be pitched on the bank of the
Krishna, which flows at the foot of the fort at a distance of
one kos, and said, ‘‘My object in this journey is nothing
except holy war (ghaza), so please God and His Prophet.
Next morning I shall mount my horse to conduct the assault,
and raise my banner to slay the infidels’’. [411] On seeing
the tent set up so near and hearing of the Emperor’s deter-
mination, the enemy lost heart. * * * They cried quarters
that very day, and wanted only to escape with their honour
(family). As the Emperor is the protector of the weak, he
graciously ordered that the garrison should be allowed to
go out without their arms, instead of being put to the sword.
At night the enemy got their opportunity of evacuating the
fort, and next morning, Saturday, the 25th November,
1699 /12th Jamad. S., the fort was conquered and renamed
Kilid-i-fath. Much buried treasure, provisions, and
weapons were seized by the imperialists in the fort.

On Friday, the 17th November /4th Jamad. S., the
Emperor learnt that Bidar Bakht had had a severe fight with.

Rama on the further side of the Nira. Khan-i-‘Alam and
Sarafraz Khan had distinguished themselves and the enemy
had fled leaving his camp and baggage behind. The Shah-
zada and other [412] good warriors had rewards sent to
them. Khan Bahadur Nasrat Jang was ordered to serve
under the Shahzada and punish the vanquished Rama
[Rajaram] wherever he might raise his head.

Two servants of Muhammad Akbar from Qandahar
brought to the Court a letter begging forgiveness and a
casket of ‘attar. A robe and a farman,—stating that so long
as he did not come within the frontiers of India he would
not be pardoned, but that on his entering the imperial domi-
nions a gracious order appointing him Subahdar of Bengal
and conferring other favours would be issued to him,—were
sent to Akbar with these men.

Amanat Khan mutasaddi of the port of Surat, died ; his
elder brother Dianat Khan succeeded him. Saifuddin Khan
Safavi became qiladar of Sholapur. Lutfullah Khan became
Subahdar of Bijapur ; he was a 24-hazari (1,400 tr.) and now
got 500 zat (600 tr.) more.

CAPTURE OF SATARA.

[413] * * * On Friday, the 8th December, 1699 /25th
Jamad. S., the imperial tent was pitched at the foot of the
fort, at a distance of half a kos. On the other side was placed
the camp of ‘Azam Shah. The army surrounded the
environs of the fort. By order, Tarbiyat Khan Mir Atish
began to run trenches. In a few days the heroes reached
the waist (of the hill) and carried heavy guns [414] up. A
terrible fire was directed upon the fort. But what looked
like the wall of the fort was entirely rock, thirty yards high,
and above it had been placed sixty yards of muzawwar and
sangchin (loose stones); there was no wall which could be
shaken (by bombardment). As Satara was the refuge and
abode of the hellish infidel Rama [Rajaram], it was full of
all the materials of strength, such as artillery, provisions,
abundance of water from fountains which flowed even in
summer, and soldiers of skill and desperate courage. Day
and night, rockets, muskets, huqqga, chadar, mashk and
matwala were fired incessantly (from the fert). The count-
less force of the enemy outside the fort fell on the provisions
and burnt the grass, the means of life of the cattle, for twenty
miles round. On some occasions they boldly approached

the camp but were put to flight. Scarcity of grain and fodder
reached the extreme point. Those who looked at the external
aspect of things thought the conquest of the fort an impos-
sibility. The Emperor relying on the Helper of jihad-
fighters in the path of Allah, remained as firm and courage-
ous as ever to vanquish the infidels, till at last, 18 zir‘a from
the door of the fort a raised battery was erected opposite the
tower ; in procuring materials for it not a tree was left within
thirty or forty kos. From the side of the Prince, too, all
the trenches were run to the foot of the fort. It was ordered
that miners should run mines under the foundations of the
fort. [415] Within a few days twenty-four yards of hard
stony soil were excavated from the neighbourhood of the
same raised battery. With these men (the miners) were
present, according to command, two thousand MAvlé infantry
who were very expert in capturing forts. One lakh and
thirty thousand rupees, the salary of three years, was paid
in advance to these men. And materials for scaling the fort,
such as, ladders with steps, rope-ladders (mal), and leather
covers (ja@mah) were provided. * * *

And as in the opinion of the chiefs the mere assembling
of these materials was not likely to result in the capture of
the fort, Tarbiyat Khan made a portable ladder from the
foot of the same raised battery, which (battery) was
twenty four yards in height. For the materials of this ladder
he used up a thousand camel-litters and bags of sack-cloth
and (even) fine linen—the last of which was so scarce that
less than four yards of it could be had for a rupee—and all
the firewood of the plain around. After making a glacis,
he carried the mie to the foot of the fort, and planted the
wooden ladders above it. But the business did not prosper
“beyond this that the Khan had mounted rahkalas (small
cannon) on the former raised platform (damdama) and the
garrison could not show their heads above the fort-wall or
fire muskets but had to sit down in hidine behind the wall
and throw stones. The plan of storming the walls was not
likely to succeed. The Emperor ordered that under the
leadership of Ruhullah Khan, Fathullah Khan should run
another trench from the side of the gate of the fort. On
Friday, the 15th March, 1700/5th Shawwal,.the Khan
boldly following the right plans (416) carried the trench
under the rewni (fausse-braye) of the fort in one month. Tar-
biyat Khan, in order to remedy the:weakness in planning he
had shown in the work of forming ladders, excavated 9

recess in the sangchin of the fort, and. made a cavity four
yards on one side and ten yards on the other in the length of
the wall. There was only a thin screen between the garrison
and the heroes who kept watch in this recess. But from
neither side did any body dare to cross this zir‘a of land.
It was decided to fill the whole cavity with gunpowder and
overthrow the wall, in order to open a path for the easy
entrance of the storming party. The Emperor ordered that
in addition to the cavalry, infantry, artillery, khaschauki,
Afghan and Ghakkar clansmen, other troops, and Kar-
natakis, who were present there day and night, Bakhshi-ul-
mulk Mukhlis Khan and Hamiduddin Khan Bahadur
should go with some thousand troopers and wait for the
opportunity so that, when after the explosion of the mine,
the forlorn hope* would enter the fort, they might reinforce
them. On Saturday, the morning of ‘13th April, 1700/5th
Zil. Q., at first a fuse was fired, the fort-wall fell inside and
a large ‘body of the garrison were burnt. In the expectation
that this wall too would be thrown down inside, no warning
was sent to the storming party to run back, but the (second)
match was fired. The wall fell on the Mughal side, hills
of stone and clay were showered on the thousands of men
‘ready for the movement; those who had hidden themselves
in mud-holes in wait for the opportunity (to storm), found
ready graves there. [417] Many were flung into the nadir
which resembled the coffin of (their) destruction, and their
limbs were scattered. In short, nearly two thousand brave
soldiers perished. Although a wide path for men opened
of itself (in the wall) and some infantry ran to the top of
the wall and cried ‘‘Come on! there is none here’’, yet so
overcome were the men of the trenches by fear that none
advanced. The plan was upset. What was done produced
no better result than if it had not been done; so that, when
after a few hours, the opportunity passed away and the enemy
saw that none appeared on that side, they mounted the wall
and made the hot place hotter still, occupied it firmly, and
began to fire their muskets. As the damdama too had been
thrown down, the rahkalas had fallen down, and the soldiers
withdrew their hands from their work, who could encounter
the enemy? At this time the Emperor boldly supported
them from behind, so that they began to enter the fort over
heaps of the slain. Yes, \ without the leader works fall into

.* This was Baji, Chivay Daf, _ ancestor of the chief of Jath fin the

confusion ; without the commander the hearts of heroes be-
come as limbs without the head ; even if the soldiers are one
lakh, in the absence of that single individual (the leader),
they do not amount to one, and if he alone enters the field
he does not need the aid of this lakh of men. There is no
doubt about it. (Verse) * * *

418] This was the reason: the Emperor had in his
foresight ordered a tent to be pitched in the waist of the hill,
in order to go there personally with the Prince and himself
conduct the operations. As Providence wished to further
His own design, all the ministers joined together in dis-
suading His Majesty by entreaty. This day, too, the
imperial cortege was kept ready to start, but after the work
had been thrown into confusion what would be the good of
his going there? —The Emperor * * * repeatedly said, ‘‘How
excellent would it have been if I had been with them and
had thus accomplished a great success!’ He sent cheering
messages to the demoralised troops urging them to be firm,
‘‘Why are you overcome by mere imagination and agitation
of mind? The enemy have not triumphed over you. Only
your plan has miscarried. Well, if a roof falls down, do not
a body of men perish in the sleep of negligence?’’ That
very day Sarfaraz Khan, Manaji, and the troops of Bakhshi-
ul-mulk Bahramand Khan were ordered to go and hold the
trenches in company with Tarbiyat Khan. The relatives
of some of the buried persons, who could make their way to
the places where they were trapped, extracted the dead and
the wounded and carried them to their quarters. What was
more strange was that the bahlia infantry, saddened by
the sinking down of their brothers, sons ‘and friends, and
angry with the Mir Atish, [419] on seeing that it was
impossible to extract the dead from under the hill of stone
and clay—and as it was the rule of their bad religion to
burn the dead, secretly set fire that night to the entrench-
ments, which were entirely of wood. The fire burnt for
seven days and nights. Where was the water to quench this
wilderness of fire? Many Hindus and some Muslims that
could not be brought out, were burnt together.

This nobleman (Tarbiyat Khan), in the hope of bread
and fear of life, which all slaves of the Emperor have, had
made such exertions in conquering the fort as the imagina-
tion cannot picture. But ‘‘Men plan, God alone performs’’.
Holy: God.! the fortune of.the Emperor was such as in these
eighty-five years of his lifé wherever .he. turned. his. faced,

many remote objects and many high designs hastened to wel-
come him. On Tuesday, the 5th March 1700/25th Ramzan,
news came that Rama, [Rajaram] who had made a dash
towards Berar, had returned disappointed to his home and
gone to hell there. On Wednesday, the 20th March/10th
Shawwal, news came that his 5-year old son, whom his
chiefs had set up as their king, [420] had died too. On
seeing these divine aids and fearing extirpation, Parsuram,
the chief officer of the infidel’s household, came out of the
fort (Parli) seven kos from Satara, and got the Emperor’s
pardon through the mediation of Ruhullah Khan. Subhan,
the commandant of Satara, a prudent amd lucky man, on
seeing that other (Maratha leaders) were going to outstrip
him in offering submission, and serving their own ends, that
the fort wall on the side of the trenches of Tarbiyat Khan
had fallen down for seventy yards up to half the tower, that
‘many men had been destroyed by artillery fire, especially
the gun ‘Mulk-zabt’, which had been mounted on a hillock
behind the trenches of the Prince and commanded the fort,
was demolishing the houses in the fort, that 400 men had
been destroyed at the explosion of the mine, that Fathullah
Khan had run lofty entrenchments to the gate of the fort,
and was wishing to break the gate and demolish the wall
at one blow,—found no refuge left to him except begging the
Emperor’s forgiveness, and sent an envoy (midnji) to Prince
‘Azam Shah to beg for quarters. He, taking pity on the lives
of the thousands of men and women in the fort, interceded
with the Emperor who granted his request. [421] The order
of pardon was issued: the garrison were allowed to go in
safety out of the fort. On Sunday, the 21st April, 1700/
18th Zil. Q., our banners mounted the towers and parapets
of that fort of infidelity. * * *

As the fort was captured through the mediation of the
Prince, it was named ‘Azamtara. The next day, the Prince
brought Subhan with his hands and neck tied together to
the Emperor who ordered him to be unbound and enrolled
in the imperial service. He was given a mansab of 5-hazari
(2,000 tr.) a robe, a katadr, a horse, an elephant, a tugh, a
standard, kettledrums, and 20,000 rupees. * * *

i 22) The siege of the fort from its commencement on
8th December, 1699/25th Jamad. S., to its conclusion on
21st April 1700 /18th Zil. Q., occupied four months and
eighteen days. I shall now narrate briefly:the other events
that happened during this perjod.

S., four hundred dshrafis sent by ‘Umdat-ul-mulk from the
base as peshkash for the conquest of Kilid-i-fath, were
presented to the Emperor.- Bakhshi-ul-mulk Mukhlis Khan
by command conveyed Kam Bakhsh to Shah ‘Alijah; and
at the Shah’s request it was ordered that at the time of
holding Court Kam Bakhsh too should come. Shaikh Farid,
son of Hamid Khan got the title of Khan. On Tuesday, the
26th December/14th Rajab, Bidar Bakht, returning from
the punishment of Rama, [Rajaram] had audience. Nasrat
Jang had audience and received many favours. On Saturday,
the 6th January, 1700/25th Rajab, Ikhlas Khan, who had
the title of Ihtamam Khan went out for patrolling, when
the enemy appeared one mile from the imperial camp; a
severe battle was fought; he was slain with his son and a
son of Najabat Khan deceased, and many soldiers were slain
or wounded. The post of the deceased [423] was given to
Hamiduddin Khan, who got a special robe with a jewelled
waist-muttaka. The Emperor learnt that Muhammad Amin
Khan was having an encounter with the enemy one and a
half kos from the camp, and that if he got reinforcement he
might vanquish the rebels. Hamiduddin Khan Bahadur
was ordered to go to his aid. Bakhshi-ul-mulk Bahramand
Khan and Hamiduddin Khan Bahadur who had gone to-
wards Khatav to bring in provisions, beat and drove away
the enemy wherever he appeared, and conveyed large
supplies to the imperial camp. After interview they were
praised. Bahramand Khan got an emerald muttaka and
Hamiduddin Khan a sarpech. Ramchand, thanadar of
Khatav, was promoted to be a 2-hazari (8,000 tr.). On
Wednesday, the 31st January, 1700/20th Shaban, the
Crown Prince was made Subahdar of Lahore vice Ibrahim
Khan ; a sword, a dagger, a shield, a quiver and a bow-case
were presented to Buland Akhtar. He made his bow in the
private chamber.

[424] Fazil Khan, Subahdar of Kashmir, was ordered
to administer the Panjab as the deputy of the Crown Prince.
He was a 24-hazari (1,200 tr.) and now got an increment of
500 (200 tr.). Vijay Singh, zamindar (bumi) of Amber,
got the title of Raja Jai Singh on the death of his father,
and his brother (Jamuna) got the title of Vijay Singh. He
was a hazari (800 tr.) and now got an increment of 500
(1,200 tr.). Chin Qalich Khan Bahadur was restored the
500 zat deducted from his rank, and became a 4-hazari
(8-hazar tr.). Chhatra Sal Bundela [cor. Rathor] became
qiladar of ‘Azamtara. On Monday, the 22nd April, 1700/
14th Zil. Q., the Emperor visited the fort, and performed
the two-fold prayer of thanks in the old mosque, built by
the Bahamani kings, which was white-washed at His
Majesty’s command.

CAPTURE OF FORT PARLI:

When the Emperor [425] had finished the conquest of
Azamtara and had appointed its qiladar and faujdar, he
wanted to conquer Parli-garh. He ordered Fathullah Khan
to go in advance and besiege the fort. The Khan reached
the fort that very day and decided to run trenches directed
towards the tower under which was a small door of the fort.
The imperial officers quickly conveyed the siege materials
collected at Satara to the foot of Parli. On Tuesday, the
30th April /22nd Zil. Q., the Emperor having traversed the
intervening space in three days, encamped on the plain in
front of the fort-gate. The Prince’s camp was located before
the imperial mansion. Ruhullah Khan became mir murchal.
Chin Qalich Khan Bahadur and the soldiers of the Prince,
and other forces of the army surrounded the hill of the fort
on all sides forming a circuit of a few kos. Parli is even
stronger than Satara. In short, the Khan without heeding
its strength, worked hard to run trenches and to mount guns

on-a hillock commanding the fort, doing the work of years
in as many days. But what shall I write about the excess
[426] of rain and scarcity of grain and fodder? * * * The
dark clouds showered day and night like the eyes of orphans.
Houses were submerged. * * * In short, owing to the flood
of the rivers and the non-arrival of provisions from all sides,
famine became severe. I wonder at the firmness and
strength of the Emperor who, without being alarmed by it,
encouraged and consoled the soldiers. At last the Khan
carried the trench under a very broad and long sloping rock,
which on one side fifteen yards high and on another ten
yards high, was situated opposite the small door. It was
very difficult to mount this rock, but if it could be captured
the conquest of the fort would be easy. On Tuesday, the
4th June, 1700/27th Zil. H., a few ladders were placed on
the side which was ten yards high, and the heroes were
ordered to escalade so that the enemy would assemble to
oppose them. Then the Khan mounted the rock by means
of another ladder secretly planted [elsewhere], with a body
of heroes, and brought under their swords the enemy in
the plain which extended up to the small door of the fort,
and afforded ground for horse-riding. The infidels unable
to resist ran to the door and the Mughals arrived there
speedily. As it was not [427] the Khan’s intention to enter
the fort, he wished to mount the rock, station his men on
it, and mounting a gun on it break the door. At this time
he himself went down to send up bundles of wood and straw
to make a refuge for the soldiers (on the rock). In the course
of the fight three or four Mughals and one Bahalia entered
the small door pell-mell with the infidels; others too wanted
to do the same, when suddenly a Mughal was shot down,
and the Bahalia losing heart, fled away in such a way as to
mingle himself with others in flight. Seizing the oppor-
tunity the enemy closed the door, and began to fire muskets
and throw huqqas from the top of the wall, and set fire to
the gunpowder which, in anticipation of such a day they
had hidden underground on the way leading to the fort.
Faqirullah Khan, grandson of Fathullah Khan and sixty
or seventy other men were killed, and many were wounded.
The rest who could not maintain their stand on the top of
the rock for its lack of shelter as it was exposed to deadly
attack on all three sides, descended and took up their old
position. But this feat struck terror into the hearts of the
infidels. Next morning they permitted the two men who

33


--- Page 269 ---
258 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI [cH. 44

had entered the fort with them to go out by the gate towards
the imperial army, and crying quarters besought the Prince
for safety. As the Emperor had based the work of conquest
on the counsel of the Prince and he always accepted the
Prince’s suggestions, according to the Emperor’s order the
Prince’s men sent the garrison out of the fort on Sunday,
the 9th June/3rd Muharram, [428] without their weapons,
property and wealth. This seat of Islam, which through the
tricks of the hellish Shiva had gone out of the possession
of the Bijapuris and been ‘turned into a seat of war (dar-ul-
harb) verified the verse ‘“Truth came and falsehood dis-
appeared’. The old mosque was filled again and the new
temple was destroyed ; this fort had been built by Ibrahim
‘Adil Khan in 1625 A.D./1085 A.H. and as he used to
give the name of Nauras to all newly-made things, (such
as the title of the book of Mulla Zahuri, the name of the city
of Nauras-i-Ibrahim, and the name of the dam or coin
Nauras,) it was now named Nauras-tara. * * *

MARCH OF THE IMPERIAL ARMY TOWARDS
BHUSANGARH :

After the capture of Nauras-tara, the Emperor wished
to march towards Bhusangarh. Although getting out of
such a bad place was regarded by high and low in the army
as a great boon, yet owing to material and celestial cala-
mities there was no beast of burden left in the wide camp.
* * * The soldiers considered it a great comfort to stay
there, [429] and could not march under the load of fatigue.
But the Emperor is the custodian of the comfort of his people
and if he-had not wished it, none could have come out of that
dangerous place.

The return march commenced on Friday, the 21st
June, 1700/15th Muharram. The gypsies willy nilly, had
to load their household goods on cocks. One march was
followed by two halts, in order to enable the men mounted
on pack-saddles devoid of baggage to arrive by any means
they could find. Many of the army passed over five kos in
three stages, and reached the Krishna which was in such a
high flood that the banks could not be seen. The army
finished the crossing in a few days, and with great difficulty
réached Sabitgarh and the neighbouring villages. On
Thursday, the 25th July /19th Safar the camp arrived near

1700] EMPEROR’S CAMP AT KHAWASPUR FLOODED 259

Bhusangarh. The rains went back to their houses. The
army regained peace of mind. The violence of the rivers
and nullahs ceased. The people got safety and comfort.
The Prince was ordered to go to Khandesh, the land of repose
and stay at Burhanpur, in order to refresh his troops. And
the war-worn soldiers were sent to various flourishing places
in the old dominion. Orders were sent to the provincial
governors to send fresh troops to the Emperor. Prince
Bidar Bakht, who with his own troops, [480] had been
guarding the base, was summoned to the Presence. After
interview he was deputed to conquer fort Parnala. In addi-
tion to his own troops, Zulfiqar Khan Bahadur Nasrat Jang
was appointed to serve under him; and after some time
Tarbiyat Khan, Mir Atish, too. As the Emperor’s sole
wish was to give ease to the people, -he decided to make
Khawaspur, which was about one dav’s journey, his base,
so that the soldiers accompanying him might enjoy repose
during his stay there. On Friday, the 30th August, 1700/
26th Rabi. A., the army started for the place, and on the
arrival there the soldiers really gained ease through the
comparative abundance of grain, fodder and most other
necessaries, * * *

In a waterless river, the name of whose bed (qalb) is
‘the mirage of abundant water’’, and on both banks and.
middle of which many commanders and soldiers of the right
and front (divisions) [431] had pitched their tents, never
dreaming that up to the day of Resurrection, a drop of water
would descend on it except in the rainy season, the verse
‘‘The oven spouted forth water’’ at Noah’s deluge came to
be proved true. ‘ On the night of Tuesday, the Ist October,
1700/28th Rabi. S., there was rain in the heights, the
hill streams set their faces towards it. While the men were
fast asleep in their tents, all on a sudden the water came
down raging from both banks and spread over the plain,
turning the land into water. The tents were ruined. Vast
numbers of men and animals were drowned. ‘The rest
became prisoners of water. If the remaining period had
been night and the flood had continued longer than four or
five gharis of day, no one would have remained alive. By
the grace of God the dawn appeared; the men saved their
lives. They sought for the traces of their houses and found
none. Giving up all hopes of their property they went
crying in all directions. In some misls which had been -
located on distant and high hillocks, no news arrived of


--- Page 271 ---
260 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI [ou. 44

what happened (in the river). Praised be God that no harm
befell the imperial tent which was pitched very high. * * *

As I have not yet recorded certain incidents from the
beginning of the 44th year [482], I shall now narrate them
to the end of the Sh‘aban (last month) of that year, it being
necessary for the historian of events to preserve the chain
of narrative.

Zulfiqgar Khan Bahadur Nasrat Jang, who had been
ordered to punish Dhana Jadav returned to Court, after
crushing him. He and his companions Daud Khan, Dalpat,
Ram Singh, and others, got praise, robes, jewels, and pro-
motion. Prince Muhammad Mu ‘izzuddin, Subahdar of
Multan, was rewarded for having wrested the fort of
Dhaohar from the -possession of the zamindar of Dogra,
with an increment of 2-hazar tr. making him a 12-hazari
(6,000 tr. dodspa). Prince Muhammad ‘Azim, Subahdar
of Bengal, got the hazar tr. that had been reduced from his
rank. Hifzullah Khan Subahdar of Tatta, a 2-hazari,
(same tr.) got 500 more at the Shahzada’s request. Fazil
Khan Subahdar of Kashmir, who had declined to act as
deptty Subahdar of Lahore, and applied for permission to
come to Court, had the 200 tr. which had been given him
on condition of being deputy, taken away from his mansab,
and his application was granted. On the way, he died at
Burhanpur. He was an upright, honoured, and faithful
man, ‘Inayetullah Khan was ordered to give! jagir for
8,000 tr. to Kam Bakhsh in tankhwa and not to insist on
a new memorandum (yad-dasht), Khudabanda Khan
bayutat, became Subahdar of Muhammadabad vice ‘Askar
Khan, with an increment of 500 (same tr.); Fazail Khan,
mir munshi, darogha of the library, [433] became bayutat
vice him. ‘Inayetullah Khan became diwan of Bidar Bakht
Bahadur. The Emperor learnt that Hindus did not take
(cooked) food during imprisonment, and hence Raja Shahu,
son of Sambha, used to eat sweet-meats, fruits, and
pakwan, instead of (cooked) food. Hamiduddin Khan
conveyed to him this message, ‘‘You are not a prisoner ;
you are living in your own house. You should eat cooked
food.’’ Zinat-un-nisa Begam who had been summoned
from the base, arrived on Saturday, the 12th October,
1700/10th Jamad. A., mounted on a chaudol. Kam
Bakhsh and Buland Akhtar welcomed her by advancing.
Fidai Khan, Subahdar of Bihar, got the faujdari of Tirhut

1700] NOBLE PERSIAN EMIGRES 261.

and Darbhanga. He was a 2%-hazari (same tr.) and now
got an increment of 500 zat unconditionally. When the
affairs of the country fell into confusion on the death of
Bulbaris Khan, king of Kashghar, the Emperor ordered
Arslan Khan, son of Shah Khan and grand-son of the late
king’s uncle, who was in the imperial service, to go home
and take possession of the kingdom. Sardar Khan of the
Crown Prince’s army, was permitted to help him.
Sadruddin Muhammad Khan became Subahdar of Khandesh
vice Mu‘atagad Khan, and was made a 2-hazari (same tr.)
by an increment of 500 troopers [484].

EMPEROR’S MARCH TO CAPTURE PARNALA

On Monday, the 16th December, 1700/16th Rajab,
His Majesty marched towards Murtazabad Miraj, arriving
there on Wednesday, the Ist January, 1701/2nd Shaban.
Bakhshi-ul-mulk Mukhlis Khan, son of Saf Shikan Khan,
grandson of that Qawamuddin Khan who had been Sadr of
Persia, and brother’s son of the renowned Khalifa Sultan,
died of severe illness on Saturday, the 3rd January, 1701 /
4th Sh‘aban and was buried in the tomb-garden (rauza) of.
the saint Sayyid Shamsuddin, situated in the new city
(Miraj). He combined nobility of birth with perfection in
the discharge of his profession. Independence of earthly
needs and freedom of spirit were natural to him. .The
Emperor uSed often to say about him, ‘‘I have a young
Khalifa Sultan with me’’. Ruhullah Khan became second
bakhshi vice the deceased, and was succeeded by Saf Shikan
Khan in the posts of Qurbegi and bakhshi of the 4hadis.

CHAPTER XLV. -
45TH YEAR OF THE REIGN :
29th January, 1701—18th January, 1702.

The Emperor stayed at Miraj during the month of
Ramzan. When it was over, on Sunday, the 2nd March,
1701/3rd Shawwal, he started for the conquest of Parnala
and Pawangarh, close to it, a very lofty fort nowise inferior
to Parnala in strength. On Saturday, the 9th March /10th
Shawwal, the imperial camp was pitched in the environs of
the fort, at a place (facing) the door of the fort, on the bank
of the river that flows under the fort within gunshot. [485 |
That day I took omens in the poetical works of His Holiness
Hafiz concerning the conquest of the fort, and my eyes fell
on the following couplet :

The heart which has the invisible world in sight
possesses the cup of Jamshid,
Why be anxious about a ring which gets lost for a,
moment ?

In truth, this ring of auspicious inscription (i.¢.,
Parnala) had often been taken possession of by Muhammadan
kings. Shiva wrested it from the ‘Adil-khani kings.
Afterwards, when the whole country of the Deccan was
cleansed of the filth of infidel dominion, it was captured by
the imperialists through the exertions of Muhammad
‘Azam. ‘Then Sambha recovered possession of it through
some of its defenders conducting themselves like infidels
and the negligence and cowardice of its qgiladar. Thank
God, it now again came into the hands of the Muslims.
In short, Nasrat Jang Khan, was sent to punish the rebel
.‘thieves’ on whichever side they might raise their heads.
Shahzada Wald-tabar and other forces having come, some
of the troops accompanying the Emperor were ordered to
pitch their tents on the other side of the fort. The army
surrounded the circuit of both the forts, seven kos in extent.
Under the supervision of Tarbiyat Khan trenches were
ryn, and guns [436] began to play on the enemy. In a short
time five towers of the fort were demolished down to more


--- Page 274 ---
1701] SIEGE OF PANHALA 263

than half their height. This commander exerted himself
marvellously in breaking the stony soil and running up
lanes (tunnels) into the hilly region. Having excavated a
distance of some jarib (land-measuring rope) under the
ground, he made a path, through which three fully armed
men could walk abreast at their full height. At a distance of
some paces a chamber was made large enough to seat twenty
soldiers. On all sides of it windows were made for the
wind to blow and the sun to shine in. He stationed his
artillerymen in this house to prevent with their muskets
the enemy from showing their heads above the wall. This
lane was carried under the tower on which the guns were
playing, and its base was hollowed out so much that a party
of heroes kept watch in it without being touched by the
huqqa and matwala of the enemy. And at last he led this
lane inside the fort by carrying it under the outer breast-
work of the gate. But as delay occurred in the progress of
the work, the rainy season was close at hand, and this
country on account of its bad weather in the rains, the
intervention of some rivers difficult to cross, and the
difficulty of bringing in supplies, was not fit for the encamp-
ment (chhauni) of the imperial army, the Emperor ordered
Fathullah Khan, who had gone to Aurangabad to refresh
his broken troops and had recently returned to the Presence,
[437] to run a second trench from the side of the troops
of the Emperor’s son, under the command of that Prince
[kam Bakhsh] and with the co-operation of Mun’im

han. The Khan, in one month, cut away the stony soil
of the high hill and carried the lane to the foot of the gate.
The garrison of both the forts fought (for a long time).
But when they saw the running of lanes, and the skill of
the musketeers, and apprehended that Tarbiyat Khan from
one side and Fathullah Khan from the other would destroy
the impregnability of their fort, that Muhammad Murad
Khan with his followers and Khwaja Muhammad, bakhshi
of the army of Kam Bakhsh wished to overthrow the
towers and battlements of Pawangarh, that the besieging
army had left to the garrison little. chance of flight, and
that it was the Emperor ‘Alamgir who never gave up his
purpose on account of rain or other accidents and these
were troops who never left their work undone, * * they saw
no recourse left to them but to submit and sent men
through the mediation of Tarbiyat-Khan [488] to the
Emperor’s son and the Shahzada to beg for quarters, These


--- Page 275 ---
264 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI [cx. 45

two gracious ones taking pity on the multitude of likely
victims recommended the prayer for mercy, which the
Emperor granted. Trimbak, the qiladir was permitted to
depart with his life and property. On the 28th May, 1701/
ist Muharram, the conquest was accomplished, and the
two forts annexed to the Empire. Parnala was so high
that Azamtara could not lift its head above the wall of
he former. * * * [489] Parnala was renamed Nabishah
urg.

I shall now narrate certain former and synchronous
events of this year. Sher Zaman Khan, qiladar of Kabul,
became naib Subahdar vice Nasir Khan, who was punished

~by reduction of his rank by 500 zat (600 tr.); Sadruddin

Muhammad Khan Safavi, got the tittle of Mirza. The
Emperor learnt that Ghaziuddin Khan Bahadur Firuz Jang
had arrived by command to guard the base. Chin Qalich
Khan Bahadur, son of Firuz Jang, having left his father
on account ofill-feeling, by command went to Aurangabad.
Jan Sipaér Khan, son of Mukhtar Khan, nazim of
Haidarabad died; the subadarship was entrusted to the
agents of Kam Bakhsh. Rustam-dil Khan, son of the
deceased, (Jan Sipar Khan) became naib (Subahdar) and
received an addition of 500 zat (same tr.) to his rank of
hazari (500 tr.). Bulbaris Khan became guardian of the
base at Murtazabad, and received an addition of 500 zat
(100 tr.) to his rank of 1%%-hazari (500 tr.). Daud Khan
became faujdar of Karnatak Haidaribadi (Bijapuri) as
deputy of Nasrat Jang.

_ As the Emperor could not ride out to perform the two
prayers of ‘Id-ul-fitr (28th February, 1701) owing to the
violence of his catarrh (nazlah), [440] Kam Bakhsh with
his sons and Buland Akhtar, made the bows of congratula-
tion (for the ‘Id) to the Emperor, who ordered that instead
of the name of nazar that of nidz should be applied to the
presents made by the Princes, and that of nisar to those of
the 4mirs. Qutbuddin, envoy of Turan, who had received
his congee, begged the Crown Prince on reaching Kabul
to admit him into the imperial service ; he was given the rank
of a hazari (200 tr.).

On Friday, the 18th April, 1701/2lst Zil. Q., the
lightning struck the courtyard of the diwan-i-khas;.a kahar
of.the abdér-khana was hit by it and killed but the other

men remained safe. The Princes, Sultans, and amirs of
the Court and the provinces sent money for tasaddugq to the
Emperor. Hifzullah Khan, son of the late S‘adullah Khan,
Subahdar of Tatta, died. Among the sons of the Khan he
was not without ability. Khanahzad Khan, son of S‘aid
Khan Bahadur Shah-Jahani, was appointed Subahdar of
Tatta and faujdar of Siwistan, at the request of Mu‘izzuddin.
He was a 2-hazari (100 tr.) and now got an increment of
500 (700 tr.) and the title of S‘aid Khan. Multafat Khan
got the title of Khanahzad Khan. Ism‘ail Khan Makha
became faujdar of Nabishahdurg. He was a 5-hazari (4000
tr.) and now got 1000 tr. more. Muhatsham Khan son of
Shaikh Mir, had been appointed a 2-hazari zat, he got back a
hazar tr. which had been reduced. Hamidudddin Khan
Bahadur got [441] a robe and waist-muttaka, Tarbiyat
Khan Mir Atish a robe and sarpech. Khairandesh Khan
Kambuh faujdar of Etawah, got seven lakhs of dam as
in‘am and the faujdari of Dhamuni also. Chin Qalich Khan
Bahadur became faujdar of Karnatak Bijapuri vice M‘amur
Khan; a 4-hazari (3,000 tr.) before, he now got an incre-
ment of 600 tr.

News came to the’ Emperor from the subah of
Ahmadabad that Shuja‘et Khan Muhammad Beg, the
nazim, had died on the 16th June, 1701/20th Muharram.
He was a wonderfully fortunate man, as he rose from a
low position to the dignity of an amir. He was an upright
and efficient officer, an able general and administrator,
never committing any blunder, and possessing many noble
qualities.* Arshad Khan, diwan of Khalsa, died.

‘INAYETULLAH KHAN BECAME DIWAN OF TAN AND KHALSA.

‘Inayetullah Khan, in addition to his post of diwan of
tan, got the post of diwan of Khalsa vice the deceased. He
was a 1'%-hazari (150 tr.), and now got 100 tr. more.
‘Umdat-ul-mulk Asad Khan, who had been summoned from
the base to the imperial army, had audience on Thursday,
the 28th August /4th Rabi. S., Lutfullah Khan was trans-
ferred from the subahdari of Bijapur to that of Aurangabad
and by an increment of 500 tr. became a 3-haziri (2,500 tr.)

*The MS. here adds the following words which have been omitted in
the printed text :—‘‘The people of the subah acknowledge his miracle-working
power and read the fatiha on his tomb.” For an account of this officer’s
able administration, see Sarkar’s History of Aurangzib, V. Ch. 58, Sec. 3-7,

266. MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI [cxH. 45

Abu Nasar Khan [442] son of Shaista Khan was restored
to his rank of 21%-hazari (1000 tr.) and got the subahdar-
ship of Malwa vice-Mukhtar Khan and an increment of 500
(1,500 tr.). The Emperor issued a farman on Shah ‘Aliyah,
who by command had formed his chhauni at Dhar in
Malwa, to march to Ahmadabad as Subahdar. As I have
finished briefly narrating the events of the whole year,
I shall turn to the account of the Emperor’s march from
Nabishahdurg towards Khatav.

Account of the conquest of Sadiqgarh, Namgir, Miftah
and Maftuh: * * * * * The Emperor who had stayed
for some time in the environs of Parnala in order to capture
it, started for Khatav for the benefit of the people, as the
abundance of provision in that place would give comfort to
the creatures of God, and also the report of the march of the
imperial army would lead to the recovery of forts Wardhan-
garh, Namgir, and Chandan and Wandan, from the hands
of the infidels. [443] With this view, the army started on
Thursday, the 29th May, 1701/2nd Muharram.

Fathullah Khan, who had been created a Bahadur in
reward of his splendid services, was ordered to go with an
advanced detachment and put down the rebellious infidels.
The Khan hastening, struck at the waist of the hill-garrison
of all the four forts, and slew a number of the enemy, and
seized innumerable cattle and prisoners. On seeing this
feat and the arrival of the army, the garrison of Wardan-
garh saved their lives by flight, leaving the fort empty,
on the 6th June/10th Muharram. As the Khan Bahadur’s
name was Muhammad Sadiq, the fort was renamed Sadiq-
garh. On Monday, the 28rd June/27th Muharram, the
Emperor ordered his tents to be pitched in the environs of
the fort, which is two kos from Khatav, for the purpose of
chhauni. From this place he sent the Khan Bahadur with
a large force under the command of Bakhshi-ul-mulk
Bahramand Khan to conquer Nandgir. In ten or twelve
days, the qiladar of Nandgir in fear of his life interviewed
that great minister, and surrendered the key to the Khan
Bahadur [444] and the fort was renamed Namgir, on
account of the renowned (chiefs) having turned to its con-
quest. From this place the Muslim army started for the
conquest of Chandan and Wandan, which were renamed
Miftah and Maftuh. First Chandan was besieged, and in
a short time the garrison begged for quarters, Next, fort


--- Page 278 ---
1701] SIEGE OF KHELNA-VISHALGARH 267

Wandan, a first-rate fort, was encircled by the army. The
garrison had no recourse except to beg for safety. On
Monday, the 6th October, 1701 they evacuated the fort. * * *

These four strong forts were conquered not in four
months [445] but in four days * * * *

In the course of this time, Umdat-ul-mulk Asad Khan
came by command from the base to the Court and had
audience. Ghaziuddin Khan Firuz Jang arrived from
Berar and was appointed to guard the base. Mukarram
Khan, who had taken to a life of retirement on a pension,
came from Delhi to see the Emperor, and after a few days
was given leave to return to his place of pious retreat.

Capture of Khelna and other events : [pp. 446-447] * *

The Emperor turned to the conquest of this (Khelna)
fort. For this purpose the army started from the neighbour-
hood of the fort of Sadiqgarh on the 7th November, 1701/
16th Jamad. S., and reached the environs of Malkapur in
twelve stages. On account of the roads from this place to the
Amba-ghat being difficult to traverse and for the purpose
of removing obstacles and intricacies, there was a halt of
seven days (here). Bidar Bakht, who at the time of return-
ing from Nabishahdurg [448] had been given leave to
pass the rainy season near Hukri, and Gokak and the
neighbouring tract, and had conquered many of the forts
of the infidels in a short time, was now ordered to come to
‘see’ fort Khelna with his troops by way of Borgaon, and
having burnt many villages and wadis on the way, met the
Emperor at this stage. Owing to unseasonable rain, all
sorts of hardship were borne at this unpleasant place. At
last through the agency of Fathullah Khan Bahadur, came
the joyful news of the roads being cleared and this distance
of four kos which was extremely hard to pass, was traversed
by the army with its abundant baggage with the greatest
ease,

On Saturday, the 6th December, 1701/16th Rajab,
the skirt of a hill, which on account of the spaciousness of
its open space and the elevation of the ground was suitable
for the residence of the army, was fixed upon as the quarters
of the troops. As Khelna is three and a half kos from it,
and the imperial army had not passed through this region

* Hukeri and Gokak, in the Belgaon district (Bom. Gaz. xii. 567 and 500).

more than two or three times in such large numbers and
with such materials (before?), the haughty heads of the
inhabitants of that quarter were trampled by the chargers
of the imperial army. In all the paths of this hilly tract
are impregnable forests and dense thorny jungle, at which
even the sun dares not look. [449] Lofty and stout trees
abound on all sides like the wretched infidels. The branches
were so intertwined that even an ant could hardly pass
through them. The path that there was, was difficult even
for footmen. The defiles and pits were deeply sunk. The
hills were firmly rooted in the soil. The Khan Bahadur
was ordered to remove these difficulties and hindrances
from the path. Under his supervision and efforts, sappers
(men with spades and axes) and stone-cutters in one week
wonderfully accomplished the work. Hills were removed ;
ups and downs levelled, and trees cut down. Thus a level
road was made broad enough for a hundred horsemen to
march abreast easily.

On the 23rd December, 1701/8rd Sh‘aban, the Khan
Bahadur was presented with a special quiver and sent to
guide the imperial army under the command of Umdat-ul-
mulk Madar-ul-maham Asad Khan and with the co-opera-
tion of Hamiduddin Khan [450] Bahadur, Mu‘nim Khan,
Ikhlas Khan, and Raja Jai Singh, and begin the siege of
the fort. On the 26th December /6th Shaban, Umdat-ul-
mulk was given the title of Amir-ul-umara, a jewelled
dagger, 4000 ashrafi as reward and the honour of kissing
the Emperor’s feet, and sent (to the siege). On that day
the Khan Bahadur with Hamiduddin Khan Bahadur;
Mu‘nim Khan and some other brave warriors entered the
pass before dawn. As the enemy had strengthened the
walls of the towers on it and occupied before-hand the
hillock overlooking the fort which the Khan Bahadur had
kept in view for mounting guns on, the Khan turned to
them. Having posted Hamiduddin Khan Bahadur to guard
the ambuscade on the left, Fathulla Khan Bahadur himself
went to the right side. Having extinguished with the wind
of valour their first day’s fuse, he with 13 or 14 men
suddenly fell upon the devils without number, and doubled
the height of the hillock with the heaps of the slain. The
enemy saw no recourse save in flight. They flung them-
selves down in bewilderment from the hillock and wanted
to run to the fort. The Khan Bahadur [451] before he
started had sent (some) men armed with jazirahs (long

1701 | SIEGE OF KHELNA PRESSED 269

matchlocks fired from rest) to punish the enemy, and these
were staying in the road leading to the fort. The enemy
finding this road closed by this measure, fled to the jungle
and hid themselves under the trees. At this time another
division of the imperialists had arrived close behind (the
first), and spreading out captured many of the enemy. The
Khan Bahadur sent them into the pit of destruction by
tying rocks to their waists. After this victory, he thought
it good generalship to take a firm stand on the hillock.
Tents were pitched there. In the evening the news reached
the Emperor. The Khan Bahadur was rewarded with an
increment of 200 tr., a standard and a jewelled dagger,
Hamiduddin Khan Bahadur with a katar, Mu‘nim Khan
with an Arab horse with gold coated sdz (as his horse had
been killed) and the Emperor’s own food. Promotions
were given to all the followers (baradari) of the Khan
Bahadur. The night was spent in entrenching. Next day
another hillock was captured from which arrows and guns
could be shot into the fort. Guns were mounted on the
hillock so as to burn and demolish the houses of the
garrison. A covered lane was commenced. [452]

On Sunday, the 11th January, 1702/22nd Shaban, the
Emperor went to view the work done and inspect the fort, and
ordered the trenches to be pushed on. And on Friday, the
16th January /27th Shaban, he removed his camp from its
former position to the plain half a kos from the fort in order
to back the front division and expedite the work.

CHAPTER XLVI.
46TH YEAR OF THE REIGN:

19th January, 1702—7th January, 1703.

% * * %

On Monday, the 19th January, Bidar Bakht, who had
been sent to patrol round the base camp and that region,
was ordered to turn back and station himself near Nabishah-
durg. Muhammad Amin Khan, Sadr-us-sadur, was given
a promotion of 200 tr. and a standard, and sent to descend
through the pass (kotal) of Amba ghat into Tal Kokan, and
devastate the enemy’s land up to the gate on the further
side of Khelna, and close the path of ingress and egress to
the garrison of the fort. Tarbiyat Khan by command, sat
down at the entrance (mouth) of Amba ghat. Muhammad
Amin Khan, [453] plundered the parganahs and villages
of that tract, seized many captives and cattle, and engaged
in closing the Kokani gate of the fort.

I shall now record the deeds of Khan Bahadur
Fathullah Khan. Having planted guns and jazirahs he
boldly carried the (covered) lane up to the ditch situated
before the rewni of the fort. The garrison, on their part
incessantly fired guns and muskets, day and night, and
carried away the lives of men of all kinds working in the
covered gallery (lane of safety). The Khan Bahadur firmly
pursued his work. The lives of friends and foes alike were
not worth purchasing at half a grain of barley. The enemy
who had run a concealed lane from the gate of the fort, and
sat in the rewni for offering opposition, on seeing that the
Khan Bahadur had made planks (dhabs), arrived in front
and wished to mount the ladders,—lost their senses and stood
perplexed with their faces to the walls. * * * They destroyed
the ladders, which had been raised from the midst of the pit
to the level ground under the gate. The Khan Bahadur
having made ladders out of kajawahs (camel-litter) and
fastened dhabs above them, advanced in front of the
advancing party.

I shall now briefly narrate the deeds of Muhammad
Amin Khan. He had been sent to close the Kokani gate.


--- Page 282 ---
1702 | SEVERE FIGHTING BEFORE KHELNA 271

Having bravely traversed the sky-high hill of Machal, [454]
he arrived at a hillock opposite the gate overlooking the rewn
of Khelna. The enemy had built stone-walls on it and deep
ditches before it. * * In short, for a time the veil of difficulty
covered the face of the progress of the undertaking. On
Wednesday, the 4th March, 1702/15th Shawwal, in utter
disregard of life, he climbed the hillock with honour-seeking
heroes, expelled the enemy from the redoubt and drove them
back to the rewni, Heaps were formed by the slain. The
road was closed to the- garrison and victory was gained.
The Emperor on hearing of it gave the title of Bahadur to
the Khan and sent him a dhup (Deccani sword), a robe, and
a farman. His comrades got suitable promotion, swords,
waist-daggers, horses, elephants, and robes.

The Emperor in his foresight summoned Bidar Bakht
from Nabishahdurg, and ordered him [455] to attempt the
conquest of the fort from the side of the Kokani gate, with
his own troops and those of Raja Jai Singh, the defender of
the trenches of Fathullah Khan Bahadur, and a few thou-
sand infantry sent by Yaqut Khan, collector (mutasaddt)
of Danda Rajpuri. He began to run trenches and overthrow
towers and battlements by cannonade. Muhammad Amin
Khan Bahadur was recalled to the Emperor on account of
illness. Although Fathullah Khan Bahadur with great
exertion fastened dhabs to the extremely hard rock and
reached the waist of the tower, and ran lanes from all sides,
* * * vet the success of the work did not come in sight at all.
Inspite of the severe bombardment by the shots of the guns,
Sher-dahan and Kark-bijli, which could split hills, only a
few stones were loosened from the tower. The enemy ceased
not to shower incessently matwalahs weighing 100 maunds
and 200 maunds. Some nights they made sorties and fell
on the trenches. The Khan Bahadur personally fought to
resist them. One day he was himself helping the labourers
in binding the dhabs, when a stone fell from above on a plank
16 fingers’ breadth in width, and broke it to pieces. The
Khan being hit on the head by it rolled down a long distance
and at last reached the edge of the Kajawah, which arrested
his descent and saved his life. His waist and (some) other
limbs were severely bruised. After a month he was able to
leave his bed, had audience, received a special sarpech, and
returned to his work. He was [456] planning to make a
feint and assault the fort from the side of another tower,
when through the exertions of Bidar Bakht the rewni of the


--- Page 283 ---
272 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI . [cH. 46

fort was captured on the 27th April, 1702/10th Zil. H.,
which meant in effect that the fort of Khelna was conquered.
In this assault Raja Jai Singh and his men did splendid ser-
vice. At the breaking down of this barrier the enemy lost
their composure of mind, even though they were as
numerous as (the armies of) Gog and Magog. * * * The
Shahzada was rewarded with a jewelled sarpech, the Raja
with the increment of 500 zat (2-hazar tr.), and other heroes
with promotion and favours. Asadullah, son of Saifullah
Khan, who used to travel on the roads with great speed and
bring intelligence, was given his father’s title. The Shah-
zada (was) ordered to carry the guns forward and batter
down the gate of the fort—which was not so very strong,
high and hard to open as the gate on Fathullah Khan
Bahadur’s side. But what shall I write of the severity of
the rain, which fell incessantly and fast, gallopping like a
two-horsed* trooper without let or hindrance, and ran for
10 and even 20 days at a time without opening the eyes or
raising the head? But inspite of all this, the warriors of
both the [457] trenches moved with the speed of the wind
sarsar: as they had no fear of the enemy, so they paid no
heed to this cruel calamity. Fathullah Khan in spite of the
road for assault not being prepared, the dhabs (planks)
having fallen down, and confusion having overtaken the
work, determined, that if he had to make an assault he
should at once climb the wall with the speed of wind and
thunder. Parashuram, on seeing all these preparations for
his ruin, sent to the Prince some Brahmans to make certain
requests and to offer to surrender the fort. A few days were
spent in carrying messages to and fro, through the media-
tion of Bakhshi-ul-mulk Ruhullah Khan and Fazail Khan
bayutat, who had been deputed by the Emperor. At last,
His Majesty granted no praver except this that he and the
garrison would go out with their lives. On Thursday, the
4th June/19th Muharram, Parashuraim planted with his
own hands the flags of the Shahzada and the Bakhshi-ul-
mulk ; and on Sunday, the 7th June, 1702 /22nd Muharram,
he came out under the veil of the darkness of night. By the
Emperor’s command none hindered him. * * *

[458] The Emperor renamed Khelna as Sakhkharlana
(=God made hell subject to us). The hills and soil of this

* Du-dspa—a trooper who carries a spare horse with him and can there-
fore always travel very fest,

tract are wonderful: there is (as it were) no trace of hill
or land, you see only herbs and flowers. Those who want to
behold God’s skill will find nothing so appropriate for their
purpose as this garden-like hill and plain. There is not a
tree that does not confer some benefit. It has no flower that
does not charm the brain with its smell. Every grain of
this wide plain can supply tHe revenue of countries from
its fruits and aromatic roots; every particle of its dust
attracts the heart. * * *

On Wednesday, the 10th June, 1702/25th Muharram,
the Emperor visited the fort by way of the trenches of Fath-
ullah Khan Bahadur; Zabit Khan with sufficient materials
was nade its qiladar. Its face is very strong. * * * But inside
it has no buildings, gardens or reservoirs that excel those of
other forts or can please the mind. As it is a frontier fort’
and the vast kingdoms of Balaghat and Painghat (Talkokan)
were annexed to the Empire through its conquest, and as
Emperors have a thousand secret political reasons for every
affair, therefore its conquest [459| was regarded as a great
victory. Next day the Shahzada was rewarded with one
lakh of rupees as in‘am, by the Emperor in greatness of joy,
and sent towards Hukri and Raibagh to form his encamp-
ment. Fathullah Khan Bahadur was rewarded with a
jewelled jigha and the addition of ‘dlamgirshahi to his title.
Ruhullah Khan and Hamiduddin Khan Bahadur each
received an increment of 200 tr. Khanahzad Khan, a 2-
hazari (400 tr.), close to the Emperor’s person, got an incre-
ment of 500 tr. and an elephant. Mu‘nim Khan became
darogha of filkhana and was promoted to be a hazari (800
tr.). ‘Abdullah Khan, (cor.) brother of Khwaja Lutfullah
(an old servant of the days of Princeship), the dismissed
qiladar of Agra, was removed from his rank of 2-hazari
(1,000 tr.), for some reasons. Mir Abul Wafa, grandson of
Ziauddin Khan deceased, elder brother of Khanahzad Khan,
was made darogha of ja-namaz-khana in addition to his
former post, vice Fath Muhammad Qul, the deceased old
servant. The fineness of understanding and ingenuity of
intellect which was innate in his fertile genius, displayed
itself in the Emperor’s Court in a short time. One instance
of the brilliance of his genius was this : A letter was received
by the Emperor from Muhammad Mu‘azzam Bahadur Shah
written in cypher (khatt-i-ramz). As it could not be
deciphered, the Emperor handed his private memorandum-
book over to the Mir saying [460] ‘‘I have left (undeci-

35


--- Page 285 ---
274 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI [cH. 46

phered) two or three obscure hints (ramz) of this letter.
Compare them with these and extract the meaning.’’ The
Mir, guided by his penetrating sight and quick-moving
brain, brought that puzzling ramz out of the veil of obscurity
into the light of deciphering, and, writing out the purport
of the Prince’s letter in full, showed it to the Emperor. The
Emperor praised him and formed a high opinion of his capa-
city. He was rewarded for this with a mohar weighing 50
mohars, 500 rupees, and an addition of 20 tr., to his rank
by which he became a 4-sadi (80 tr.). “

On the 18th February, 1702/1st Shawwal, the ‘Id-ul-
fitr was celebrated as usual. As the Amir-ul-umara was ill,
the Emperor graciously ordered that he would issue from
the inner side of the hall of justice which was henceforth
ordered to be designated ‘‘the hall of the oppressed’’, enter
the passage and sit down in the kathra at a distance of one
zir‘a from the steps of the hujra (cell). For three days he sat
there and afterwards stood as before. ‘Inayetullah Khan
was presented with an elephant. Mukhtar Khan, nazim of
Agra, a 24-hazari got an increment of 500. Tarbiyat Khan
Mir Atish, a 3-hazari (500 tr.), got 500 more. Diadnat Khan
mutasaddi of the port of Surat, by an increment of 500 be-
came a 2-hazari (150 tr.). On the 27th April, 1702, occurred
the ‘Id-uz-zuha. On Tuesday, the 25th August /12th Rabi.
S.,* screens were set up round a tent containing the pro-
phet’s relics. [461] The Emperor acquired blessing by
making a pilgrimage (zid@rat) and keeping vigil there. Inci-
dentally he learnt that a person had come within the gulal-
bar in a palki. An order was issued that none should come
in a palki except the Amir-ul-umara, Bahramand Khan,
Ruhullah Khan, Khanahzad Khan and Hamiduudin Khan
Bahadur. ‘Azizullah Khan Qurbegi was made qiladar of
Qandahar (within the Deccan) vice Saziwar Khan. A 1}-
hazari (800 tr.), he got an increment of 200 tr. Bidar Bakht
was ordered to guard Aurangabad. Lwutfullah Khan, nazim
of that place was sent as Subahdar of Berar as deputy (naib)
of Khan Firuz Jang. But before reaching the place he died.
He was endowed with learning and great bravery, and
repeatedly did excellent service, and spent most of his life
in high offices at the Court or in commanding troops outside.
On Thursday, the 5th November /25th Jamad. S., Bahra-
mand Khan Mir Bakhshi, brother’s son of Ja‘far Khan,

*On the Ith Rabi. S. Shaikh ‘Abdul Qadir Gilani died; on the 12th
Rabi. A. the Prophet passed away.

son-in-law of the Amir-ul-umar4 died of paralysis. By com-
mand Kam Bakhsh condoled with the Amir-ul-umara and
brought him to Court. The Emperor soothed his wounded
heart with consolatory words, and presented him with a
special robe and a jewelled sarpech. "The deceased Khan
was a noble possessed of dignity, modesty, grandeur, purity
of nature, gracious looks and amiability. Zulfigar Khan
Bahadur Nasrat Jang became Mir Bakhshi vice the deceased.
[462] Khudabanda Khan became faujdar of Karnatak-
Bijapuri vice Chin Qalich Khan being restored to his former
post. Muhammad Yar Khan nazim of Delhi, became fauj-
dar of Moradabad, and by an increment of 500 (same tr.)
was raised to the rank of 34-hazari (300 tr.), and presented
with kettledrums. As Mun‘im Khan had shown delay in
going to reinforce Muhammad Amin Khan, he was punished
with decrease of 200 zat (50 tr.) and removal from the post
of (darogha of) filkhanah, Hamiduddin Khan Bahadur
getting that post and an increment of 500 zat (250 tr.) to his
rank of 24-hazari (850 tr.). Although I had numerous offices
and was appointed to write urgent secret orders, yet the post
of munshi of the nazdrat was added to them. The post of
newswriter was conferred on my son Hafiz Muhammad
Muhasan vice myself.

News came to the Emperor from Delhi that Zebunnisa
Begam had died. The Emperor was so saddened by the
news as to shed tears, but had to resign himself to God’s
will. Order was sent to Sayyid Amjad Khan, Shaikh
‘Ataullah, and Hafiz Khan (Nur Muhammad) to give alms
(for the benefit of her soul) and build her tomb in the
appointed place, namely the Garden of Thirty-thousand
(Tis Hazari), which was a legacy from Jahanara.

[463] Return of the Emperor from Sakhkharlana to
Bahadurgarh and some other events.

On Wednesday, the 10th June, 1702/25th Muharram,
the imperial army set out towards Bahadurgarh. One can
imagine how very long a time the army took to cross, in the
midst of this heavy and incessant rain, the pass (kotal) which
it had traversed in many days even in dry weather. Of the
baggage-animals, * * * * the camels refused to set foot on
this path; the elephants began to carry the loads of the
camp in a dazed condition, but through the inclemency of


--- Page 287 ---
276 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI [cH. 46

the weather sank into the mud like donkeys. * * * * What
was (to be) undergone was undergone. Porters carried on
their heads the property and baggage of all the men (of the
army). * * * * [464] Rich men, reposing in the paradise
of comfort, somehow or other arrived at the foot of the kotal
which was the first halting-place. Owing to the non-arrival
of the stores (karkhanazat), the imperial army had to delay.
The Emperor ordered the things to be entrusted to the com-
mandant of Sakhkharlana. After seven days the forward
march was resumed. The nullah in the way permitted the
imperial cortege to pass, and then opened its mouth to devour
the people. For some time a halt had to be made here.
Whosoever was drowned was drowned, and he whom fate
saved was saved. As the march for the next stage was re-
newed, the same nullah was encountered. It was a strange
fraud of the deceitful (nullah) that it first cunningly allowed
the passage of the advance-tents of the Emperor and other
owners of advance-tents, and afterwards ran like a rash
horse, making all people utterly helpless. The owners of
elephants with much persuasion and coaxing rescued from
the nullah their usurped property. Others tould only cry
Alas! and strike their foreheads. At last at a distance of
one kos the Emperor took the left side road to Malkapur.
In this stage a nullah obstructed the path without heeding
the lamentations of the people. * * * In this evil time grain
sold at a rupee a seer; fodder and firewood appeared only
by mistake. The helpless people died from the heavy rain.
Having trodden their property underfoot, the men passed
their time in peace of mind, [465] and wondered at the
hardness of their lives.

One day Muzaffar, a mansabdar of the Emperor’s own
retinue, interviewed His Majestv during his journey. After
alighting at the mansion the Emperor addressed Hamid-
uddin Khan Bahadur, saying ‘‘Dilaram was a slave-girl
(parastar) of long service; after bringing up (her) daughter
she had married her to Muzaffar, who to-day came under my
notice during the journey as a whitebearded man. Have the
couplet

‘Fix your heart on the Heart’s Delight (Dilaram) that
you have,
Withdraw your eyes from the rest of the world,”’

and this hemistich, ‘‘You will be unique if you be devoted
to one’’, written in a large hand and carving them on a


--- Page 288 ---
1702] ARMY SUFFERS IN RAIN AND FLOOD att
stone-slab, bring them to me’’. The Khan carried out the
order in a few days and presented the piece to the Emperor
who said ‘‘Give this stone-slab to Muzaffar to carry it to
Delhi and fix it on the tomb of the deceased Dilaram.”’
Five hundred rupees were presented to him. An order was
issued to the clerks of Delhi to give a tankhwa (assignment)
on the revenue of the province for one year’s salary to the
man. After two years when he returned to the Emperor he
got his full and standard (kamal) salary and an increment of
50 zat. * * * *

[466] On Saturday, the 4th July, 1702/19th Safar, the
Emperor crossed the nullah on an elephant and pitched his
tent at a distance of one kos from it. He got a place to sit
down in the hujra (small room or recess) of the ‘adalat. The
Prince and other grandees had not even the power to stand
in their tents. His Majesty, patient as a mountain, spacious
as the ocean, used frequently to say, ‘‘A little cloud is
showering rain, a little wind is blowing. Why then have the
people been seized with despair?’’ He encouraged them
by repeating the (Quranic) verses, ‘‘O ve who believe! seek
help with the patients and with praver, for God is with the
patient. But ye understand not. With a little fear and
hunger, and loss of wealth and lives and fruits, will we
surely prove you! but bear good tidings to the patient, who
when a misfortune happens to them say, ‘Verily, we are
God’s and to Him shall we return’’.*

Ah! After a few days of darkness, the sun broke forth
again and cheered the people.

On Sunday, the 26th July, 1702/12th Rabi. A., when
the labouring army after traversing fourteen kos [467] in
one month and 17 days, reached the foot of fort Nabishah-
durg (Panhala), the sun again shone in the former manner.
The men in need of food began to stir, and appetite and
avarice again prevailed. The chill passed away from the
mind. Porters ran on all sides. A load descended from
the heads and necks of the people. * * *

The men lagging behind, in a condition which may no
man ever see! came up limping. On Wednesday, the 29th
July /15th Rabi. A., the imperial camp reached Vadgaon.+

After a stay of one month and eight days, it set out for
Bahadurgarh. On Sunday, the 6th September /24th Rabi.
S., although the rain did not cease, and news came of the
flood in the Krishna river, these difficulties could not deflect
the Emperor from his purpose. Covering nine kos in sixteen
days of march and halt, the whole army reached the river
bank. The river was violent and wavy. The army began to
cross in boats. [468] In this state of hardship half the army
crossed over in ten days. The Emperor embarked to cross
to the other bank. The imperial camp stayed for twenty
days more on the opposite bank, till the whole army had
crossed in safety. * * *

Hence he marched by stages to As‘adnagar, where he
halted a few days, and then encamped at Bahadurgarh. In
travelling through these (last) stages, the Emperor gazed
on a road four kos from beginning to end in length, bordered
on both sides by the paraphernalia of the army of Ghazi-
uddin Khan Bahadur Firuz Jang. The Khan had sent from
the base of Islampur his mahalla (troops for review) with
splendid equipment and decorations and material exceeding
the means of a high grandee, and guns above the allowance
of a general, and abundant peshkash of every kind. Among
them a short sword was accepted by the Emperor and named
‘‘the Young Ghazi’’. Much of the artillery was confiscated
to the State. The Emperor issued an order that the damirs
should not keep more guns than those allowed. It is proper to
give here a copy of the sentences written by the Emperor
himself, according to which a ‘By order’ letter [469] was
written to Bidar Bakht, ‘‘The mahalla which Khan
Firuz Jang, a 7-hazari, showed in his quarters, contained
guns, gajnal, shutarnal, ghornal, and all (other) things, as
many as he ought to maintain according to his mansab, nay,
more than what ought to be kept by a general, in addition
to what had been placed under him by the Government.
Why do you, who are getting double his salary, waste your
money, and spend it without any use (in return for it)? The
doing of what is required of us as a duty, is in itself an
evidence of perfection. Verse :—Only a little of life is
left, and yet the master of the house is senseless with
pride!’? * * *

Conquest of fort Kondana: On Thursday, the 8rd
December, 1702/24th Rajab, the army set out for the con-
quest of Kondana and on Sunday, the 27th Dec. /18th
Shaban arrived at the foot of the fort.

[470] Muhammad ‘Azim, the Subahdar or Bengal, got
in addition the Subahdari of Bihar, vice Shamshir Khan,
who became Subahdar of Mu‘azzamabad Oudh. A promo-
tion of 500 zat unconditionally in each case was given to
Najabat Khan, Subahdar of Burhanpur and faujdar of
Baglana, a 2-hazadri (1500 tr.), Shiv Singh qiladar of
Rairi, a hazari (same tr.) and Sarandaz Khan, naib of the
subah of Berar on behalf of Khan Firuz Jang, a 14-hazari
(500 tr.). Muhtasham Khan became qiladar of Naldurg
vice Qasim Khan, Bidar Bakht the nazim of the subah of
Aurangabad became Subahdar of Khandesh (in addition ?).
A 15-hazari (10-hazar tr.), he got an increment of 2-hazdar
tr. Nasrat Jang Khan was sent to punish the enemy near
Burhanpur, and rewarded with a jewelled muttaka and four
elephants. Sultan Muhi-us-sunnat, son of Kam Bakhsh,
got the rank of 7-hazari (2,000 tr.), a standard and kettle-
drums. Mut‘izzuddin, Subahdar of Multan and Tatta was
rewarded for his exertions in extirpating the turbulent
Bakhtiar, by the sending of a royal letter, a robe, a jewelled

Fazail Khan,* son of Wazir Khan, (Mir Haji), Mir Munshi,
Bayutat and deputy Khan-i-siman, died. Virtues and
accomplishments were the upper garment of this expert one
of our times. He used to say about himself, ‘‘The man is
present. Where is the work?’? The Emperor said about
him, ‘‘He used to discharge the duties of deputy Khan-i-
saman in such a way as almost to illuminate my house”’
‘Abdur Rahim, son of Fazil Khan deceased, who came to
Court from Delhi after his father’s death, got the post of
bayutat, the title of Khan and increase of rank. The
Emperor said, ‘‘Fazil Khan ‘Ala-ul-mulk and Fazil Khan
(Burhanuddin) have great claims on me for their services.
I shall cherish and bring up this house-hold servant’. And
he too had great capacity and worth. But he died in a few
days in the bloom of youth. And as none was left of this
family except Ziauddin, brother’s son and (own) son-in-law
of Fazil Khan Burhanuddin, he was summoned to Court
from the diwani of the country of Chinapatan [472], given
an increment of rank, the title of Khan and the post
of bayutat. The good services and ability of Fathullah
Khan Bahadur in conquering forts and punishing the enemy
are so much in circulation in the mouths of people that there
is no need to record them here. He had set his heart on
being appointed to Kabul and had often requested the
Emperor about it; on Friday, the 28th May, 1703/28rd
Muharram, his desire was granted. He got an increment
of 500 to his rank of 24-hazari (1,000 tr.) and started for
Kabul in great joy; Muhammad Quli, newly arrived from
Persia (vildyet), Bot a hazari (100 tr. ), the title of Khan,

* Mulla ‘Ala-ul-mulk Tuni, Fazil Khan J, (hfe in A7.1". iii, 524), one of
the most learned Persian emigrants to India, died in June 1603 only sixteen
days after being appointed High Diwan. His brother’s son named Burhan-
ud-din came to India about this time and was enrolled in the Delhi Govern-
ment service, being created Qabil Khan, ‘Itimad Klan (Dec. 1674), and
finally Fazil Khan III (in Nov. 1688). He held the posts of Khan-i-Samin
(1688-1697) and Subahdfar of Kashmir (1697-Oct. 1700), dving on the way at
Burhainpur when coming to Court. (His life in A/.U. iii. 34-38). In 1703,
as son Abdur Rahim was appointed bayutat, vice Fazail Khan deceased,
(below).

Fazail Khan, was originally Mir Hadi, the son of Wazir Khan Mir Haji,
the diwain of Prince Muhammad ‘Azam, and a disciple of the scholar-saint
Shaikh ‘Abdul ‘Aziz of Agra. (His life in M.U. iii. 38-40). Enrolled in the
service of Prince Muhammad ‘Azam, over whom he acquired very great
influence, after his Shaikh’s death in April 1678, After having been detained
at Agra without employment or liberty for many years from 1683 (probably
because the Emperor suspected hin of inclining the Prince towards the
Shia creed), he was called to the Emperor’s Court, appointed Chief-Secretary
(Mir Munshé), keeper of the imperial library, deputy Khan-i-Saman and
bayntat, with the title of Fazdil Khan. He died on 13 March 1703. There
was no connection between this Faziil Khan and the two Fazil Khans above,

set in it, a gold punchhi set with diamond, five jewelled rings

(300 tr.). Khanahzad Khan, close to the Emperor’s person,
was given the title of Mir. .

After having done the recording of certain events of
this year, I shall now narrate the conquest of Kondana and
other events. The Emperor ordered his soldiers to mount
the hill under the command of Tarbiyat Khan, Mir Atish,
and fire on the besieged. The Khan mounted (big) guns
on a hillock opposite the tower of this tall fort, and for some
time engaged in burning the enemy and demolishing their
towers and battlements, so that the beastly enemy were
driven out of their grazing ground. On Thursday, the
8th April, 1703/2nd Zil. H., this and other forts capitu-
lated. It was renamed Bakhshenda Bakhsh. Truly it is
so strong a fort that no amount of exertion but only the
Giver’s gift could have led to its conquest. As the rainy
season was impending and the difficulty of the road extreme,
[475] in view of the fact that the Emperor’s aim was
restricted to the conquest of fort Rajgarh, it was decided to
pass the rainy season at Muhiabad Puna, and afterwards
pursue the object. On Saturday, the 24th April, 1703/18th
Zil. H., the return march to that place was ordered, and it
was reached on Saturday, the Ist May/25th Zil. H.

I shall narrate an incident of this period which shows
the Emperor’s regard for his servants, recognition of merit,
and attention to the rules governing men and _ perfect
justice.

At the time of the imperial camp alighting at Puna, by
chance the quarters of the Amir-ul-umara were located on-a
low land and those of ‘Inayetullah Khan, nazim of Khalsa
and tan on a higher tract. After some time when the Khan
had enclosed the land adjoining the quarters of his harem,
Vasant, eunuch of the Amir-ul-umar4, sent a man to say
“Get out of this place, the nawwab’s tent will be pitched
here’’. The Khan sent reply ‘‘Very well; please wait till I
have found some other spot in this misl, in which I have to
take up (my) quarters’. The eunuch gave a rude answer.
The Khan removed his tent to another place in the same
neighbourhood, and the Amir -ul-umara’s tent was set up
there. From the news-sheet of Ikhlaskesh, news-writer of
the kachari [476] of the diwin, this matter came to the
Emperor’s knowledge. He immediately ordered Hamidud-
din Khan Bahadur to go and tell the Amir-ul-umara, ‘It
was not done well. You should go to your former place or
some other spot. The man who had set up his tent before,


--- Page 294 ---
1703] QUARREL BETWEEN ASAD AND INAYETULLAH | 283

should remain in his own place’. The Khan conveyed
the order. The Amir-ul-umara delayed in consenting to
it. The Khan Bahadur leaving him there went in a
friendly manner to ‘Inayetullah Khan’s house and narrated
the occurrence, saying ‘‘It is better that you should go to
Amir-ul-umara and say that you have got another place
and that you don’t wish him to change his quarters.’’
‘Indyetullah Khan said ‘‘You went to the Amir-ul-umara
by command. How can I go to him without order?’? The
Khan Bahadur on coming to the Emperor reported the
whole affair. Next day when the Amir-ul-umara came to
His Majesty at the time of holding Court, the Emperor
ordered Ihtamam Khan Qul to take the Amir-ul-umara to
‘Inayetullah Khan and make him beg pardon for what had
occurred. Asad Khan had not so many lives that he could
disobey the order now. He submitted and carried out the
order. Amir Khan sent me to convey this message to
‘Inayetullah Khan. ‘‘Such an order has been issued. But
it is advisable that you should quickly petition the Emperor
to postpone the visit of the Amir-ul-umara.’’ My going at
mid-day and the visit of the Amir-ul-umara to the Khan’s
house happened at the same time. My message remained
undelivered. By chance ‘Inayetullah Khan was at his bath.
The Amir-ul-umara came aid sat down in the diw4n-
khanah in which the carpet had not been yet spread. The
Khan quickly came out, the Amir-ul-umara took his hand,
rose, and riding brought him to his own house. [477] He
presented one than of cloth by way of welcoming to the
Khan and never to the end of the period of their being
together did he in any way express complaint or displeasure
(against the Khan) but increased his favours and attempts to
please. Such men have lived under the sky and passed the
stages of their lives in this excellent manner ! .

After a stay of six months and eighteen days, inspite
of famine on account of drought, death of the poor,
lamentation of the weak, the disappearance of wheat, vetch
and rice, the filling of Shahganj (royal market) to the brim
with the groans of the stricken beggars, the Emperor’s
resolution would not turn back, let the celestial firmament
turn back if it will! So, on Wednesday, the 10th November,
1703 /12th Rajab, the army marched out for the conquest
of Rajgarh. Four kos from this fort* is a kotal reaching

= ———-—— pe a nay nerrencinee enema

up to the sky. Although for two months labourers had
been working hard to level the ups and downs, yet when
can the looks of earthly men rise to the sky, and where
can the hand of the celestials be equalled by that of the
terrestrials? * * * In seven days the army crossed the pass,
and after [478] passing one more stage, arrived on Sunday,
the 28th November /30th Rajab, at the narrow plain at the
foot of the fort.

Fort Rajgarh is a hill second only to the fort of the
towered sky.

Bg * * %

Its circuit is twelve kos. Imagination cannot estimate
its height. Its thorny jungles and spectre-haunted chasms
can be traversed only by the wind. Nothing can descend
on it except rain! In former days, the ‘Adilkhani kings
possessed it. The infernal Shiva after gaining possession
[of Rajgarh], made terraces on three sides around it on a
lower level [machi] and there built three strong forts,
namely Suvela and Padmavati situated towards Kokan
uplands, and Sanjivani on the side of Kokan lowlands;
he thus made its capture by any enemy impossible.
On Thursday, the 2nd December, 1703/4th Shaban, the
Emperor issued orders that under the supervision of Hamid-
uddin Khan Bahadur and management of Tarbiyat Khan,
Mir Atish, the army should begin the attack on the fort.

[479] The infidel now in hell (namely Shivaji) had
formed a triangular enclosure, which is called a sund
(? elephant’s trunk) in the language of military fortification,
by erecting two thick walls from the postern-gate (wicket)
.of the fort of Padmawat to the end of the hillock, and making
these two walls meet at a point. Below both of these (walls)
the path declines so sharply and is so full of slippery holes
that no one can pass there on foot. At the junction of the
two walls, Shiva had built an even stronger tower, which
opened upon the back of the hillock opposite to it. Here he
had collected war materials.

As the apex of this tower is thirty yards in height,
straight as a stretched rope, the two active generals told off
by the Emperor for the attack, working from the side of
Padmawat, built a raised battery, lofty as a hill, opposite
this tower and carried the work up to the sang-chin

(protective bulwark of loose stones round the raised plat-
form). While this work was being pushed on, although the
garrison erected batteries of their own, they did not succeed
(in stopping the imperialists). Our thundering guns,
which were planted at certain points to demolish the fort-
towers and walls, did havoc to them in many places.

Sindhia and Chatrasal Bundela. News came from in-
formants on the frontier of Persia that Prince Muhammad
Akbar, who had fled into the wilderness of disappointment
and whose affairs have been described in previous years
[484] had died. The Emperor consoled himself by reading
the verse of tarji‘a and said, ‘‘The great disturber of
Hindustan has subsided.’’ He sent the news to Zinat-
un-nisa Begam, and presented a mourning turban-end to
Akbar’s son Buland Akhtar. Condolatory turban-ends

T shall now turn to the narration of the history of the
remaining portion of the siege of Rajgarh.

On Sunday, the 6th February, 1704/11th Shawwal,
our heroes mounted the tower and penetrated inside the
wall, driving the enemy, who had come up to oppose them,
back to confinement in the fort. They firmly established
themselves here. Although these prisoners closed the door
of submission on themselves and for a time did not slacken
in discharging guns, muskets, rockets and stones, and

through the lack of shelters many of the holy warriors met
with martyrdom, yet the sight of their valour and sacrifice
of life, shook the resolution of the enemy; [485] their
generals Firangaji and Damaji* sent an envoy to the house
of Bakhshi-ul-mulk Ruhullah Khan to beg for quarters. At
the Khan’s intercession the Emperor ordered that the
garrison might go out without arms or armour. On
Wednesday, the 16th February/21st Shawwal, they with
their own hands planted the imperial banner on the top of
the fort, and themselves retired to the pit of ruin. That
very day Bakhshi-ul-mulk Hamiduddin Khan Bahadur with
other grandees entered the fort by the door, and raising to
the sky the loud shout of conquering four such forts, ex-
‘pelled the infidels as he had been commanded. * * *

Hamiduddin Khan Bahadur, who a few days before had
received the increment of 500 zat (800 tr.), making him a
3}-hazari (2-hazar tr.) was now rewarded for his heroism
with the permission to beat the naubat. ‘Tarbiyat Khan
was rewarded for the conquest of the fort with an increment
of 500 zat (200 tr.) which made him a 34-hazari (1,800 tr.).
[486] The Bakhshi-ul-mulk, who had been promoted to be
a 84-hazadri (1500 tr.) was presented with a costly jewelled
sarpech. The fort was renamed Nabishahgarh.’

Capture of Torna fort: Torna was situated four kos
from Rajgarh. On Wednesday, the 23rd February,
1704/28th Shawwal, the imperial tent was pitched in its
neighbourhood, and the heroes, as usual, were sent to
attempt the capture of the fort. * * * In spite of the strength
of the fort, Tarbiyat Khan engaged himself in running
trenches on the side of its gate. Muhammad Amin Khan
Bahadur closed the path of egress to the garrison on the
other side. Other guards enclosed it around. * * * [487].

Amanullah Khan, grandson of Alahwardi Khan J‘afar,
who was famous for his reckless valour in this family of
brave men, in the night of Friday, the 10th March,
1704/15th Zil.Q., when the 89th lunar year of the
Emperor’s life began, inspired some Mavlé infantry, from
his own side, so that first one of them in disregard of life
went up to the sangchin of the fort and fastened a rope ladder

(mal) strongly to a rock, and then twenty-five others of the.
same party ascended the hill by means of the noose (rope-
ladder), entered the fort, and raised the din of fighting.
The Khan, his brother ‘Ataullah Khan and some others
in disregard of their lives followed them quickly on hearing
of it. Hamiduddin Khan Bahadur, who was walking on
every side in search of an opportunity, tied a rope to his
waist like the first party and entered close behind. The
infidels who offered resistance were slain. The rest fled to
the citadel and shut the door. Although this hard enter-
prise in this simplified form was one of no small (danger),
yet where could cowards resist the charge of heroes, and
hes. the enemy became helpless and begged for quarters.

he Emperor permitted them to leave the fort without their
arms. The fort was renamed Fatuh-ul-ghaib. The Khan
Bahadur Hamiduddin was rewarded with a robe, a fathpech
and doshala fromm the Emperor’s own wardrobe. Amanullah
Khan by an increment of 500 zat (200 do daspa tr.) became a
1}-hazari (700 tr.). Others were properly rewarded. As
through the blessedness of the aims of the Emperor, the
people escaped the hardships and dangers of passing the
rainy season in this fatal region, the Emperor set out on
the return march towards the old dominions for making
chhauni in the neighbourhood of Junnar. [489] On
Wednesday, the 15th March, 1704/20th Zil. Q., Mir Khan,
close to the Emperor’s person, got his father’s hereditary
title of Amir Khan. ‘The Emperor said, ‘‘When your
father Mir Khan became Amir Khan he presented to the
Emperor Shah Jahan one lakh of rupees in return for the
granting of alif (to his name). What will you present?”
He replied, ‘‘May a thousand thousand lives be sacrificed to
Your Majesty! My life and property are all propitiatory
alms (tasadduq) for the sake of Your Majesty!’’ Next day
he presented to the Emperor, a Quran in the handwriting
of Yaqut. The Emperor remarked, ‘‘You have made a
present which exceeds the world and its contents in price,’’
and gave him an elephant. On Tuesday, the 9th May,
1704/15th Muharram, Bakhshi-ul-mulk Ruhullah Khan
died in the fulness of his youth and prosperity. Mourning
rebes were sent to the houses of his sons Khalilullah Khan
and ‘Itiqad Khan (who afterwards got the title of Ruhullah
Khan). They came to bow to the Emperor. who. consoled
them. The daughter of the deceased came to Court; she
was consoled with the present of jewels worth 5,000 rupees,

Monday the 17th April, 1704/28rd Zil. H., the Emperor
fixed his camp at [490] the village of Khed, which was
renamed Mas‘audabad. After staying here for seven and
a half months, the army started for Wagin-gera. * * *

MARCH FOR THE CONQUEST OF WAGIN-GERA

I have already narrated some of the incidents of the
capture of Nasratabad Sagar from Pam Naik, his coming
to the imperial Court at Haidarabad through the mediation
of Khanahzad Khan, son of Ruhullah Khan, and his flight
to hell shortly afterwards. [491] Afterwards when
Ruhullah Khan, son of Khalilullah Khan, was ordered in
the 32nd year of the reign (to go) from Fathabad Koragaon
to conquer Raichur, Pidia, brother’s son and adopted son
of Pam Naik, who, in the 28th [corr. 27th] year at the
time of the Emperor’s dismounting at Ahmadnagar, had
come to Court and received a mansab, was taken by the
Khan with himself, as likely to render help in the work.
This trickster informed the Khan, after the conquest of
Raichur that if he could get permission he would like to go
to Wagingera for a week, replenish his materials and equip-
ment, and come back. This place was a village within the
jurisdiction of Sagar. Its habitations are situated on a
hill. After Sagar had been wrested from Pam Naik,
it developed into the home and refuge of the infidel (rebels).
The Khan being deceived gave the permission. The wretch
after reaching his shelter violated his promise, took up an
attitude of opposition, and tried to strengthen this place,
i.e., to make a qamargha with twelve or thirteen thousand
musketeers. * * *

When the Khan employed force against him, he kept
himself safe partly by force and partly by money. The
Khan was summoned to Court; and he outwardly conducted
himself as a tenant, continued to pay revenue, but gradually
gathered together wealth, built a wall on one side of the
hill, and assembled [492] fighting footmen, and thus
constituted Wagin-gera. By increasing the buildings of the
town and the cultivation in its neighbourhood, he acquired
power-and authority, and became the leading partner of the

292 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI [cx. 48

Marathas in raising disturbances and rebellion, and dis-
possessed Jagid, the legitimate son of Pam Naik, the heir
to the estate. The latter betook himself to the Court and
took service there. After learning of Pidia’s robberies on
all sides and his devastation (of the property) of high and
low, the Emperor sent ‘Azam Shah to extirpate him. Then
he interviewed the Prince and saved himself from destruction
by paying seven lakhs of rupees (as tribute). And during
the governorship (lit., domination) of Ghaziuddin Khan
Bahadur Firuz Jang, he followed the same policy, and by
paying in all a tribute of nine lakhs of rupees saved himself.

When the Emperor’s attention was absorbed in con-
quering the country of Bijapur, this short-sighted man again
provoked his own ruin. Till at last, the Emperor being
free from the conquest of those great forts and the opening of
so many difficult passes leading to Junnar, the time of
retribution on the infidel arrived. On Sunday, the 22nd
October, 1704/4th Rajab, the Emperor set out towards it.

AQTH YEAR OF THE REIGN. 1116 A.H.
17th December, 1704—5th December, 1705.

[493] * * * ‘Azizullah Khan uncle of Ruhullah Khan
deceased, who had been summoned from Aurangabad after
the latter’s death, had audience. At Firuz Jang’s request,
the hazari zat (same tr.) deducted from the rank of Rustam
Khan, nadib-Subahdar of Berar, was restored; Mir Khan,
son of Amir Khan deceased, a hazari (500tr.) got an
increment of a 100 tr. Tahawwar Khan, son of Salabat
Khan deceased, darogha of Qurkhanah, got the title of
Fidai Khan. The ‘Id-ul-fitr occurred on the 16th January,
1705 /1st Shawwal, 1116.

Buland Akhtar’s tent was a saracha with dsbak. On
account of some offence, the Emperor ordered that it should
be a tent (tambu) with galandari and an enclosure of cloth
screens (qanat.) Hafiz Nur Muhammad, Mir-i-saman of the
establishment of Gauharara Begam, having written and
corrected selections from the Ahid-ul-ulum, sent it as a
present to the Emperor and was rewarded with an elephant,
1000 rupees in cash, and the title of [494] Hafiz Khan.
Rustamdil Khan, the dismissed faujdar of Karnatak-
Bijapuri, was appointed naib-Subahdar of Haidarabad, vice
Daud Khan and received an increment of 500 zat (same tr.)
to his rank of 2-hazdri (1,000 tr.). Chin Qalich Khan
Bahadur, nazim of Bijapur, got the faujdari vice him. He
was a 4-hazari (same tr.), and now got an increment of
2,000 tr. and 5 lakhs of dam as in‘am.

On Tuesday, the 18th March 1705/28th Zil. Q., news
came from Ahmadabad that Jahanzeb Banu Begam, wife of
Shah ‘Alijah, had died. Some trusty female friends, who
had access to her, said, ‘‘a pimple of the size of a lentil
appeared on the nipple of her right bosom. For some time
medicine was taken, yet the swelling grew wide and thick
and its inflammation at times caused a burning fever. The
doctors applied medicines. At last Monsieur Martin, the
Frenchman, said ‘‘There is a_ skilful woman-surgeon
(haziqa) among my relatives at Delhi. If she is summoned
and after examining the patient tells me the details of the


--- Page 305 ---
294 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI [cH. 49

case, she will be quickly cured.’’ After her arrival, the
Begam said to her foster-brother (Koka), ‘‘“Summon her,
and inquire about her age and habit of drinking wine.’’ The
Koka after inquiry reported, ‘‘She is 40 years old, and
drinks wine.’’ The Begam said, ‘‘It is certain that I shall
not be able to save myself from, this disease which is daily
increasing. I don’t wish that my body should be touched
by a sinner.’’ Although the Shah pressed her, it had no
effect. The disease lingered for two years, and at last she
died.’’ In all two lakhs of rupees were spent in furnishing
the corpse, shrouding it, distributing money and food [495 |
(to beggars), sending the corpse to Delhi, and burying it in
the cemetery of Khwaja Qutbuddin Bakhtiar. The Shah
gave up hearing music and seeing dances, of which he was
very fond from his youth. All her jewels were sent to
Bidar Bakht. Her other things and cash were made over
to the officers of Najib-un-nisa Begam.

Sayyid Asalat Khan, an officer serving under the
Crown Prince, came to Court by command. At the Prince’s
request he received an increment of 500 zat (200 tr.) making

tion of Ibrahim Khan became faujdar of Pakhli Dhamtur

troopers. Kanhoji Shirké, a 5-hazari (same tr.), got an
increment of a hazadr zat. Murid Khan, son of Himmat
Khan, became qiladar of the port of Surat, vice Dilir Khan
deceased. Hamid Khan Bahadur quarrelling with Firuz
Jang Khan came to Court. He was a 2-hazari (1,000 tr.),
and now regained the 500 zat (same tr.) which had been
reduced. WVasudeo, zamindar of Chandankera, got his first
mansab (a 8-hazari zat) and an elephant. Raja Shahu, by
command, went to and came back from the house of Firuz
Jang with the.troops of Hamiduddin Khan Bahadur. [496]
Monday, the 4th June, 1705/2nd Safar had been fixed for
giving leave to Kam Bakhsh to go to Haidarabad. But the

296 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI [cH. 49

Tuesday, the 9th October, 1705 /2nd Rajab, got an addition
of 500 zat to his rank of 3-hazari. The Emperor learnt that
Durgadas Rathor, who had left the army of Shah ‘Alijah,
had returned. He was ordered to be restored to the rank of
3-hazari (2-hazar tr.).

I shall now turn to the siege of Wagin-gera. The inter-
vening space was covered in three months and a few days,
and on Thursday, the 8th February, 1705/4th Shawwal,
the army arrived near it. Chin Qalich Khan Bahadur, son
of Khan Firuz Jang, nazim of Bijapur and jagirdar of this
country, who had hastened with the advanced detachment
by command, took up a position a quarter of a kos from the
fort, in company with Muhammad Amin Khan Bahadur,
Tarbiyat Khan: Bahadur and the officers of the artillery.
The Emperor’s camp (daira) was located at a distance of a
kos. Everyday the enemy sallied forth and fought the
imperialists. And as some thousand active musketeers and
vigorous troopers, Hindu and Muslim, mostly of the Sayyid
and other tribes, and servants of the best of Khalifas were
opposed to them, severe struggles took place. The big guns
from the top of the hill caused tumultuous slaughter; rockets
followed each other vehemently. One morning Chin Qalich
Khan Bahadur, Muhammad Amin Khan [499] Bahadur,
Tarbiyat Khan Bahadur, ‘Aziz Khan Ruhila, and Ikhlas
Khan Miana, on the look out for opportunities, seized a
hillock named Lal Tikri, the capture of which would greatly
weaken the enemy. ‘The enemy learning of it, came in a
large body, and so stoned the occupants of the hillock that
they could not stand. The heroes waited for an opportunity
~to encircle the infantry. But the work did not prosper and
they turned back. Although Kam Bakhsh and the Amir-
ul-umara were sent, the efforts of the warriors did not
succeed. The Emperor after the retreat ordered them to
give up the endeavour from that side and try to promote the
work from other sides.

That day, when Chin Qalich Khan Bahadur and Muham-
mad Amin Khan Bahadur were riding out with a party to
select the places for the trenches, by chance a cannon-ball fell
upon them. Two legs of the horse of one and a foreleg of the
horse of the other were blown away ; but the two generals got
down in safety. The Emperor on hearing of it sent with his
personal (servant) Amir Khan two Arab horses with gold
saz for the two generals and one precious perfumed pastile
of amber for Chin Qalich Khan and gratified them, In


--- Page 308 ---
1705] SIEGE OF WAGINGERA PRESSED 297

short, the heroes planned to run trenches between Lal Tikri
and the hillock opposite the petta and Dhedapur, Muhammad
Amin Khan Bahadur established an outpost for repelling
the enemy between Lal Tikri and the place of the trenches.
Sultan Husain, surnamed Malang, with the men of the
Prince kept his hold on the conquered hillock for some time.
[500] And similarly, Baqr Khan, son of Ruhullah Khan
boldly maintained himself long on another hillock. These
two parties encountered the enemy day and night, and
checked their assault. In spite of the daily crowding of the
enemy against these men, it seemed likely for the work to
succeed soon, when the news spread that the Marathas were
coming to aid the enemy. On Thursday, the 8th March,
1705 /28rd Zil. Q. Dhana Jadav and Hindu Rao with five
or six thousand troopers arrived near the imperial army.
As the families of many (of them) were living in the protec-
tion of this fort, they kept the imperial army in play, and
carried off the families by the other side of the hill. They
advised the chief of Wagingera thus,—‘‘With all our joint
armies and materials, you and we cannot oppose the
Emperor. If your hill be of iron, it would be dissolved and
if your fort be of brass, it would be overthrown by him.
Don’t ruin your country. Don’t overthrow your zamindari.
Don’t rely too much on your remaining property. Save your
army from being scattered.’’ Regarding the Marathas as
his helpers in his evil day, he had kept them attached to him
by means of a daily subsidy of some thousands of rupees.
The money went out of the purse of this luckless man, but
what came from them (the Marathas) in return? The
Marathas at his instigation, appeared on some occasions from
the various sides of the camp, but being broken they fled to
the hills. Several times great feats were performed through
the forward movement of Muhammad Amin Khan Bahadur,
Hamiduddin Khan Bahadur, Amanullah Khan [501] and
other heroes. In the meantime, the rebel chief made over-
tures for peace. He gave a letter containing a prayer for
safety and some other requests to ‘Abdul Ghani Kashmiri,
a hawking grocer, who had no (merchandise) under his arm
save fraud and duplicity and had attained to (influence on)
the chief by tricks and deception. As that unclean fellow
was not one of the grandees known to the Emperor, he
brought the letter to Hedayetkesh, the general news-reader,
who had once had an occasion to speak to him and said,
‘‘T had gone to take a walk towards the fort, and was delayed

38


--- Page 309 ---
298 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI [cx. 49

by having to perform the evening prayer. At that time
some men of the Berad Chief arrived and carried me away
bound. He after some inquiry wrote and gave me this
letter’’.

. Hedayetkesh reported the matter to the Emperor, who
in spite of his prudence, experience, the indications of the
approaching end of the siege, and knowledge of the worth of
that worthless fellow, said that the prayers would be
granted. The Prince was ordered to be the mediator for
these affairs. The rebel chief sent to the Court his brother
Som Singh, who desired the zamindari, the name of Pidia
and a mansab for him; he got rewards and a mansab on
coming. Muhatasham Khan, son of Shaikh Mir, a debtor
of the Kashmiri, who was living without a mansab and
making no exertions (in the siege) and had been through
the deception of that unclean creature appointed as qiladar,
was taken inside the fort with some men after being given a
mansab. [502] Som Singh spread the tale that Pidia had
turned mad and fled from the fort. The Kashmiri brought
a message from his mother that the wretch had fled with the
Maratha devils, that Som Singh might now be permitted to
come to the fort and engage in the duties of zamindar, and
that the fort would be vacated in a week. It was done: The
KasHmiri was given a mansab of 3-hundred. Hedayetkesh
for a few days got the title of Hadi Khan and promotion.
The fire of the trenches was stopped. The generals were
summoned to Court. As the deceiver had imagined that
according to his fraud and promises the Emperor would
march away and his jugglery and hypocrisy would succeed
but the affair did not result as he had expected,—he delayed
in evacuating the fort and admitting the imperialists, and
opened the door of disturbance with the desire of fighting.
He knew not what enormous materials for ensuring the
success of the work the Emperor had kept in view during
the negotiations for peace and what mass of water had been
poured [by him on the tree of] his object during the few
days that the fire of slaughter was extinguished !

To put it shortly, in this interval of delay Bakhshi-ul-
mulk Zulfiqar Khan Bahadur Nasrat Jang who had been
ordered to come to Court from Burhanpur with treasure,
quickly arrived with Rao Dalpat, Ram Singh and a strong
force ; Daud Khan who was acting at Jinji as naib of Nasrat
Jang arrived speedily with Bahadur Khan and a large party ;
Yusuf Khan, qiladar of Qamarnagar and Kamyab Khan


--- Page 310 ---
1705] BERADS EVACUATE WAGIN-GERA 299

[503] qiladar of Gulbarga and other faujdars and qiladars
with excellent corps arrived. The Emperor ordered Nasrat
Jang to capture the fort and punish the enemy. The day
following the interview, the Khan went to view the fort on
the side of the hillock of Sultan Husain and Baqr Khan.
The enemy firing muskets from their perches in the petta,
advanced to fight, and were beaten, many being slain, and
the rest fleeing to their holes, and firmly holding the wall
of the petta. In this day’s fight many of the followers of
Rao Dalpat, after fighting valiantly, were slain or wounded.
Jamshid Khan Bijapuri was killed by a cannon-ball. Nasrat
Jang firmly planted himself a short distance from that wall.
By order Hamiduddin Khan Bahadur, Tarbiyat Khan
Bahadur and others joined Nasrat Jang. Chin Qalich Khan
sat down between the trenches and Lal Tikri to punish the
enemy. After a few days he was ordered to patrol round
the fort with Muhammad Amin Khan and other Mughals,
and Bakhshi-ul-mulk Mirza Sadruddin Muhammad Khan
Safavi, to keep his place hot for him. Meantime Nasrat Jang
had captured some wells situated on the skirt of the hill
whence the enemy used to draw water, and by setting up
palisades (katgara) and making head-covers (? ‘‘tortoises’’
or wide shields), had come close to the wall. ‘Till at last on
Friday, the 27th April, 1705/14th Muharram [504] relying
on God and the Emperor, he appointed for the assault Daud
Khan with his brothers from one side, and Hamiduddin
Khan Bahadur, Tarbiyat Khan Bahadur and other heroes
from another ; while he himself stood on horseback to support
them. The heroes, eager for honour, ran on foot from both
sides; the enemy who fought while fleeing could not resist
the onset. Vacating the pettah they fled to the fort. The
victors, traversing the ups and downs for one kos on foot,
slaying and breaking the enemy, firmly established them-
selves. When the accursed Berads and Marathas saw these
victories, the Berad chief knew that he had no refuge save
in flight, and stationing a body of musketeers to check the
imperialists during the day, fled out of the other side of the
hill with the Marathas, the companions of his days of
adversity. Towards evening the party of musketeers set
fire to the houses and property (man) and fled. The
conflagration and the disappearance of the unfortunates
revealed the real circumstance. Daud Khan, Mansur
Khan, and others ran towards the chief’s house, and found
it empty. Before his flight he had confined Muhtasham


--- Page 311 ---
300 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRi / fou. 49

Khan in his house. After the conquest of the fort the
door [505] was opened to the Khan. This great victory
fell to the lot of Nasrat Jang through the grace and good
fortune of the Emperor.

Next day, when Nasrat Jang interviewed the Emperor
he was rewarded with a jewelled sword, a horse with gold
saz and an elephant with silver accoutrements; Daud Khan
with a sword and a horse; his brother Bahadur Khan with
an increment of 100 tr. and the granting of kettledrums ;
Rao Dalpat was rewarded by the promotion of his sons, and
Ram Singh by an increment of 500. Hamiduddin Khan
Bahadur’s exertions were rewarded with an increment of
300 tr. and a special robe, and those of Tarbiyat Khan Baha-
dur with an increment of 200 tr. and the granting of naubat;
Matlab Khan and Amanullah Khan each received an in-
crement of 200 tr. and the naubat. Saifullah, Khan, Mir
Tuzuk, who was that day wounded in the arm with a
musket-ball, received 100 mohars. Next day Amir Khan
(close to the Emperor’s person), Bakhshi-ul-mulk Mirza
Sadruddin Muhammad Khan (Safavi), and ‘Inayetullah
Khan, the chief of ministers, each received a promotion of
500. Khwaja ‘Ambar got the title of Khidmatgar Khan,
Khwaja Bakhtawar the title of Khan and [506] each
of them got an increment of a 100 zat (5 tr.).
Qazi Akram Khan became, by an increment of 100, a hazart,
Chin Qalich Khan Bahadur and Muhammad Amin Khan
Bahadur, who had gone to patrol in the neighbourhood,
done excellent work, and worked hard in the pursuit of the
enemy, were summoned to Court after the enemy’s escape.
The first by an increment of hazar zat became a 5-hazari
(same tr.) and received 1 kror and 50 lakh dam as in‘am,
an enamelled sword, and an elephant. ‘The second received
a sword and the increment of 500, which made him a
4-hazari (1,200 tr.). Sayyid Sarfaraz Khan was given back
the 500 tr. formerly deducted, and thus became a 6-hazarit
(5,000 tr.), and also received a special robe and 1,000 mohars
as reward. Faridun Khan and Hasan Khan, sons of
Jamshid Khan deceased, received, the first 500 zat (300 tr.),
the second 500 (200 tr.) as increment, and thus each became
a 14-hazari.. Mughals and other clans, Hindu and Muslim,
of the forces of the two Khan Bahadurs, were favoured with
promotion, horses, swords, and daggers.

In short, a great celebration was made for the victory.
The Muslims universally rejoiced. The peasants and

1705] EMPEROR ENCAMPS A’t DEWAPUR 301

commonalty, the high people and Sayyids of this country
became composed and happy at the extirpation of the
wicked infidel. The fort was renamed Rahman-Bakhsh
Khera.

[507] THE STAY OF THE ARMY AT DEWAPUR.

As the chief object of conquering this country was to
spread Islamic practices in an infidels’ land and to improve
the condition of all the slaves, Chin Qalich Khan was sent
with a portion of the army to hasten and settle the neigh-
bourhood, reassure and compose the ryots, who had fled
far away in terror and hidden themselves, and send messages
of their being treated with justice and favour, in order to
induce them to return to their old homes and engage in
cultivation (again): and to exact tributes from some re-
fractory chiefs or to punish them. In view of furthering
these works, the return of the timid inhabitants to Rahman-
Bakhsh-Khera, the building of a fort and a mosque here,
and the passing of the rainy season, the Emperor ordered
that some place should be selected in the neighbourhood
which was suitable for the imperial camp. The officers
chose Dewapur, 3 kos from .Rahman-Bakhsh-Khera, near
the Krishna. The Emperor reached the place in one march.
It was a truly charming seat, the cause of comfort and re-
pose to the people. Thanks to the Emperor, repose was
enjoyed. During the stay here, the tributes that had been
collected reached the Emperor; the peasantry returned to
their homes and engaged in tillage; the rebels were
chastised. Under the supervision of Khwaja Mas‘aud
Mahalli, a strong fort and a beautiful mosque were built,
the superintendent being rewarded with the title of Mas‘aud
Khan. At this time, [508] Bakhshenda-Bakhsh Kondana,
having been recovered by the enemy through the cowardice
of the qiladar and the tricks of the enemy, the Emperor
sent Hamiduddin Khan Bahadur and Tarbiyat Khan
Bahadur with a party of heroes, after favouring them with
proper promotions and rewards and helping them with
money, to hasten there.

ACCOUNT OF THE EMPEROR’S ILLNESS

Owing to the fickleness of fortune, every soundness of
health is closely linked to some kind of illness, and every
happiness goes hand in hand with some misery. At this time,


--- Page 313 ---
302 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRI [cH. 49

when the people had acquired a little repose, suddenly a
strange disorder and bewildering distress took place, owing
to the illness of the Emperor who was the life of the world
and the cause of the repose of men, * * *

At first His Majesty, through his natural strength of
mind and firmness of purpose, did not allow himself to be
overcome by the disease, and so did not give up the tran-
saction of business, but sometimes like the sun in the
eastern sky, he showed his face at the small door of the
Court (of Justice). The prayers of men reached his
knowledge through the medium of petitions and letters, and
he used to write suitable answers firmly with his own hand.
Thereafter, through the severity of the illness and the
increase of the pain, extreme depression seized him, and at
times he became unconscious. It seemed likely, that through
this terrible [509] occurrence, the kingdom and the faith
would break up. The people preferred their own death to
their lives, but could not get it (death). Great agitation
seized the camp. Wild and heart-sickening rumours began
to spread. Fools formed the unlucky ambition of boldly
practising oppression in this disorderly country, where the
enemy lay in ambush everywhere in search of opportunities.

For ten'or twelve days this state continued; till at last
the life-giver of the world breathed new lives into the bodies
of the frightened people; and the removal of the Emperor’s
illness gave peace and safety to the world. The turbulent
enemy and evil-natured wrong-doers scattered the dust of
despair on their heads. Amir Khan used to narrate, ‘‘One
day in extreme pain the Emperor muttered,

‘By the time you reach your 80th or 90th year,

You will have met with many afflictions from Time
(or Fortune) ;

And when from that point you reach the stage of
a hundred years,

Death will assume the shape of your life.’

The low moan reached my ears, I quickly said to him
‘Peace be with Your Majesty! Shaikh Ganja has composed
all these couplets merely as the preface to the following
couplet :—

‘Then, it is better for you to be cheerful,
For in cheerfulness you can remember God!’


--- Page 314 ---
1705] EMPEROR’S RECOVERY, RETURN MARCH 303

The Emperor said ‘Recite again’. I recited it a
number of times. He ordered me to show it written. I
did so. He read it for a time. The Giver of mercy to the
helpless, the Remover of the pain of troubled hearts,
bestowed strength on the Cause of the world’s comfort, and
[510] next morning the Emperor came to the Court of the
oppressed. The people got back their lives. The Emperor
said ‘Your couplet gave me perfect recovery and brought
wonderful strength to my weak heart’. The methods
which doctor Hiziq Khan employed in the Emperor’s treat-
ment were worthy of the ancient doctors. Praised be God,
and again praised be God! This lucky man was, in reward
of his excellent services, weighed against gold and presented
with a sarpech. The Emperor after gaining relief from the
use of China root (Smilax China) which had done great good
to his constitution, sent away, to guard his own subah,
Chin Qalich Khan Bahadur, who in excess of agitation had
quickly reached the camp. On Tuesday the 23rd October,
1705 /16th Rajab, the Emperor set out for Bahadurgarh in
a palki (takht). The rest of this month (Rajab) and the
whole of the next (Shaban) were spent in the journey. On
the way, Qazi Akram Khan died. He was unparallelled
in legal knowledge and uprightness. The Emperor in
recognition of his merits used to speak of him under the
name of ‘the late most learned man’.

50TH YEAR OF THE REIGN: 1117 A. H.
6th December, 1705—25th November, 1706.

* * * [511] On Thursday the 6th December, 1705 /1st
Ramzan the imperial camp reached Bahadurgarh. As the
officers, appointed to recover Bakhshenda-Bakhsh had only
made a tour and circuit and putting off the accomplishment
of their purpose to another time, had returned to Court,
Zulfiqar Khan Bahadur Nasrat Jang, who after the capture
of Rahman-Bakhsh-Khera had been sent towards Auranga-
bad in pursuit of the thieves, was summoned to Court, and
had interview at Bahadurgarh.

On the 28rd January 1706/19th Shawwal* when the
imperial army began its march for Ahmadnagar, the Khan
(Nasrat Jang) after being suitably favoured, was sent against
Bakhshenda-Bakhsh. In addition to his own troops,
Tarbiyat Khan Bahadur, zil‘adar of this quarter, obeyed
orders (by joining Nasrat Jang). Shahu, son of the
infidel Sambha, who was residing within the gulalbar, was
ordered to accompany the army of Nasrat Jang. On Friday
the 25th January, 1706/21st Shawwal, for some political
reasons, his tent was ordered to be pitched close to the daira
of the Khan and he was presented with a special robe and
two costly udraj. The imperial camp returned to Ahmad-
nagar, after the lapse of 22 years, on Sunday, 20th
January /16th Shawwal. [512]

On Thursday the 21st March, 1706/17th Zil. H. in-
formants reported to the Emperor that Nasrat Jang had
recaptured Bakhshenda-Bakhsh, and expelled the beaten
garrison without arms and accoutrements. Prince ‘Alijah,
who had been engaged in governing Gujrat, on hearing of
the Emperor’s illness, had in his excess of love and devotion
applied for permission to come to Court. By order, he
arrived and had audience on the 25th March, 1706/21st
Zil. H. Bidar Bakht was ordered to put down the enemy
who had spreaditowards the province of Gujrat, on account
of the delay in the arrival of Ibrahim Khan who had been

transferred from Kashmir to the Subahdari of Gujrat. In
the place of the Shahzada, the subahdarship of Burhanpur
was entrusted to Najabat Khan, and the defence of Malwa
to Khan-i-‘Alam. News reached the Emperor from Delhi
that Gauharara Begam, his younger sister, had died. He
was [513] deeply grieved, and repeatedly said, ‘‘Of the
children of Shah Jahan, she and I alone were left’’. * * *

He gratified her dependants with many kinds of con-
solation and favour. He appointed Hafiz Khan, her
mirsaman, as diwan of Lahore vice Muhammad Aslam
Khan. Sayyid Muhammad, grandson of Qazi Muhammad
Aslam deceased who was the Emperor’s ustad, was appointed
Sadr of the same Subah. Khwaja Zakria and Khwaja
Yahya, sons of Sarbuland Khan Khwaja Musa and
daughter’s sons of Prince Muhammad Mu‘izzudin, had
audience and received robes and cash gifts. Tarbiyat Khan
Bahadur’s daughter received ornaments worth 4,000 rupees
to the delight of her father. Chin Qalich Khan Bahadur
became faujdar of Firuz-Nagar vice Yusuf Khan, and also
faujdar of Talikota vice Qudratullah Khan. Muhammad
Muhasan, brother’s son of Bakhshi-ul-mulk Mirza Safavi
Khan having newly come from Persia, interviewed the
Emperor. Amat-ul-Hamid, daughter of Hamiduddin
Khan Bahadur was presented with ornaments worth 2,000
rupees. Sarafraz Khan, a 6-hazdri (5-hazdr tr.) was re-
warded for the pursuit of Pidia Naik with the increment of
a hazar troopers. Jagia, deshmukh of Nasratabad, a
24-hazari (1,500 tr.) received an increment of [514] 5-sadz.
Mulla Haidar, wstad of Muhammad ‘Azim, and Qazi of
Delhi, had been summoned to Court to be made Qazi of the
imperial camp. He now arrived and got the high post.
At Nasrat Jang’s request, the zamindari of Mau-maidana
was given to his officer Raja Ram Singh Hada vice Rao
Budh Singh. This Emperor, so gracious in the material
and spiritual spheres alike, had been permitted by Shaikh
Abdul Latif, the chief of saints, to put away from himself
the surname of Abul Faiyaz (‘‘the father of bounties’’), and
now, out of kindness and favour to ‘Alijah, that prince was
directed by His Majesty to add this title to his own
name.*

got an increment of 500 zat (200tr.). The enemy who
were commanded to be henceforth written of as ‘thieves’,
appeared two kos from the camp. The Emperor ordered
Khan-i-‘Alam, Bakhshi-ul-mulk Sadruddin Muhammad
Khan Safavi, and others to go and chastise them. A‘s they,
in the thick of the battle, sent reports of the numerical
superiority of the enemy to the Emperor, he sent
Hamiduddin Khan Bahadur and Matlab Khan to their aid,
after presenting them with amulets for safety. The enemy
were beaten back. Khan-i-‘Alam and Munawwar Khan
were sent to Shah ‘Alijah, with the present of swords.
[515] A ring set with an emerald, carved with the name of
Chin Qalich Khan Bahadur was sent to him. Baqi Khan,
qiladar of Agra, a 2-hazari (600 tr.), got an increment of
500 zat, and said in gratitude,—

‘“The work succeeds through the Emperor’s favour ;
Baqi (1, he and 2, the rest) is a mere pretext (as the doer
of it)!’’

Gaitiara Begam and ‘Iffat-ara Begam, daughters of
Shah ‘Alijah, and Bakht-un-nisa Begam, daughter of Bidar
Bakht, came to Court : each.was presented with ornaments

presented with forty lakhs of dam. The Crown Prince sent
the robe of appointment for the post of his Court agent to
Muhammad Ikhlas-kesh, (whose name, through the grace
of the Emperor had been prefaced by the holy word
‘Muhammad’ and thus rendered famous as Muhammad
Ikhlas), and the latter made his bow to the Emperor.

Mehtar Mubarak, messenger of the king of Balkh,
had audience, and presented as peshkash, twelve horses and
five mules. Two dalis of robes, an elephant, and a horse

1707] AURANGZIB’S ILLNESS AND DEATH 309

January, 1706/16th Shawwal [520] he alighted at Ahmad-
nagar. After one year of residence there, owing to the
fickleness of fortune, he fell severely ill at the end of the
month of Shawwal of the 51st regnal year (26th December,
1706—238rd January, 1707). But * * he recovered from the
illness. According to his usual custom, he came to the
‘‘Court of the oppressed’’ several times and engaged in the
business of the State. In the course of this time, Shah
‘Alijah was sent to remedy the disorders of the subah of
Malwa, and Kam Bakhsh started for Bijapur as Subahdar.
After a space of four or five days, a severe fever attacked
His Majesty, and for three days, although the severity of it
continued, he by exerting his natural strength of purpose
and loftiness of spirit came to the Court (‘adalatgah) at every
one of the five hours of prayer, for the purpose of offering
his prayers with the congregation, reciting God’s name and
performing (other) religious duties; and he did not neglect
a single item (of worship). In these days he frequently
recited this couplet :

‘In a twinkle, in a minute, in a breath,
The condition of the world changes.”’

[521] In the afternoon of Thursday, the Emperor was
shown a petition of Hamiduddin Khan Bahadur proposing
the giving away of an elephant as tasadduq, and begging
that 4,000 rupees, the price of the elephant, might be
entrusted to the Qazi-ul-qazat Mulla Haidar for distribution
among the poor. The Emperor wrote the letter sad
(‘correct’) on it. On the top (of the sheet), while he was in
a condition which was almost that of the parting of life, he
wrote ‘‘Convey this worthless person (khaksdar) to the first
stage’. On the morning of Friday, the 20th February,
1707 /28th Zil. Q. 1118, the Emperor came out and went
to his bed-room (khabgah) to perform his morning prayer,
and engaged in reciting God’s names, and in spite of his
being overcome by unconsciousness and difficulty of breath-
ing, his fingers moved in counting the beads of the rosary and
(his tongue) in repeating the phrase ‘‘There is no deity save
God’’. When nearly one quarter of the day was over, in
accordance with his own wish,—he used to say that it is a
great boon to die on a Friday,—he passed away. * * *

The Qazi, scholars, and pious men engaged in furnish-
ing and shrouding his corpse for burial, in the terms of his

310 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRi (ox. 5]

last will, [522] performed the funeral prayer, and kept his
body in the khabgah, till at last at the request of Zinat-un-
nisa Began, second daughter of the Emperor, Prince
Muhammad ‘Azam, who had been halting twenty-five kos
from the imperial camp, arrived on Saturday, the 22nd
February, 1707/30th Zil. Q., and went into the deepest
mourning.

On Monday, the 24th February, the Prince in extreme
grief carried the corpse on his own shoulders up to the hall
of justice, by way of escorting it reverently, and then sent
itaway. According to His Majesty’s last will, he was buried
in the courtyard of the tomb of Shaikh Zainuddin [at Rauza,
near Daulatabad] in a sepulchre built by the Emperor in
his own lifetime. * * *

[523] This place, called Khuldabad, is eight kos from
Aurangabad and three kos from Daulatabad. The red stone
platform (chabutra) over his grave, not exceeding three
yards in length, two and a half yards in breadth, and a few
fingers in height, has a cavity in the middle. It has been
filled with earth, in which fragrant herbs have been planted.
* * * He is (now) remembered under the title of Khuld-
makan.

Through the numberless blessings of the angelic soul
of this repository of Divine pardon, (after his death) not a
trace appeared of those disturbances and ruin which descend
on mankind during world-convulsing changes, and so the
people reposed on the cushion of comfort exactly as they had
passed their days in peace and happiness during the lifetime
of this ever-living soul. God’s pardon and mercy be on him!
The period of his life was 91 years and 13 days (lunar) and
that of his reign 50 years, 2 months and 27 days. It is
impossible for me to say anything that can truly number
the years of this Unique One of the Celestial Court. What
can we speak of the life of a man who has been gifted with
the life eternal? For ever-awake hearts like him, it is the
rule to avoid the word ‘death’. Verses :—

The pious have never died and will never die.
When applied to such men the name of death is
properly speaking ‘translation’.


--- Page 322 ---
1707] HALLOWED MEMORY OF AURANGZIB 311

That passionate pursuer of perfection, Muhammad
Ikhlas (kesh) used to narrate, ‘In the night preceding that
Friday on which [524] His Majesty went to visit the garden
of divine pardon, ‘Inayetullah Khan and myself were dis-
tracted and depressed in mind and body at the imminence of
such a great calamity; we took sorts by opening the poems
of ‘the Tongue of the Invisible’ (the Diwdn-i-Hafiz) at
haphazard and our eyes fell on the following ghazal :—

So long as any trace or name of the tavern and
the wine will remain (on earth),
My head will be the dust on the road of the Magi.
On the soil that will bear the mark of the sole
of thy foot,
For years to come masters of sight (truly-sighted
men) will prostrate themselves in adoration.
When thou passest by my tomb, cheer up,
It will be a place of pilgrimage to the drunkards
of the world ( = Sufis).

‘Despair seized our souls, we passed the night in dis-
traction of mind and anguish of heart. Next morning when
one watch (three hours) of the day was over, the inevitable
event took place. The night of the following Saturday (i.e.,
the night of the Friday, according to the Christian almanac)
we came together again. Mulla Haidar, the Qazi of the
imperial army, arrived as a guest; we told him that we had
taken sorts out of the Diwdn-i-Hafiz. However much we
tried, we could not recollect the verses.

We called for our books, but our baggage had been
already packed up. Our company broke up. I fell asleep,
when I dreamt that I was passing by a grave; a holy man
(Hazrat) appeared with half his body standing out of the
grave; he spoke to me,

‘The verses you have forgotten are these—
When thou passest by my tomb, cheer up,
It will be a place of pilgrimage to the drunkards
( = Sufis) of the world.’ ”’

Verses.

He never dies whose heart is (ever) awake with love.
My eternity has been inscribed on the pages of the world,

[525] The noble character of this perfect Sovereign.
As his blessed nature dictated, he was characterized by
perfect devotion to the rites of the Faith; he followed the
teaching of the great Imam Abu Hanifa (God be pleased
with him!), and established and enforced to the best of his
power the five foundations of Islam (five daily prayers). He
was ever performing the purificatory lavation (before prayer)
and repeating the blessed words (of the Prophet) and other
holy sayings and prayers. He used to perform the obliga-
tory prayers for the time (of the day) in the masjid or with-
out a masjid, in congregation, and all the sunnan and
nawafil and the dearly loved (mustahabbat) ceremonies
publicly and with perfect humility. Fasting every month
on the 12th and 13th days from the new moon (the brightest
days), every week on Monday, Thursday and Friday, he
used to perform the Friday prayer in the congregation
mosque (Jam’i) in the company of all the Muslims and the
community of the faithful.

The sacred nights he used to pass in wakefulness. With
the light of the grace of God, he kindled the lamp of the
church and the State. In his excessive quest of truth, in the
sanctum sanctorum of the mosque of his royal residence,
at nights he held converse with the men of God. In his
private chamber, he never reposed on a cushion (masnaa).
He used to pay the canonical zakat (contribution to the poor
of 24 per cent every year) on the income that he had drawn
and spent for his own food and clothing before his accession,
in ways which were free from scruple or doubt, and what-
ever during his kingship he had added to the former by
setting apart certain villages of Delhi and two or three salt-
producing mahals for his privy purse; calculating the zakat
on the income of his royal sons also, he used to send the
amounts to the needy. The blessed month of Ramzan [526]
he spent in fasting (in the day-time), and to the very end
of that month he used to remain busy up to midnight in per-
forming the Sunnan prayer and the tarawih* and in chanting
the entire Quran in full congregation along with crowds of
pious and learned men. On the 10th day of the month of
Muharram (‘Ashurah), he resided in the mosque in con-
tinual prayer. The performance of the ceremonies pres-
cribed for the pilgrimage to Mecca—which was an obligation
of the faith and the goal of his heart’s desire—had outwardly

* Twenty or more genuflexions made after the last prayer of Ramzan.

to be postponed by him owing to certain obstructions and
difficulties; but in order to atone for it, he conferred so
many favours (money) on the pilgrims going to the two Holy
Cities that it was equivalent to the Great Hajj itself. And
during his reign he used to send large amounts of money,
for some years annually, at others once in two or three years,
to the pious men living in retreat in those Holy Cities, and
a large number of men in those holy places were permanently
employed by him on daily stipends to act as his deputies in
walking round the Ka‘ba, bowing (to the Prophet’s tomb),
reading the two copies of the Quran written by this pious
Emperor with his own hand and presented to Medina, count-
ing the beads, repeating the Islamic credo and performing
other acts of worship.

The characteristic qualities of scholars and the morals
of perfect men, as they ought to be, were truly found in this
Emperor of angelic character. His Majesty from the dawn-
ing of his understanding, being fully aware of the [canoni-
cal] duties and prohibitions, out of the perfect continence
of his passions, never partook of any thing except the cano-
nically sanctioned pleasures.

All the agents of pleasure and entertainment, such as
sweet-voiced singers or charming players on musical instru-
ments, were gathered in large numbers round his throne,
and in the first few years of his reign he occasionally listened
to their music and had a perfect expert’s knowledge of this
art ; yet out of extreme abstinence he [later on] totally gave
up listening to music [527]..

Those of the court chanters, singers and musicians
who repented of their sinful art, he made happy by the grant
of daily stipends and land as ‘‘aid to living’’. Mirza Mukar-
ram Khan Safavi, who was an expert in the musical art,
once said to His Majesty ‘‘What is Your Majesty’s view of
music?’? The Emperor answered (in Arabic) ‘‘It is
mubah,* neither good nor bad’’. The Khan asked, ‘’Then
what kind of it is in your opinion most worthy to be heard ?’”’
The Emperor replied, ‘‘I cannot listen to music without
flutes, (be-mazamir) especially pakhawaj, but that is un-
animously prohibited (hardm); so I have left off hearing
singing too’. |

* Mubah, literaliy ‘allowed’, i.e., an action which a person, according

to the Muslim Canon law, may do or let alone, it being attended with
neither praise nor blame; indifferent. (Encyclopaedia of Islam, iv. 322.) —

He never wore garments declared impure by the Canon
[such as robes of unmixed silk yarn], and not at all used
vessels of gold or silver. In his company, no improper
word such as of slander or obscenity or falsehood was
spoken. His courtiers were instructed that when speaking
or reading they should substitute some elegant word for
every word that had any suspicion of being objectionable.
Out of his love for doing justice, everyday, with open fore-
head and tender heart, he used to stand up two or three
times, and grant justice to plaintiffs who used to find access
in crowds without any obstruction to his court of justice and
owing to the excessive kindness of His Majesty, used to
state their plaints without the least fear or despair: and
if in pleading their suits, they used any bombast (hyperbole
in praise or censure) or exaggeration (or straining any point)
of language or wrong pronunciation (or wrong expression),
he did not at all get angry, and no lowering of anybody’s
dignity was ever seen on His Majesty’s part. Many
times his courtiers urged him to prevent (the plaintiffs) from
displaying too much boldness (of speech). But he used to
reply ‘‘From hearing [528] such words and the occurrence
of such cases, the (sovereign’s) character acquires an angelic
patience’’. Never did he do any act which was without bene-
fit to the populace. The tribe of harlots was expelled from
Delhi, and the same order was published in all the provinces
and all sides of the imperial dominions.

The work of the Censor of Morals was carried out to
the full among the general public, both high and low. In
administering such a vast empire he never had recourse to
any punishment except the hadud and siydasat authorized by
the Islamic Holy Law (Shara‘) and never issued an order
for the killing of a man through the force of anger or the
vehemence of passion, and none else had the power to do
such deeds. By reason of his recognition of the dignity of
others and his appreciation of merit, he used to honour
Sayyids, Shaikhs and learned scholars (ulama). Through
the auspices of this hearty endeavour, the Hanafi creed (i.e.,
the Orthodox Sunni faith) has gained such strength and
currency in the great country of Hindustan as was never
seen in the times of any of the preceding sovereigns. By one
stroke of the pen, the Hindu clerks (writers) were dismissed
from the public employment. Large numbers of the places
of worship of the infidels and great temples of these wicked
people have been thrown down and desolated. Men who can

1707] AURANGZIB PROMOTED ISLAM 315

see only the outside of things are filled with wonder at the
successful accomplishment of such a seemingly, difficult task.
And on the sites of the temples lofty mosques have been
built. His Majesty personally taught the credo to many
of the infidels who came to him, guided by their good for-
tune, with a view to being converted to Islam, and he best-
owed on them robes of honour and other [529] favours.
About the middle of his reign he decided to levy the
jaziya tax on the Hindus, as ordained by the Shara‘ and it
was enforced throughout his empire; and this rare piece of
good work (hasnat-i-gharib) had not been done in Hindustan
and the Hindus had not been degraded to such a degree in
any other period. He used to spend so much money in reli-
gious alms (khairdt), beneficent public works, (like the
building of public inns, mubarrat), and pensions (idrarat),
that the expenditure of former rulers had not reached even a
hundredth part of it: In the blessed month of Ramzan he
used to distribute among the needy 60,000 rupees and in
other months smaller amounts than that. Numerous free
kitchens (balghurkhanah or langar khanah) for feeding the
weak and the poor were established in Delhi and other pro-
vinces ; wherever there was no inn or sarai for the accom-
modation of travellers before, they were built by him. The
repair of (old) mosques throughout the empire was carried
out at the expense of his Government, and they were also
supplied with a staff of imam, mu‘azzin and khatib (for
each), so that a huge amount of money was spent on this
work. In all the cities and regions of this vast kingdom,
he assigned adequate subsistence-allowances in the form of
daily stipends and land grants (imla@k) to (Islamic) scholars
and teachers, and provided food-money (cost of maintenance)
for their students according to their condition and number,
All the aim of his exalted heart was devoted to making
the general Muslim public act according to the legal deci-
sions and precedents of the theological scholars (ulama) of
the Hanafi school ; but seeing that these rulings as found in
the existing law-books were confused (lit. mixed) on account
of the diversity of opinion among the qazis and muftis and
the weakness (i.e., little weight or authority) of the tradi-
tions, and the contradictory nature of the declarations of
those ancient authorities—and above all as these rulings were
not embodied in one book, so that till many law books were
[580] collected and men (in India) could acquire adequate
mastery of the science of jurisprudence, it was impossible to

make a correct extract (of the Quranic precept applicable to
the particular case),—(therefore) the heart of this Emperor,
the asylum of the Faith, was set on this that a syndicate of
celebrated theologians and well-known scholars of Hindu-
stan should go through the long authoritative books on juris-
prudence, which had been collected in the imperial library,
extract the rulings of muftis, and compile one comprehen-
sive book out of them all, so that all may find out the autho-
ritative rulings (on their cases) with ease. This great work
was entrusted to a board presided over by that highest of
scholars Shaikh Nizam (of Bhagalpur in Bihar) and all the
scholars engaged in the work were given good pay and sub-
sistence. About two lakhs of rupees were spent in preparing
this book, which was entitled the Fatawa-i-‘Alamgiri, and
which rendered the world independent of all other books on
jurisprudence.

Among His Majesty’s many favours to the public was
the abolition of the taxes on grain and other food-stuffs, the
charge for road-patrols (rahdari), the excise duty on cloth
and other articles subject to the sair (octroi), especially the
duty on tobacco, which last article yielded a vast revenue
and the excise-officers used to practise astonishing outrages
on the modesty of women* in searching their persons, under
the suspicion of its being smuggled.

Another of his gracious concessions was the remission
throughout his dominions (of certain cesses)+ on the Mus-
lims in particular and the aforesaid items on the people in
general, the total annual yield of which taken together ex-
ceeded thirty lakhs of rupees. He also abolished the rule of
realising from his mansabdars the unspent Government ad-
vances to their grandfathers and other kinsmen, which under
the standing practice of the finance department used before
his time to be recovered by gradual deduction from the pay of
their mansabs, and credited to the Exchequer, and which
every year brought in a large total. [531] His Majesty also
forbade the practice of escheating to the State the property
of the dead nobles who had left behind them no debt due to
Government, but he let their heirs succeed to their legacy,—
whereas in former reigns the imperial collectors used strictly
to confiscate such property and this rule proved a source of
suffering to the surviving relatives. The Emperor also sent

his farmans to every subah ordering that the taxes (hdaszlat)
should be collected only in accordance with the rules of the
Holy Quranic Law.

The military activities that His Majesty had performed
both before his accession to the throne and after it, have
been embodied in the course of the occurrences described in
this auspicious history. Here I shall write only a little
about the wonderful firmness of His Majesty, which was
witnessed when the imperial army (of Shah Jahan) invaded
Balkh, and ‘Abdul ‘Aziz Khan opposed him in battle. A
hostile force, more numerous than ants and locusts, com-
pletely encircled the imperial army and engaged in fighting ;
in the very heat of the engagement, the time of the zuhar
prayer arrived ; His Majesty disregarding the dissuasions of
his officers, alighted from his mount, adorned the ranks of
prayer in congregation, and performed the namdazes, obli-
gatory, sunnat and nafl, with firmness* and_ perfect
composure of mind. ‘Abdul ‘Aziz Khan, as soon as he
heard of this act of bravery, was overpowered by the force
of the verse ‘‘Help is from God’’, and gave up the fight,
saying, ‘To quarrel with such a man is to ruin one’s self?’.

Among the admirable pursuits of His Majesty, which
adorned him with divinely bestowed conditions (halat-1-
wahabiya, ecstasy?) was his diligent study of religious
books, such as the Commentaries on the Quran, the Tradi-
tions of the Prophet, and works on jurisprudence, [532] the
writings of Imam Muhammad Ghazali: selections from the
books of Shaikh Sharf Yahia of Maner, Shaikh Zain-ud-din,
Qutb Muhi Shirazi, and other books of the same class, which
he perused constantly.

Another of his brilliant characteristics was the menio-
rising of the Word of God : although from the beginning of
his fortunate life he had committed to memory certain of
the chapters (sura) of the Quran as the result of his follow-
ing the guidance of chanters, yet the Quran was completely
memorised by him only after his accession to the throne,
with great exertion and angelic persistence. The date of
his commencing this work of memorising will be found from
the numerical value of the letters in the blessed sentence
Sanqarek—falatansi (=1071 A.H.) and the date of comple-
tion from the phrase Lawh-i-mahfuz (=1078).

State), or (2) with the firmness of pillars. ;

318 MAASIR-I-‘ALAMGIRi (cx. 51

The hand-writing of His Majesty in the naskh style
was exceedingly firm and wellformed, and he showed great
energy in writing it. Two copies of the Holy Quran
transcribed with his own hand—on the tablet (lawh),
marginal lines in gold and silver, and binding of which
7,000 rupees had been spent,—-he had presented to Medina.
He could also write the nastaliq and shikastah hands very
well.

He possessed great skill in prose composition and
letter-writing, and was well-versed in prose and poetry
(literature). But holding firmly to the precept of the holy
verse: “It is the erring who follow the poets’’, (Quran,
xxvi. 224), he did not incline to the hearing of useless
poetry. How then could he be expected to listen to
adulatory verses? But poems breathing moral advice (he

liked). Verses [533].

In order to please God the High and Splendid, I have not
Turned my eyes on any ghazal (fawn-like beauty)
nor my ears on any ghazal (erotic ode).

It is beyond the power of the pen to embrace all the
noble traits of the character of this Choice One of the Age,
and to recount them. (Verses omitted) * * *

ACCOUNT OF THIS HOLY EMPEROR’S CHILDREN

This perfect-natured Sovereign brought up his sons in
such a way that through his outward and inward exertions
they became endowed with high accomplishments and
orthodox learning and came to possess an abundant share
of virtue, submissiveness to God, abstinence from un-
canonical acts, the science and practice of kingship and
generalship, and skill in many useful arts.

Guided by the Emperor, they committed the Quran to
memory and acquired some amount of polite learning (under
twelve heads), gained skill in writing different kinds of
hand, and mastered the Turki and Persian languages. So,
too, all the females of his harem (daughters) under his
direction learnt the necessary rules and doctrines of
religion, and all engaged in the worship of God, reading
and transcribing the Quran, and the acquisition of virtues
and provision for the next world.

1707] EMPEROR SHAH ALAM I 319

The Lord had given His Majesty five sons and five
daughters. [534] Here I shall give a brief account of each
of them, although the affairs of the Emperor’s sons and
daughters have been narrated among the events of the life
of this Emperor in the ‘Alamgirnamah and this history
of mine.

Sons :—l. Prince Muhammad Sultan, borne by
Nawab Bai, 4th Ramzan, 1049/19th December, 1639. He
was noted for his noble manners and admirable qualities;
memorised the Quran, could read and write Arabic, Persian
and Turki sufficiently well. In the wars of His Majesty,
this Prince performed brilliant exertions and gave proofs of
his valour. Died in the 20th year of His Majesty’s reign.

2. Prince Muhammad Mu‘azzam Shah ‘Alam Baha-
dur, born on the last day of Rajab, 1053 /4th October, 1643,
from the womb of the same queen as the above. This epi-
tome of the ‘‘Book of Night and Day’’, owing to his blessed
character and the teaching of His Majesty, from the dawn
of his reason, acquired noble traits of character and manly
accomplishments. When young he memorised the Quran.
He has mastered the art of reading the Quran with the
correct intonation; and he chants the verses with such a
clear melodious voice, that [535] the listener’s ears are
never satiated with hearing it. Before reading the verses,
one verse is [ cor. from ms. | the manzil (? phase, stage)* with
regard to this Chosen One of the Times. He spent the
time of his youth mostly in acquiring learning and united
theoretical knowledge to practice. For his knowledge of
the Prophet’s traditions, the trustworthy men of the age
call him ‘‘the foremost master of the Hadis’’. He has such
a minute and accurate knowledge of canon law that he can
extract the Quranic or Hadis rule applicable to any case
(very quickly). He speaks Arabic so correctly and elegantly
that even the Arabs of Arabia praise it ; and he has a perfect
knowledge of the Turki and Persian tongues; in writing
various kinds of hand he can serve as a master and guide to
others. He spends most nights in wakefulness, performing
the nafl, the daily tasks, the chanting of the Quran, the
reading of books on the Hadis, commentaries on the Quran,
Canon Law, and right conduct (saluk). The morning

prayer (fajar) he offers at daybreak, and sits on a prayer
carpet (musalla) elevated one spear’s length, sometimes two
spears’ lengths.

Next he appears at the window (of darshan) and delights
the eyes of the people waiting to see him, and listens to the
petitions of oppressed persons seeking justice ; here he stays
as long as may be required on each particular day. Then
he sits in the Hall of Private Audience and conducts the
administration of the revenue and the Government on the
reports of the High Diwans, Bakhshis and other officers.
After the prayer (of noon), he retires to the harem and takes
his meal and repose for his health’s sake. After offering
the ‘asar namaz, he remedies the pain in the hearts of the
oppressed. Before sunset, the officers in charge of the
armoury present the weapons before His Majesty. [536]

After the sun has set, kindling the lamps of adoration,
he performs the ‘asha prayer at one-third of the night past,
and then retires to bed... May the gracious God keep
the shadow of this great monarch for ever on the heads of
the people of the world!

3. Prince Muhammad ‘Azam, born on 28th June
1653/12th Shaban 1068, to Dilras Banu Begam, the
daughter of Shah Nawaz Khan Safavi. The lustre of great-
ness shone from the first lunar station of his forehead and
the star of intelligence glittered from the horizon of his life.

By the excellent training of His Majesty (Aurangzib)
he ascended to the pinnacle of perfection and gained an
abundance of accomplishments and excellent qualities.
That Emperor used to be extremely delighted with this
Prince’s noble character and excellent manners. He had a
wonderful brilliancy and firmness; in contests of quick
repartee and discovering the aptest word he was everywhere
very nimble-witted.

He had attained to the status of a comrade of his father,
who often used to say ‘‘Between this pair of match-
less friends, a separation is imminent’’. On the 18th
Rabi.A./8th June, 1707, three months and twenty days
after the Emperor ‘Alamgir’s death, he died after fighting
bravely in battle (against Shah ‘Alam I, at Jajau.) [537].

4. Muhammad Akbar, born on the ‘12th Zil. H.,
1067 /11th September, 1657, to the Begam (Dilras Banu).
Under the teaching of his father, he acquired sublime
accomplishments. His death took place in Iran in the 48th

1704] REBEL PRINCE AKBAR DIES 321

year of ‘Alamgir’s reign. He had run away from the side
of his august father to the wilderness of disappointment, but
two things prove that his end was good : the first is,—‘‘The
Emperor used to say that Akbar never gave up attending
the congregated prayer with the (Sunni) community and he
had not the least fear of the enemies of the faith (i.e., the
Persian Shia’s). Secondly, it was his fortune to be buried
at the holy Mashhad at the place where the shoes ‘are left
behind by pilgrims to the tomb of the eighth Imam Musia.”’
It would not be inapt to quote here the ‘‘letter by order’’
(hasb-ul-hukm) which the wise minister ‘Inayetullah Khan
wrote by command to Prince Bidar Bakht: ‘‘When Muni‘m
Khan, the Court agent of the eldest Prince Shah ‘Alam, on
being appointed his diwan, got his congee for Kabul, advice
was sent through him to his master urging him not to be
negligent towards the mischievous vain intentions ‘of
‘Akbar-1-abtar,* who has ruined his present world and the
next, and is residing at Farah} near Qandahar, and by the
advice of the ruler of that country (the Shah of Persia) would
not go away elsewhere. He is waiting there in the expecta-
tion that if the inevitable thing to which flesh is subject
(namely the death of Aurangzib) should take place through
the stroke of misfortune, and Shah ‘Alam would move out
of Kabul to Hindustan, Akbar would then enter Kabul and
Multan with the help of the Persian (king), that deceitful
carrion-eating demon (ghul).t (In Arabic) ‘‘The evil
example of those who take unto themselves other gods
besides Allah’’. (Quran, xxv. 3.)

‘*To this grandson who will (soon) be with his august
father ‘Alijah (Muhammad ‘Azam) let me say by way of

* Akbar is an Arabic superlative meaning the greatest, while abtar is
its antithesis, meaning the worst. So, after this prince’s rebellion his imperial
father ordered his name to -be written in all official papers as abtar and also
as the Rebel (Baghi). ‘The Shah of Persia refused to give military aid to
Akbar in a war with his father, (which was an act of impiety), but promised
to lend him a Persian army after his father’s death, for contesting the throne
with his brothers, which was a common thing in Islamic and other history.

+ Farah is south-west of the Mughal province of Kabul, which then
included Ghazni but not Qandahar, and Akbar’s presence just beyond the
frontier was a standing menace to the peace of Hindustan. (See Sarkar’s
Studies in Aurangzib’s Reign, Ch. VI and House of Shivaji, Ch. XI.) .

parting advice (wasiyyat) that as far as possible [538] he
should follow the policy of concord and abstain from fighting
and quarrelling, because to quarrel is to ruin one’s own self,
and a strange revolution will take place. Take pity on the
people, because the poor faithful community will be trodden
down (in a war of succession). (Arabic) ‘‘And the end is
for the pious and the next world is better and more lasting
than this. Do what you clfeose.’’ (Quran, xxi. 182 ; Ixxxvii.
17; xli. 40.)

5. Prince Muhammad Kiam Bakhsh, born on the 24th
February, 1667/10th Ramzan, 1077 A.H., to Bai Udipuri.
Brought up by the Emperor, he memorised the Quran, and
studied the standard books more than all his brothers, and
acquired a great knowledge of the Turki language and skill
in writing various kinds of hand. How can I embrace
within the limits of my writing his bravery and liberality,
which were characteristic of these excellent princes? On
8rd Zil.Q., 1120/3rd January, 1709, two years after
Aurangzib’s death, he fell, fighting like a Rustam or an
Asfandiyar.

DAUGHTERS:

1. Zeb-un-nisa Begam, born on the 10th Shawwil,
1047 /15th February, 1638 (text wrong by one year), to
Begam (Dilras Banu). Through the auspicious upbringing
of the God-knowing Emperor (‘Alamgir) she learnt the
Quran by rote, for which she received from the Emperor a
reward of 30,000 gold coins. She completely mastered the
Arabic and Persian languages, and in writing various kinds
of hand, such as nastaliqg, naskh [539], and shikastah
correctly, she had full competence. She appreciated the value
of learning and skill; and all her heart was set on the
collection, copying and reading of books and she turned her
kind attention to improving the lot of scholars and gifted
men. The result was that she collected a library the like
of which no man has seen ; and large numbers of theologians,
scholars, pious men, poets, scribes and calligraphists by this
means came to enjoy the bounty of this lady hidden in the
harem of grandeur; e.g., Mulla Safi-ud-din Ardbili by her
order took up his residence in Kashmir and engaged in
making a translation (into Persian) of the ‘‘Great Commen-
tary on the Quran’, which came to be entitled Zeb-ut-
tafasir, ‘The ornament of commentaries’. Other tracts

and books have been composed in her honoured name. She
died in her father’s life-time, in the 46th year of his reign,
1118, (26th May, 1702).

' 2. Zinat-un-nisa Begam, born Ist Shaban, 1053/5th
October, 1643, to Begam Dilras Banu. Her father brought
her up in the knowledge of the doctrines and the necessary

‘rules of the Faith. Vast numbers of people received their
livelihood from her bounty. ,

8. Badar-un-nisa Begam, born on 29th Shawwél,
1057 /17th November, 1647, to Nawab Bai. Her father
made her memorize [540] the Quran, and read books on the
Faith. She spent her life in doing pious deeds. She died
on 28th Zil. Q., in the 13th vear of his reign/9th April,
1670.

4. Zubdat-un-nisa Begam, born on 26th Ramzan,
1061/2nd September, 1651, to Dilras Banu Begam. She
employed herself in adoring the Creator and thus gaining
boundless rewards; was married to Sipihr Shukoh, the son
of Dara Shukoh, and died in the same year as her father,
(in February, 1707).

5. Mihr-un-nisa Begam, born on 38rd Safar
1072 /18th September, 1661, to Aurangabadi Mahal. She
died in the 50th year of her father’s reign, 1116 A.H./
1706 A.D. She was the wife of Izid Bakhsh, the son of
Murad Bakhsh. God be pleased with them !

the Mughal hall of private audience was so called because
every Emperor gave audience to his select grandees' when he
was washing! This theory is due to the false analogy of
Louis XIV of France giving audience to his nobles when he
was rising from his bed (whence the term levee), and the

BIBLIOTHECA INDICA

THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL,

The Bibliotheca Indica is a collection of works belonging
to, or treating of, oriental literatures and contains original text
editions as well as translations into English, and also biblio-
graphies, dictionaries, grammars and studies.

The publication was started in 1849, and consists of the Old
and the New Scries. The New Series was begun in 1860 and is
still running.

The issues in the series consisted originally of fascicles of
96 or 100 pages in print, though occasionally numbers were
issued of double, triple or larger bulk, and in a few cases even
entire works were published under a single issue number. Of
late years the single issues have been made, as much as possible,
to constitute complete volumes. Several different works are
always simultaneously in progress. Each issue bears a conse-
cutive issue number. The Old Series consists of 265 issues ; in
the New Series 1555 issues have been published till December,
Ist, 1947. These 1820 issues represent 268 different works ;
these works again represent the following literatures :—

Sanskrit, Prakrit.
Rajasthani, Kashmiri, Hindi.
Tibetan, Lushai.
Arabic, Persian.
Several works published are partly or wholly sold out,
others are incomplete and in progress.

The price-list concerning the Bibliotheca Indica is available
and may be had on application.

Single issues may be bought separately, but three years
after the completion of a work, no complete sets are broken for
the sale of loose component parts.

Itach issue bears, besides its issue number, a fascicle
number indicating its place in the Work and Volume to which
it belongs. °
