# History-Book-Bias-Prediction-App
Historical literature shapes our 
cultural memory, influences socio-political ideas, and 
forms the backbone of educational narratives. Yet, 
many of these texts carry subtle or overt biases, 
whether from the authorâ€™s perspective or political 
influences, impacting how they are perceived and 
interpreted. In this study, we present a practical 
framework to identify and analyze biases in scanned 
historical documents using OCR and NLP 
technologies. The process begins by con- verting 
scanned or image-based PDFs into editable text 
through advanced Optical Character Recognition 
(OCR), followed by analyzing sentiment and bias with 
natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Our 
focus is on Indian historical documents, particularly 
those authored by medieval historians and colonial 
writers. This project tackles challenges like extracting 
information from images, dealing with complex 
language, and interpreting context-based subjectivity. 
Our findings show that computational tools can 
effectively highlight biased or polarized language, 
supporting historians, educators, and researchers in 
creating more balanced perspectives. This work has 
meaningful implications for digital humanities, 
education policies, and AI-driven approaches to 
studying history.
